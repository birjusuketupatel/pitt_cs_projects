and already planning in fact of you have great ideas for things that we can do during our day and st louis tweet him at us let us know where to go where to eat what to visit where we should hang out we'll see their on thursday morning doctor ronnie jackson presidential doctor running jackson withdrew his nomination is be a secretary
jackson was of course nominated a few weeks ago
rather impulsive quick action by our president donald trump who seem to like jackson who'd been his personal physician and given him a clean bill of health checkup not so long ago jets and had no experience with the v of speak of and no experience running a bureaucracy and no experience managing a large organization
but trump like liked the cut of his job as it were jackson withdrew his nomination after reports came out that he did all kinds of stuff right emily yeah
he was candyman prescribing drugs
for folks i don't actually hold that against him all that much bigger us knew that supposedly crashed to government car because he was drunk and then he sounds like he was just a total nightmare to work for the opie lloyds the handing out near the park
like a rug gone up by giving out provisional and ambient on long trips that if there was the pounding on the young female staffers door late at night drunken we on a presidential trip and twenty fifteen be rivalry he had with another white house doctor sounded terrible i both felt like they baby badly so john
is this a case of a qualified candidate been wrongly taken down for
personal pocatello that aren't really relevant earth there's something deeper going on here i well i guess we don't know we don't even know if some of these charges are true been for to me they're actually kind of beside the point the to bigger larger points which is one this was this was reminiscent of when president george w bush although arguably he's less call
fyi than the analogy i'm about to make but i own eliminated nominated harriet minors for the supreme court because they're at least is a theory you may not agree with it there's a theory that somebody is not a judge can nevertheless be on the supreme court and make an argument for how that's good and beneficial people didn't believe that in that specific case but at least there's a there's a fear
agree to that was involved anyway that turned out to be a total disaster for the president for harriet myers in this case being a doctor does not mean you can manage the the a's it gargantuan management challenge obviously a doctor would have lots of interesting in
sites but it turns out that has a lot of doctors who can have interesting insights and could inform whatever he needed to do to manage it the current problems for which the new a secretary needs to be put in place are not ones with
our ones where somebody with management skill would have the relevant expertise it's funny one of the problems for the da is because of the hiring problems in been hiring there's been some questions have the qualifications of some of the road for some of the hiring they've done so it's kind of echoing it so that was one big problem and then the second is and it seemed from the
learning to be that this was just sort of more line of sight hiring by the president which is like oh he looks like a doctor he's my doctor make him make him the head of the just like you suggested having his personal pilot be the head of the
so the second problem and seems to me is that the vetting was so awful
that they were not they didn't seem to know about any of these problems or and then be didn't
you know if there are allegations against you
that doesn't mean necessarily should torpedo your job but it means that we should have an answer and you should have prepared the way and this is obviously not the first time they've had problems with vetting or had the problems with a slap dash approach show it's just another way in which the chaos of the presidency
this particular president he gets in the way of even its own objectives so that seems
to be the two big problems
i mean there's something so screwy about what's going on with a generally because the the last the secretary david choke and who was an obama hold up already yeah
and it was unanimously confirmed i believe but shock and had had the standards the this ministrations who commit an extremely minor active graft and corruption but no doubt
an act of graft and corruption with with for which he did after he fired scott crude and ben carson probably there to be fired for their act of graft and corruption
and yet they linger on there is a young us but because shogun shock and representative of the which is not as popular among conservatives which is that he was not so keen to privatized the bunch of of its functions and and essentially shotgun with sacrificed his his corruption was found to be
found to be a fireball offense because the koch brothers and allies and even people who work for shock and wanted him out they could push the privatisation agenda and so the real issues at at the have nothing to do with randy jackson and his lack of qualifications and everything to do with with the huge shift that apollo
she's policy ship that's being proposed and that the kind of personal disgrace even randy jackson is just is is a minor side show for what's going to be a huge remaking of this bureaucracy there and it's and i mean i do feel bad for objects and he's somebody who probably has a perfectly good doctor
earned it perfectly charismatic person who who indeed has built a great relationship with people in the white house but then he just gets and just get a second
and he let's say that some of these allegations you just then he didn't have to play his name out there and also right now you're wearing get will remain the personal physician of the president through two and a half administration's if you're behaving in this manner like the idea that some if they passed out drunk and has
to have white house officials come in like tip toe in and take things they need out of your hotel room i know i find that really mysterious like did not seem like he should be in that job from what we know if it is true well yeah that's the big name we also don't want to world which somebody gets allegations surnames them end
they're not true in a dense torpedoing their life
the question is i thought were you were going to go with this is how does he get to still have the job now because it seems like this would these would be problems you'd need to wrestle to the ground because he is a military person in interest in keeping with what you are saying david is you know he has had a career and you know
there is no suggestion that his service
for the military and overseas
was nothing but honorable and so by doing is bad
having his nomination go through in his slapdash way the administration that elevated him and the president particular who elevated him has now by throwing them into the meat grinder without proper vetting or protection has now cause that portion of his career to be the smaller port the defining characteristic
then then them all of these allegations it's another way in which it's not a favor
to him
the in another way in which they chant administration really lake
no breaks that people know it is supposedly elevating that there's a real risk worth taking these town i can i just say though i'm just going back to your point
honestly like the fact that he got drunk a few times that assume that much of what we have has been alleged is true we don't know that it is that may or may not but let's just assume for the sake of argument that much and it's true
hey you know handing out ambient and provisional people taking presidential trips seems totally fine now and middle east
self prescribing or prescribing you know to cover cover up prescription that i i know plenty of doctors who who do that and i think there are some of the ones i know are great doctors been having a drink while on a trip or even getting drunk while and trip yes okay your job as you take care of the president would be shocking of the present moment had a heart attack
and you were drunk that would be really bad and that's just say but they in the case but it doesn't do direct space
not these did not do not seem to me
the problem with jackson for this job was that he clearly was a terrible manager of the office well that's true ten that i don't act and i'd honestly i don't like getting drunk passing if that's true if your age
passed out drunk when you're supposed to be available in case the president has out the emergency come on you don't really think that's okay i don't think it's i don't think it's okay but nor do i think it is it is but it is like the worst sin that a doctor and they get ten finally i don't think it's a fire loyal fans i don't think it's a qualification to run the air
i think that disqualification to run the he's never run anything now and i am a as i value the health and saying well presidents more than you do that's not that's like all these people who who invokes national security would like than the national security risk with profound know it's not that profound with a minor okay when i would say
say is that
these two things are combined which is to say if he had no great if he if he lacked know mean you get has a staff of seventy
he wasn't wearing he wasn't great manager but even if he was a pretty good manager of seventy it's a huge leap to go and his main job
would have been management and so okay he hasn't doesn't have the relevance to experience but he's a great doctor that could be an argument you could make except that these go to whether he was a good doctor not so it kind of undermines kind of the only thing yet like he had to stand on the part and whether it undermines what a doctor actually does i am safe like lane
out that many ways in which it was not the right person for this job is like shooting fish in a bear
it's not hard to see and so to me it's actually saying he was drunk when he was shooting and what's wrong with being drunk when you're shooting the then i know there's no it's a small barrel they you to psych turned my manifesto
negative that acquire a when you have single barrel but she before shooting and small barrel it gets to be a barrel of trouble
i had an actual point i was going to make and it is this what actually think this is all set aside show but there is something that interests me here and it's because of the calf and the slapdash and know like oh you're my doctor your my pilot i'll pick you to run a major agency because of this lurching way in which champ is making
payments were watching washington have to go through this very
this weird the objects in which privately republicans do not want ronnie jack's tend to be ahead and give the a but publicly after john tester the ranking democrat on the relevant committees comes out with these allegations champ turns this into another set of political
oh another it turns it into political red meat as like the democrats are railroading this guy and this is all about my fighting for my people as opposed to any kind of
common shared normal understanding of basic standards and then you know a few republicans have spoken up and i'm sure there are relieved he is at an arab but there isn't the
bipartisan on we affirming of these norms and this broadway that really rejects the notion and dad until the moment that jackson withdraws you have this question of like okay so how where's the line like how low are you going to drag these republicans in congress down with you because the how are you
make them go in supporting you i've been feeling this way about scott pruitt to as more and more news triples out like now he have his main sponsor oklahoma senator what's his name gin in half as any say that you have a harmless and energy and in half expecting some reservations but this is after so many the allegations about pruitt
spending his ethical lapses it's it's distressing to me to watch washing ten kind of sync to this level but i think there is something so jumpy and well let me let me throw it back a un nuevo and take the case of my hey
a director who present trump was nominated to be secretary of state and who's having them just barely cleared the senate foreign relations committee
both gonna party line bowden will he will be confirmed with a couple of democrats voting for him i don't think look there are plenty of things that up i think company his views on a lot of things are troubling
his views on to be t que issues are bad his views on iran i think are bad but muslims but you cannot like credibly argue that he isn't qualified but he hasn't been a person who serve the country well and he's been a perfectly adequate cia director and and i think the the the fact that democrats are are
having such a fun time delay in him and making a fuss about him put puts a little bit on them to yeah
this is the guy who who under normal circumstances
just to go through on a seventy thirty boat without a lot of us i guess although there there's something odd about his point in may which is usually secretaries of state have a mark end of august resume than palmdale had before he became this day and director he was like kind of a back bench and congrats right so there's that word for for
trump and minnesota originally little if he's fucking movie brand a few well
rape but then exactly leg him bar haft yeah the bar has shifted has become lower and but i know i think you're right the democrats are responding to the you know parts of his record that they find defense and then in the ski like in the world in which we live on palmdale well
get through and you know trumps should be able to choose the person he wants for secretary of state and yeah i mean i take your playing with that i don't know do you think i generally think that will get you going to reactions one is that what we're really trying to figure out here is what the what the standards aren't for these jobs and night to lose our
sense of the standards in the pell mell craziness of the moment so the chaos of the white house create situation which somebody not qualified for the job has all these issues which which capture attention because they're not drunk driving in a car passed down a hotel fights inside like be the hanging on pills and being called the candyman that of attention
grabbing that's all attention grabbing and it's not impressed by any of that
are they are is over minor and that's all it that's all attention grabbing and and we've all been doing here is saying wait a minute there's this bigger issue here and what the job is and he was totally unqualified for that but you find yourself trying to pull the conversation out of mock and to what the actual standard should be for the job than anybody in and him whether they pass
that feels like what what were you know what's going on with pompano and and again the standard is keeps shifting and sometimes you say well he is he's he meets the standard and you realize the standard you you're saying he needs is one that's even lower from where it from where it actually should be so but then i have another point about pruitt which is that
he's going to testify on thursday and defend himself against these charges of the profligate see in his in his office
and and
strikes me that one of the most extraordinary things come out about him this week he's going to have reportedly he is going to blame his staff for some of the spending and things like that which
we're going to get santa those we had our dealer he thought that's the lobbyists house in oklahoma the only thing that and off seem to be distressed about because of his in his own state stateside both but what was what he has to answer for his is in washington he had this and this apartment he was running from the wife of a lobbyist and
on good terms fifty dollars a day and he said that he had not met with the husband of the woman from who's renting the apartment
and in fact it turned out he had met with him and novel and it wasn't just a random meeting
the sidelines of a soccer game but it was a meeting
and the lobbyist was representing smithfield which had business before the now
so that was a direct contradiction to what he said about a central tenet of the trump candidacy which was that they were going to drain the swamp in washington what is more swampy than a cozy relationship between a lobbyist for somebody who has business before and agency and the head of that agency and so they said well this was a this was a person
no matter it wasn't really about what was before the agency but in the emails that cbs obtained
from the lobbyists to prove it
it's clear what he's saying is you can trust this guy who's coming to this meeting with you so because he's kind of sees the world the way you do on this matter that's before the day so it was using the relationship that they had the existing relationship they had to vouch for somebody who had business before the yea that's like that's what that's what influence
and access is all about and that thing that the president supposedly came to washington to fix and so you have this situation where this isn't just like tiny little tricky tacky stuff this is and that's also true of the the president campaign repeatedly on the idea that his special understanding of the business world would make his administration
one uniquely able to solve the challenges inside the and then he named somebody for the post who lacks the qualifications on the central thing that he said he was going to be able to fix about the the i mean this is like goes to the heart of what he supposedly campaigned about that then did there there is an ex

strictly speaking at her arguments over the legality and constitutionality of the third trump travel ban which is levied unfair different than eight countries or maybe seven now six of them primarily muslim maybe five have been because chatted out now to get at seven with by primarily muslim country
your remember that the first early twenties seventeen ban the chaotic ban was suspended by judge pretty quickly after but not after causing a huge amount of distress at airports and in other places around the world and a second ban also was docked was also eighty six by a federal judge the third ban
it was repaired less hastily and was not so clearly targeted muslims is hoping to skirt perhaps the biggest problem with it which is the animus that president trump demonstrated during his campaign towards muslims than his his stated desire to ban muslims from entering the us while we straighten thing that so
emily
what are the key legal issues in the case both statutory unconstitutional
the unless ban
this is a doubt whether the president had the power to issue this kind of sweeping indefinite ban sell it very much a case that separation of powers and president authority and limits or not there of especially in the immigration arena and then the relevant stash it here is the immigration and nationality
act which on the one hand on a allows the executive branch to suspend the entry of a class and aliens i really hate that word for immigrants but that's a legal term if the president find the entry that their entry or the entry of any class of aliens and the united states
been detrimental to the interests of the united states there's another part of the flaw college we call the i a for short and and that part says that the government may not discriminate on the basis of nationality or religion and so there's this question of which clause gets priority here on
in looking at the champ travel ban and then of course you know this of all important in my view sub subtext for that's our trumps promises of the muslim than during the campaign and then more importantly because like let's set aside that campaign statements maybe but then things trying to send in
hafez about wanting to kill muslims out of the country treating virulently anti muslim videos and of sense we have that on a kind of red meat to the base on about muslims and muslim integrate immigrants is truly what's fueling this ban especially because although it's true that this particular order
was much more organized it's still not clear what the government's national security rationale is for choosing these particular country is and then you know having such a blank get on policy against admitting their residents right so so the conservative justices certainly found a lot to chew on
yesterday for example were very big on the point that how long do we have to hold the president's present statements against him how long the do the things he say in the campaign have any bearing on what he does is present in are basically a break and he gets a clean fresh start
and even if even if he has demonstrated some animals this president does he get a break as long as the his cabinet and people and his administration have legitimate reason to think this ban will have a beneficial effect on national security
that's one big thing that they that they focused on yeah i'm new agent start with that and then the then i mean i thought that neil kayla who is arguing for the state of hawaii and the other challenges in the band had a really good answer to that which just like well the present could disclaim these statements he made and one of the conservative just said okay well if he disclaimed it than than two days later
arkady issue that taliban order and chaos said yes and what seemed to be encouraging about that moment is dead
chan this and this is why i find this case so on
do i find it infuriating temp is getting to have it both ways right he both gets to be a this anti muslim president who is signaling all these things to his space and he gets to have like all the trappings of regular presidential authority where he gets to part
stand that this is about national security and that point that your made about the about not claiming is like the perfect way to at all has to do is be like know i renounced those views now i'm doing this for national security reasons but he hasn't done that the other one of the other points of the justices made is that if you the
islam band with the pretty bad muslim man that it's a very small number of countries that are majority muslim or affected it's only eight percent of muslims in the world live in those countries
so therefore it's unreasonable to think of it as a muslim band and offs of course it also encompasses north korean venezuela
clearly tossed in is a sop but now that word had john later
well did you guys find that point convincing that way of framing the question which way the won't let you just sounded like if you are yeah this was just as elitist big point like if you were trying to and nathanael francisco that solicitor general
china and you know ban muslims he would go ban all the muslims from saudi arabia allies advise where he would never do that right i what i find it i guess is that i'm sure that this is it has no real national security justification they have been way come up with any the incredible
they went back knowing that they had to come up with the justification and they manufactured something which i don't even think they've ever made public but they've just it's just sort of said we have a finding that this is will benefit national security and no one knows what it is and we're supposed to we're supposed to just accepted on the other hand i'm pretty troubled by the idea that the the courts are going to
tell the president and tell the administration
if they're going to go to second guess finding an administration is going to make i mean with this administration
it's a troubling but i just like don't like it to the person i'm really troubled by congress's failure to be involved here that's the the troubling part like this is an area where congress could very easily
come in and clarify and tell the president here are you pass laws that say here's what we want you to do or not want you do and course congress is unwilling to do it may give that gives the executive enormous amount of latitude to make decisions like this and an absent an absent the legislative
absent legislative action i don't think that what the truman administration is doing is is that a balance i think it's completely immoral and criminal and wrongheaded not criminal i think it's completely immoral and wrongheaded but the be the solution is basically political which is that you vote them out of office or do you think it's wrong i don't think that what they're doing
is on it's face like goes against any laws of the country are completely out of bounds i just think it's wrong and did the court emily
and i apologize for not having a means
not knowing this but did the court raise that issue because obviously the cord pays attention to the president is overstepping bands in the white house originally and defending this we all remember the slightly amusing way in which steven miller defended it which is that on issues of perceived national security importance no one anywhere in
any coach or in congress has a right to ever questioned the president which is obviously not the way it goes but did the courts wrestle with that idea of whether the white house or whether the president was overstepping is bound to the court i mean not to court yes i mean i think in some ways it was it a famed more and know first my david play at which is
with the court be overstepping it stands to question the president's authority right and there a i mean the more abstract the more kind of thirty thousand foot view intake of this case the better it is for tramp because then you're talking about these lofty principles of not just presidential power but the authority of the president
has to protect the country and end yeah we know here that we don't have any public record of real findings about why the government thinks that restricting a travel on immigration to this extent from these countries is really necessary and we're being asked essentially to take it on faith
and so to me the idea that you know the supreme court couldn't find some a narrow way to say wait a second this president in this instance has gone too far in light of this shadow of anti muslim prejudice and also this as continued lack of real on public evidence that this is necessary that just seems
fake of course the court could find its way to writing that opinion if it wasn't until you're thirty thousand foot point i'm always a really good one and when you get into specifics of what's actually happening it's so dire we know the moral wrong or committing there have been forty four syrian refugees admitted in the united states since october of the left
what if it six months yeah only eleven and two thousand and eighteen there are hundreds of thousands even millions of syrians the overwhelming majority of whom are people who are simply victims of one of the worst wars of modern history and who have no recourse and would be perfectly
the good contributors to american society and even if they're not that good to contribute to american society their people and terrible suffering and need and the idea that we as a nation cannot welcome them in significant numbers is disgusting and also we've seen this huge drop in tourism or seen an enormous drop in applications for student visas
the closing off of america by the trump administration partly put through bureaucratic channels and policy measures but also through rhetoric and and their vital vile rhetoric towards people who are an american is is the problem here and that's what people need to go out and vote on i just i guess
i think that we have a system where there's enormous latitude for a president to make decisions about things and i would rather have congress making law to restrain the president or the people restraining the president by voting in a new president than i would having courts stepping in every time people are upset
fair fan of that i don't think this is like every time people are upset about something i mean the other thing i just think we need to mention his car and moxie feel i mean we have this stain on the supreme court and on the presidency because of franklin roosevelt in the order attack you know detain japanese people of japanese descent during world war
to the supreme court signed off on ad in the name of president ah authority and national security is this completely and discredit add kind of horrifying present in that has never been formally over but that we all want to think we understand was immoral and is supposed to be part of
america's past not it's present and there's this sort of irony smile irony here in l k l who argued for ally in the town does as i mentioned used to be acting skills that are general under barack obama when he was in that role he issued a statement on you know
i can't formally overturn komatsu but he was not a chain that it is a stain on america's past and we are kind of that hovers over the court here when the justices like it or not so i want to make one final point there is one place where i think legal intervention is certainly justified which is that even under the terms the band their supposed
to be a notion of waivers that gap people that are certain refugees under certain circumstances ought to be herb or immigrants are people seeking pieces ought to be allowed to get waivers and that decision can be made by the state department on a case by case basis and what clearly happening is that those waivers are not being granted
there that's basically a blanket and isles and so that effectively we are completely banning people with almost
just a minuscule number of exceptions to to buy one to people who have gotten by these other the solicitor general said they were actually foreign it and forty people and argument yesterday so be interesting to see what that figure really amounts to but i guess my point is that if in fact this the government has set up a process and is not fulfilling that process
less than that seems to me a standard for a moment for legal intervention and and action if they're not abiding by the the terms of their own policy which i don't like very well i mean we should just end by saying it seemed clear from oral argument that the supreme court is going to allow the trunk administration to have the stan that
all the arguments we've been making the unsettling arguments did not seem to be on winning the day for the five conservative justices so that is a likely outcome one just side note here in the context of what the president says out loud and how it affects things in the courts gym pseudo of shannon is reporting that on
thursday when the president went on talks and friends and said that his personal lawyer michael cohen only did a tiny tiny for a little fraction of his legal work the new york prosecutors asking for expedited review of the seas documents from cones offices and home have used those comments from the fox and
friends interviewed to say that cohen's claim that his work for donald trump was so voluminous that will require a long and complicated process of trying to untangle what's protected by privileged privilege and what's not they are saying well if it was just a tiny tiny little fraction of what donald trump
it needs from lawyers then obviously it won't take that long to review the documents so it's yet another way in which the president public statements are affecting use legal standing although was a job offer the people who are around ten and continuing to work with i would say and trumps defense of a tiny tiny tiny fraction of trumps legal or it's still probably an inner
with them out because he hits causes so much legal distress everywhere
that the word legal i mean it doesn't seem like legal work was a lot of let michael cohen was doing though he did draft poorly draft to connect and given the two of his interactions with people who made these at least we know too many more than he was really a specialized in a special case although i was watching bad i was looking at the press conference and president
held in new hampshire about
barack obama not being born in the united states and cohen was at that a press conference which i had forgotten that was a long time ago our lives

the unstoppable force that is john dickerson was working on a titanic piece for the atlantic that story has just come out a cover story but the hardest job in the world the american presidency
this is a concept album that will be familiar somewhat familiar to get fifth listeners because hit some of the theme to john has strong doubt over the years ago first and it it is an enormous important and persuasive piece of work john i give you the next forty five seconds to summer summarize the work of the last year yeah thank you
why i think the party impossible hardest job in the world is i think a better framing than the impossibility of the presidency mean the presidency is impossible but we can only have one president of the time and so how to best manage that impossible job there are ways that the job has gotten significantly harder in the recent period
and this causes some of the difficulties we have in our politics today but three big ones would be the change in the national security picture since nine eleven
supine nature of congress which we've already talked about in this episode in and talk about all the time slash the rise of partisan politics and also than the change in the way we elect presidents and with an emphasis on performance
over other things
so that formative net not performance and i knew mean like rowing were forming of profiling were doing well on stage yeah
and they're all you know that's not the whole list but that some those are three big reasons
that are a part of it and then the peace ends with an attempt to say those presidents who have done well in various parts of this or people who thought about the presidency and would prescribe fixes to it
you talk about possible solutions to the unwieldy newness of the job is this a piece about president trump in what ways is that repeats about present and it is not a easier than right well that was something in the writing of it that we really really really really worked on a lot johns i right he has been asked a quaint wow
god love you thank you john spawns was my editor on this and we worked on a great deal because i think can we say as same the piece that president trump clearly elevates a lot of these questions and depending on where you sit depends on where you stand i mean obviously for his supporters he's blowing through the norms of the office the way you should and use
gotta crack this score attic system in many and he's exposing many of the horrible parts of the presidency that make it impossible to be efficient any of you are a critic you say well this long piece which is described how complicated the presidency is is like saying the presidency is like brain surgeons so boy we better have a brain surgeon in there
and so by detailing the complexity of the office
presidents critics would see this as an explanation for why the current president is not up to the task and also part of the piece also talks about the myth of the idea that you can have a businessman come into the office and just kind of with everything in shape
i think there a third option which is available which is that if you see a tweet that says the cover line about the impossibility of the president you can without actually reading the fourteen thousand words of peace think that it is an attempt to make excuses
for the president but the idea was to try to look at the president see and and break free of the idea that each president equals the presidency there is this institution that isn't well you know well over two hundred years old that has grown and changed and gotten out of shape and and sometimes to the great benefit of the country it has changed other times
and in the current moment there are these parts of it that need to be kind of stuffed back into form and the misreading is in the itself kind of though this is not the intent of some who were critical upon seeing
the title and not reading it it is in a sense praise for the article because one of the things we talk about in the article is the inability to see past the current moment in politics and how everything is essentially sorted through partisanship and team allegiance
which he has a lot of were that reaction comes from which is anything that suggests the presidency is hard is somehow an excuse for of the current occupant and that was really not the the intent was to look at the presidency itself this president clearly from the lead if you see it
his
is addressed but it's really looking at the the whole she bang i wanted to talk about the last action
a number of suggestions about how to make the job easier and less than pass a bond and how presidents structurally be in a better position and it struck me meeting them that you were in the motive exhorting like they were things like urging more centrist candidates to ran in the primaries
on or are urging us to change our unreasonable expectations and i wonder if you feel like there is more of a real on structural change we could make as a post asking for and the system to produce a different outcome people are just like thinking about it
currently at which in other parts of the peace i think you say are unlikely because to pave your is so hard to change widely last systematic things you could change for example so one of the things is we've gotta find a way to get the partisan lock out of our politics because the partisanship does two things it affects the selection of presidents
lifting people through the nominating process who are able to appeal to the passions of the most ideologically strong people in parties and that that ends up being a difficult place to govern from but it also affects congress which is you know again for people who didn't get a chance to read it a huge chunk of the pieces about the fact that
one of the reasons the presidency is so much harder is because the other branch of government is in is receding as denis mcdonough the chief of staff for president obama said anytime you talk about resonance you have to talk about or the eight eight about the difficulty in the president you have to start with the difficulty with were wise congress difficult congress is difficult because and this bedeviled
republicans more than democrats but it's because the primary process weeds out centrists candidates and you have parties where where the purity tests
in the in the parties require people to be less flexible nobody's and send devising compromise
and system used to do that in the past well if you believe that then one thing people would fix on his they would say well you have to change the role of money in politics
because it has too much influence and it creates the conditions
it make the parties this way so that would be that would be one specific thing you could do the argument about having more centrist candidates in primaries is another it's not structurally changed but the idea there just for those who hurt a fly by is joe california who served reagan and and and l b j argues that if that if you get
more moderate candidates purchase painting and primaries you will a sorry moderate voters participating in primaries then you would have a group of voters who witnessed not necessarily vote for the candidate who is most inherent to the extremities of the ideological spectrum now of course that that a
a lot of these suggestions require group behavior including group behavior on the part of the media that is just basically really a lot against a lot of our instincts as a country right now
two point one i actually don't believe that money in politics of then you're going to do with partisan divide i think the partisan divide with financially independent of that i'm not saying that there were no money in politics doesn't usually pernicious effects but i don't think that's the source of hyper partisanship or even in particular if you will love but i think would been a lot of these tend to do well they weren't in surgeon campaigns that actually are
money depended well that okay so that's a really good point that's true but the the money that is raised and that goes to keeping
i mean two things one how do you raise money you raise money by scaring them the jesus out of people and you do that by making relieved severe claims about the other side or about values issues which tend to be on the ideological ends of the parties
and so the need to raise money
his encourages a whole set of behaviors that are very extreme in order to keep raising the money secondarily and this is not related to raising money but the rise of interest groups that participate in politics and who keep who need to keep themselves funded and need to keep raising money for their own institutions do so by making sure
that the debates are set always at the extremes because if they are that makes it easier to raise money so those are two of the things that i would say would lead to the to the more partisan atmosphere but but but bear definitely not the only one as we as reality
one other point that i was thinking about i was asking myself why is it been president harder than being prime minister of great britain or chancellor of germany and part of it of course you know if it's the greater country than either of those and the much bigger country but part of it is that in contrast to a lot of the european democracies and even to a country like
china thing that we don't have a very strong civil service tradition it and
those are a tradition but we don't have the same kind of built in permanent government and the way that a lot of develop other developed nations do and that when they're transitions in government power and the united states had actually there's all this patronage it there's a huge shift in what government actually does day to day in ways that are much less extreme and
countries and that that's because we just we have weaker bureaucracies and more political appointee use and i wonder if there's that in a way to to weaken patronage and make civil service dog or which is of course go out runs counter to everything that conservatives want these days i will never happen but that's something i've thought about that's the structural kind of changed and family was seeking for
first question and i talk about bad engine and yoyo has an entire book he wrote about this which is like in praise of the bureaucracy and the ideas centrally is short
and what i talk about as shrink the number of political appointees from four thousand down till much smaller number and then actually make the political appointee process easier so they don't have to go through congress and have the kind of hold up but then you would obviously quickly you have to add to that that the ability to
kick them out of office would be made easier to and other words so you get a bomb apple him in a position it was gonna be a way that they wouldn't be protected just by the majority party if they happen to be an illustration of the majority party if you're going to lower the standards for getting them in not lower the standards but lower the amount of time it takes to get them in their posts because one of the problem
you see is that because you don't have as many bureaucrats who have the expertise and who have the knowledge of the issue and a lot of these issues are super super complex and they've gotten more complex and there's some great scholarship book
meltdown i like so much it has a great a lot of scholarship about the fact that the more complex we have made things more we've created these catastrophic the possibility of catastrophic events
with this increased complexity so if you if you increase the bureaucracy that weren't more expertise potentially the handle these kinds of things and if you made it easier to get through the confirmation process again not getting rid of accountability just getting the team on the field faster it would make it so that president's could in a in a functioning presidency and then decide
he wouldn't have helped with the with trump presidency because he has fired people so often and also a lot of the judge aren't filled but in somebody who sought to run the presidency and a more traditional sense you would have everybody kind of in their jobs able to start coordinating and working with each other and that made it for those who believe
leave that that would lead to good outcomes
that that would mean people would be more coordinated and actually be able to get actually on the field you can make a really good argument as stier does the trump presence he still isn't really on the field because there's so many jobs that are either unfulfilled or where people are still getting up to speed because the previous guy is now gone my class and as did you sell your
super engaged with this be thirty i'm thinking about it creatively do you feel optimistic like does it make you want to roll up your sleeves or does it make you feel like oh my god this is like this crashing monstrous wait on the country and it's going to like poll asked and nathan the old alternatively both i feel
there are a lot of people who think about these issues and how to make them better and if you look at the romney transition document of what mitt romney and his team were trying to do were at one time like six hundred people worked on this one of the suggestions is in the book is that we should allow candidacies to set up essentially
shadow governments early during the campaign even and not then not suggest they're measuring the drapes but actually use the transition and how they're preparing for it as a way to measure whether they're fit for the job because what's the job it's anticipating big complicated stuff and you come up with solutions for it so allow canada
once they get the nomination to set up a shadow government to run the the exercises that the me folks ran about how you coordinate because what people don't realize when they campaign and what they find out when they govern is there are all of these collateral effects when you make decisions the president is still engaged in a tussle over his travel ban is a perfect example of the collateral
effects of hastily made decisions
and if you look at what the romney team did you would be made optimistic by the idea that like every other human ever since the enlightenment the product of reason and considered thinking while not perfect and while nod eliminating all grief and sorrow from human existence never
less does overtime lead to positive outcomes and that was the thing upon which the the transition was was created when you talk to people who are engaged in the trunk transition
basically the opposite of that so the idea that there are people systematically think he may have how to make the system better that gives you optimism i think also in the reaction from people who are engaged as citizens there been a great deal and great number of people who have reacted positively to this and that the idea of trying to step
back from the current cut and thrust and the inability because of the shredding of norms that's happening in front of our eyes that keeps us rightly focused on you know what the captain is doing and the captain's tower that there is still a big ship of the presidency that has gotten a lot of barnacles and that even people misunderstand it some people wanted to be a kayak some
people wanted to be a barge and engaging in that conversation is necessary so that we don't repeat the mistakes that may have got us to the current situation that we're in or if people think this a current situation is just peachy that van allow us to know why does situation is better relative to the norms and standards that have existed them in the presidency before
yeah to the extent that people have got mad both of whom support the current president and those who don't have that's incredibly encouraging so those are two places of optimism john one of question your given all that you've learned about the presidency given all the challenges that you've outlined who in the american theme do you think is well prepared for the job who was
who could take this job and and do it adequately incompetently given all constraint well i have an answer which has a big caveat
so we don't really know i mean it's both the disaster and the genius of the american system that there is no kind of test that you have to take for the presidency
the genius being abraham lincoln which is that if you looked at him on paper
and the kind of paper test that i've you know either implicitly or explicitly advocate for you would say and he doesn't make it and he was one of if not the greatest president there are other presidents of course who might look like their qualifications and weren't a great president so you have to have lots and lots of humility my argument is
basically engaging in this question is good for on its own terms and brings us closer to the way the government actually works
it focuses on solutions all of which is good not that we can achieve some sort of perfect answer here i think that some of the mitt romney as a presidential candidate obviously leaving aside people's ideological preferences on policy
he had two things that it seemed to me were useful in the in the in the presidency one was he had run an organisation beforehand and there is some benefit although as i point out in the peace there's also a huge downside to coming from having run a large organization which is having successfully done so you develop patterns and blindness is that unless you come into the presidency
the huge dose of humility and say yes i have patterns and arts about ways to do things but this is going to be super different there's a business book called what got you what got you here won't get you there i think that's the title of it which is basically everything the got you to disposition you now in a sense have to forget because you have a new set of challenges when you need to use for your so a person who has skill in the
but sector are running a large organization and the public sector as to basically forget some of the lessons they've learned so that they're not blind to what they don't know but secondly and the specific case of mitt romney part of his job was taking over companies that all had different
contours to them and so we had to learn quickly about things that were not similar to what he had just done before and so that's pretty good training but again as i said that is in the presidency is the abstract you could imagine a situation in which events that took place would require or would oh
overemphasize one channel of the presidency perhaps you'd need a great communicator because the nation is going through some huge emergency and huge national rending of its soul and the communicative aspect which i think has been over emphasized in the presidency for that particular emergency might be crucial in required certainly the current efficiencies of president trump is a national or
order have exacerbated some of the problems in the nation that he might even want to try to fix but because he lacks the tools he can't so i don't want to over state the case for romney but i do in an attempt to fumble it your answer that so i'm giving it all right so the pieces the hardest job in the world by
why on earth them in the atlantic
both are new stand and authority up online

no i'm sure you do unfair to poor doctor get from what will you be chattering about john dickerson eye for the purposes of the series that i have been doing
for cbs with the producer cure and cleveland
i'm paying attention why as went to tulsa where i checked out some scholarship about floating and sensory deprivation and did a piece about it this week and then came back to new york and went to a place call in brooklyn
called lifts where are you can float and you basically float insulin in water
i'm and sensory deprivation and is very cool and i encourage anybody who is interested in meditation or
or just weird experiences to go try it out man i don't want to do that is you're enclosed there's something totally are in close so adamantly and dated at tesla nope when i did it
when i did it in tulsa
the tank was
it was a huge open tank and so you're in a big room
buddy
you're not it's not like closed off and that's because it's a brain it's they're studying the brain science what happens to you and when i did it in brooklyn you're into like a little pod which is exacerbates the feeling of claustrophobia you maybe you may be talking about feeling just cannot would not
and why would you do nothing and say now anyway what's your cocktail chatter my that does added this week comes from one of our listeners and i got a tweet from halima marquez telling me to look at a story on electric lit it's by matthew berthold is a law and literature professor and it's about the women
authors who judges tend to save in their judicial opinions and it's really this lovely meditation on jane austen so it turns out that there are very few female authors who regularly or even and all get cited in court opinions but jane austen is strategically deployed
in for quite a delightful reason according to professor burke called it's because she's so good at talking about like the complications and intricacies of life
so
i like this part in particular that she gets say that as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving so there was a california judge in a malpractice case who said something about how sometimes you have to have the whole story to get an accurate picture of events the seemingly hardy and pride fault darcy turned out to be a pretty nice
guy by the end of pride and prejudice
that touch happened to misspell austin's name but i think this sentiment is great and the idea that there are just these incredibly iconic characters from jane austin and that you could imagine them caught up in litigation because there are so familiar to us i really like that so electrical it
will post the link my or
going broke through the theme of shame most most about
we have not talked to the show and we should talk about the most appalling senate in the country who who's not getting enough attention
a war and more level horror unfolding in west virginia where of the republican nominee for senate to freeze
democrats draw mansion
fall may end up being don blankenship a coburn he's the former ceo of mass the energy he went to prison for a year after he was convicted in to mine charge related to mine safety after of course one of his own minds had an accident that killed twenty nine and minors and accident but many people think was caused
or was not prevented because of amenities very nice attitude towards mine safety to loose mr blankenship certainly encourage blankenship is just a piece of work
he is his election
they're all about obama judges and officials who prosecuted him he is not made a financial disclosure you know that's illegal because he realized there's no penalty against him for not filing he's like i don't want people to know what i have and so does not bother to make a financial disclosure form he spoke factories running west virginia his chief or evidence is in las vegas
not in west virginia he's talked a lot about his admiration for authoritarianism he's actually on parole while he's running
and he's a nightmare a primary it's he's not leading in the polls there but it's one of the things you can imagine there's enough anger and the republican primary electorate that blankenship who's running as a trump acolyte might win the nomination and then and then republicans will put
themselves in a very bad position to hold onto a seat that the to take a seat that they ought to win because mansion
easily the most vulnerable democrats running for reelection because he's a very red state so blankenship was a nightmare and
you would really be terrible for the country became a senator he's just a bad person that bad record and he's a criminal man
now that such a person getting as far as you
that's a for today the political guess is produce today and to they only by the way home
