anyway emily your bet it's nice to see you back
you you guys are both in aspen at the if that's
on this week's gab hoof what news what a week news justice can be retires and the supreme court delivers sweeping victory is to conservatives on every legal battle field and probably a bunch of others me even forgot but especially on the travel ban then a democratic socialist stamps
a top ranking and still quite liberal democrat and a primary does this indicate that progressives are headed for domination of the democratic party then civility
incivility anything is it worth fighting for what it's it let's use our best
plus cocktail copycat or incivility mode you just to add rate toward it i'm so civil that's not really i'm in favor of civility and yet i'm not a particularly civil person it's ironic or something
maybe contradictory paradoxical
but before we get to the meat of the show remember we have a live show philadelphia we are coming out you philadelphia weird can do a live show wednesday july eighteenth at the keswick theater and england side pennsylvania just outside of the city of brotherly love at seven thirty pm slate dot com slash live for tickets please join us
and there will obviously a lot of news that will be a lot of stuff to discuss and it'll be fun to do with you there so it's like dot com slash lived it tickets to join us on july eighteenth that because wick theater
a monumental week at the supreme court triumphed after trying for conservatives culminating with the sweetest victory of all the retirement of swing justice anthony kennedy
essentially guaranteeing has a replacement by justice almost certain to be more conservative
so the court ruled in favor of the trump administration and of conservatives in the travel ban case in the public sector union case and the texas gerrymandered case the crisis pregnancy case they all five four decisions with that usual split right yeah so emulate this is
you you are not appearing on seventeen different television and radio shows right now so that you can be with us so who is more inclined to be you at the ah yes okay so what does candies resignation mean for the court is roe v wade dead
candies resignation is just a huge thunder clap of an event for the supreme court it probably means the supreme court as been delayed will transform candy has been the swing justice for twelve years since their attire man sandra day o'connor and in occupying that santa role he moved the court
the right from where it was before but he didn't move it always to the right and you didn't lose giant steps to the right and his exceptions happened to be causes that liberals deeply cherish so can he will be remembered as the champion of gay rights in a way that was deeply important to civil rights
and you know progress says in the country he also protected the right to abortion into really important ways he was part of this compromise with connor and pharma justice david souter and ninety ninety two when it he had the vote either overturn roe or are fundamentally change he didn't
i opted to protect its core and then in two thousand and sixteen there was a big case with what's called whole ems how fucking set of texas where lots of state restrictions were purporting to protect women's health and kennedy joined the majority in seeing through that and seeing that the notion that closing clinics helps women and protects their health is
or text her house is just not that has no factual basis so he has stood there is a bowler in that area and then his other really important progress as set of moves have been in the area of criminal defense where he helped and the death penalty for people who commit crimes as juveniles and for people are intellectually disabled
old and there were other opinions to recently he called into question the constitutionality of prolonged solitary confinement and ted importantly ruled against california in a case about their terrible overcrowded present conditions so there were these set of concerns he had that mattered a great deal to the left and me
made him seem like a kind of pays the phrase guardian angel and i was reading about this yesterday i mean he was super fickle guardian angel because most of the time he delivered the kinds of fifth votes that we saw this week you know where we're talking about the electoral process by to make the vote harder or easier
to access kennedy sided with the conservatives consistently for example in helping to got the key part of the voting rights act a few years ago in gerrymandering case that was a racial gerrymandering case out of texas but he is there's just no question that a trump aplenty will be
more reliably consistently conservative than he will be and so guess roe vs wade in the right to abortion is on the line
it could change in a couple ways the court could outweigh overrule row or perhaps more cleverly and more and that kind of candy style of chief justice john roberts it could just whittle away at row and got it in a way that may be wed create last of a political backlash but we are in for a real sea change and american lives
going to be a roller coaster ride when this new justice get appointed and of course that means we're going to have a huge fight over this nomination so maybe john
that rollercoaster ride implies it goes and more than one direction and that this is just going down this is the down part or the apart and and i mean maybe i should say like from my point of view it's going to be a very rough rough ride to watch to live john looks actually talk a little bit about the political machinations here so
famously in probably the most successful political game but if our lifetimes mitch mcconnell kept that seat the new course which occupies open he refused to allow and in here in three refused to allow a senate vote and twenty sixteen to be election and to happen now there's an election coming in only one hundred and thirty two days there were two hundred and sixty seven
days when scully clear dud there's no chance that mitch mcconnell is going to delay vote in this case is there is anything the democrats can do to stop or slow were in vegas
meant have a supreme court
justice the donald trump wants i think the short answer for democrats at the moment is there's not there's not much they can do other than to deny unanimous consent for anything to go forward in the senate
what you mean shuddering every i mean they would think that's the
that's the like burning the ships move i mean i'm not that maybe that's not mean that said that would be like you have the center would have to just stop functioning period
i can relate do i not well i mean you but then the senate couldn't they couldn't do anything in the senate ever so what needs to be done well now and november
i'm seeing well i guess he needs to be down and doing well i guess what needs to be done as your guide and tidy hide camp and john tester and claire mccaskill all running in states where democrats think they have a chance to hold those seeds and then electorates earl or more conservatism they would be and that electorate would probably not take kindly to show
down the senate completely the benefit you would get from rallying democrats by taking such a move would in those red or states the nine that are red states where trump one it probably would backfire on those candidates and you probably have been some really camp put would bold and then then the story would be
democratic and fighting i just i don't think it would be politically it's not politically viable and also they do want some stuff that they you know the democratic senators and particular on things like appropriations bills and things like that i do want things that are a part of the normal quote unquote functioning of the senate but also let's assume they decided
to deny unanimous consent and they were able to delay thing such that nothing was able to happen that presumes that the senate composition would change and twenty seventeen enough the democrats controlled at which they don't do they think that's going to happen
they don't think they're going to control the senate and twenty and twenty nine thousand and two the
not not anybody who's i mean
it's like one hundred one shot because they'd not only have to hold all their seats they'd have to then beat hell are in nevada he looked vulnerable and the balls
maybe i mean i'm just i'd also right so you bet you'd you'd have to you'd have to run the table and we should note that this now any republican who is needs to be encouraged to turn out this is a turn out mechanism for republicans if the seed is not dealt with before the actual
election if it is dealt with before the election it still is a tidy reminder to republicans many of whom voted for donald trump
only for this reason that he could name people to the supreme court that he has a shot to name people to the supreme court in perhaps to other instances of ruth bader ginsburg or just as briar retire so he'll need the senate to confirm that and they'll need a majority in the senate for those years twenty nine thousand and twenty twenty and so would even further lock in
conservatives control of the senate republicans will turn out in strong numbers if they follow the behavior that they followed in twenty sixteen where they had doubts about the presidential nominee of their party but they overcame those doubts for the purposes of gaining control the supreme court that bad paid off for them is paying off quite handsomely and it would seem to help of have
either way an offense that democrats have already been energized and so now this is the kind of issue that traditionally republicans have been more energized about that's a really yeah that's a really great i mean i i would hope that democrats would get energized night
whether they do or not they were already like you know kind of i guess i'm not sure i necessarily agree with you about that emily in the sense that if if i think if there's no justice confirmed by election day that's a huge turnout mechanism for republican than almost certainly help them in the election particularly in bread or states and hide
can't race or and claire mccaskill race but if there isn't a very conservative justices who is put on the court in the next month and it's perceived to have been jammed through yes democrats already motivated but they can bet it will become even more motivated i think that will surely surely be helpful
yeah i think that's right i think that's right i'm going in and then so i don't know how we'd play this out but given that it's likely to go through how then if you're chuck schumer and the democrats do you play this politically in a way that kind of allows this to move through the bloodstream and even other words there isn't a fight if you know you're going to lose have no fight now
i'm actually to have because of their main thing obviously that lava them my fiance i mean i'm not sure about shutting down the santa be agnostic about that but if they don't put up a fight their base is gonna be this is the supreme court here
yeah yeah
generation
emulate let's go back to kennedy for a little bit what real practical difference you think his retirement
make them
certainly on abortion rates it's a huge shift because undoubtedly whoever comes in will be much more opposed to abortion rights and then can do it but on the other issues i mean he's been very conservative on almost everything else so is it is his last going to make that much of a difference because he's basically a very conservative on
on most of the other kinds of issues that matter
so two things it matters a lot what the reasoning is behind votes not for the outcome in that particular case after what happens next and candy was a mediating kind of slow like a simmer he was not someone who like to make everything happened rapidly
and mike turn up the water
fall boil immediately in the way that you know justice scalia famously was he was an incremental este and so there are ways in which behind the scenes he tempered that kinds of rationale is that the conservatives used for their five to four votes so for example he did though to uphold these
racially j mandarin redistricting maps and texas this week but when neil gossage and justice thomas wanted to argue that the voting rights act doesn't apply at all in redistricting which would that's like a question was originally sell in nineteen sixty eight the court has assumed the voting rights
act matters to redistricting for all those fifty years and there's a whole body of law and if we just decided that if the court just decides that is now no longer the case that's like a huge seismic shift in law instead of just like a decision against the plaintiffs in this one case that a different majority of the supreme court could easily move away
from so that's the first thing that i think matters deeply and the second is the abortion part of this if you care about that issue is a big deal i mean i wonder what you guys think of their staff to then and mr
wu i'm i see was saying this on the radio when i was on the radio with them on wednesday
you can easily they were arguing that you know between twenty and twenty four states are going to outlaw abortion because what was standing between them and having that outcome was the presidents of justice candy the knowledge that a district court would stop that law from going into effect because the supreme court would strike down and now that is gone
on and so you know jeff an alley were arguing that like within a year and a half or two years we're going to have a country where there are huge swath of the country where there are no abortion clinics and women have to travel vast distances to have access to abortion now you know because roe vs wade has been such a divisive issue for so long
aung i guess you could are that may be you know that kind of traveling and that kind of lack of access well either galvanized people politically in a different way or he'll this breach in the country but on the other hand i mean at least to me i just don't know how women are supposed to live in this is
society without a right to end their pregnancies and still be free human beings on the planet like i wish i could come up with that idea but i can't and so that part of it alone
seems worth really thinking through and i wonder what you think about the politics at that like are in those states that now have that freedom to make this move in those legislators how many of them will it really be politically popular to ban abortion i mean certainly there like a whole bunch i wonder what the camera end up mean just to
john before you enter just one data point which is something i learned is it was doing the research is that they're eighteen states that have automatic triggers such that if the supreme court
overturn roe abortions automatically outlawed most students so there won't even be any process it will just happen so so that's eighteen states that we already know if the supreme court expensively will bar abortion so couple things one just to your question earlier day that i was struck by the number that
and then tell me it's is right that of the thirteen cases in which there were five four decisions kennedy voted with the conservatives in all thirteen that's you're talking about this turned his term just it is a very funny moment for liberals tomorrow can into he delivered nothing for them this time and you know to me the most important things the supreme court is doing
the cases that affect the electoral process and the chances that we are going to have a free and fair vote and on all of those cases and not just in this term he voted with conservatives and this year he had you know teed up with great fanfare back in two thousand and four a challenge to partisan gerrymandering he looked like he was just waiting for
for some social scientists to come up with a valid measure are so that he could intervene and stop both parties from redistricting in a way that turns like of partisan advantage into an extreme sport then faced with these cases from wisconsin in maryland which we're well positioned for a big decision he totally hunted and
there's just no question that his replacement is going to close the door and a partisan gerrymandering challenges i think so to your question day that i don't know what the answer of had to it is i mean you just put those factor most interesting fact on the table which is those automatic mechanism
if local effort start to feel like an overplaying of the hand settled if what a lot of people for a lot of people the fact that abortion is not talked about all the time it's kind of they don't want to look at they don't want to have to deal with it
the mechanism that forces them to deal with it
comes from they may they may not like that it's coming from the conservative side so and if it feels like a general overreach that attaches to the court to president trump you could see a way in which it motivates liberal voters but i think they're going to be motivated more by the president at them i just don't understand
and i mean emily
you can speak was better than i can
we live in a world in a country where increasingly it is incredibly difficult for women to get access to birth control that at every turn someone is trying to prevent them from doing it the pharmacist is declined to fill the prescription the employer same they have religious objection to it sure won't cover it and now it's
the constraint on abortion but country on abortion drugs
do want an abortion been delayed having to sit through some nonsense lies about the effects of abortion on you i don't know hey i don't know why women who have to consider the possibility of childbirth of child bearing either because they want to do it or they don't want to do it why they're not enraged and every single one of them isn't voting on this issue
it's insane to me well i mean some women are in waves there are a lot of women who think abortionists and fall and they don't support access to it and sometimes when they're confronted with you know pregnancy and unplanned pregnancy and their own lives our family as they change their mind and sometimes they don't so you know i don't think
our united on this front at all i also think that they report
not just abortion or me and since birth control
yeah make a borderline illegal but let me have birth control so that i don't have to get pregnant
right and if the people who i mean there there is almost no space to stand and in this country where people say i believe in outlying restricting abortion but i want to make the most effective forms of long acting contraception as available as possible like please yes let's make it really easy and cheap for everybody to get i d's and
long acting get know that consistency doesn't exist i mean look you're right
women sexual freedom is on the line and there are ways in which the trumpet administration has been nibbling away at it in terms of reducing funding for planned parenthood the non abortion work planned parenthood does and also you're also right about contraception becoming harder to get are harder to pay for
maybe this will produce a kind of groundswell of women more women seeing that you know it's our lives that we need to be thinking about in voting on but i think it's complicated i think people's ideas about all of these issues get baked into their more tribal identities and
the women who are supporting president champ the like he is in battle they feel like he's their guy of their culturally alienated from a lot of the people on the pro choice side of the equation and i i don't know i mean in my change people who you know the kind of the people who stay home might feel like this is really a reason
to go vote i just wish i wasn't so worried about the ways in which we're making it harder for them to your point about the cultural emotion from the people who were on the pro choice ah it is a very is a really astute one and one the applause more broadly to probably something we'll get to and civility conversation but as the sense of the trump team being
embattled and
the argument that the culturally powerful figures who are on the side of trump create a rallying effect and so that's a larger version of what you're talking about on this specific as you can we just tally for a moment
oh the possibility here on the court and what it could mean depending on the way in which the twenty two thousand election rolls out and we'll get to the more in the twentieth team conversation but just if you think that the president will get his nominee would confirm which seems likely then he will his name twenty percent of the court the court will be a locked in conservative
the court that the president who sees and who came into the office with with his own theories about executive power that were beyond you know arguably any other president then the modern era who continues to get even more expansive it is feeling about what he should be able to do as president and who has
utterly transformed his party and the leaders in congress to be in accordance with what he's doing and not fulfill other their their traditional role or their constitutional role but who are really foursquare behind him use a president who has unity and power of a kind we haven't seen you know i think he's certainly about to johnson but i mean
johnson's democratic party johnson was making more deals with republicans them mean in some cases he had a split democratic party that he had to massage and deal with and handle there is no split like that in the republican ranks of any consequence for president trump so this is really a potential for an extraordinary historical consolidation for the president if his
his republicans retain control of the house and the senate
john just to continue on the team i do think there's a way in which the council vocation of the court as a conservative institution it's been seen it has very strong approval rating than it's been seen as a fairly neutral orbit or even though it's been fairly conservative for a long time but it's been seeing largely because it can do is presidents and so as a counterweight to a lot of what
people see if the excesses of both left and right and i i do worry that the congregation of the court as a conservative institution is going to be pretty damaging can people sense of democracy is a hold on the left that people are to be very skeptical because you have this incredibly expensive executive you have a totally super
and congress that will not do anything and then court which is a from mean that which the president and that which conservatives want to do and that could be quite disillusioning so i worried about that and that leads to the first of my last two questions which is one of the things that here democrats talking about now and i don't quite understand it because i thought this was
the new deal failure and it was illegal is expanding the size of the court so that it's clear the democrats cannot overturn the conservative majority by bit unusual me and because unless they can they can force justice thomas to retire with a democratic president they're not going to be able to do it so there's discussion about making it a bigger court is that right
realistic
how does that happen they just could put more people on the same way yeah
the hamish doesn't well the constitution doesn't specify the number of justices i mean even to be a hugely out of order
yeah that's i mean
the theory but other than having a magic wand know that is what mitch mcconnell dead i mean you think of it as a counterpoint you think of it is like mitch mcconnell broke all norms played constitutional hardball by refusing to give mark ireland to hear and the only way to attain to restore balance on the card is to add some new just know i guess
that but that requires retaining control getting diaz said if it's like slow but okay
because the ashes
as if you have the presidency in the senate is it a trivial thing a trivial thing when it's highly and trivial do you mean if it's possible is it possible as it just going either be pressure just a matter of that i nominate are temp supreme court justice emily basil on our eleventh i guess i'll join you in i lifeboat
i don't see what the legal barrier is to it and maybe there is one that was put in place after after hours car packing but there's no constitutional amendment that specifies a number of justices so i don't think so i think we're just talking about deeply embedded norms and expectations and politics and look this in itself this conversation being
live is a kind of check and restraint on the court because chief justice roberts wow
his while a far more conservative figure than justice kennedy cares about the image of the court he does not want his legacy to be the car going down in flames and becoming this holy partisan institution and so what he is going to try very hard to do when he gets his reliable fifth though is to write the kinds of it
onions that do a lot of change without seeming to do a lot of change so i don't think that roe vs wade will be directly overturned i don't think those triggering mechanisms in those eighteen states will go into place i think he will open the door for states to pass laws that effectively
close down clinics and and eliminate the right back row has preserved but i don't think it will be the kind of direct acts of aggression that would put the court so out of sync with the country that you end up with something like car packing i think as a political possible political cudgel out there the idea that is if you lose the center them
and democrats when the down guys when the senate and the presidency which you know that's a lot of hurdles you going to clear it seems like it's soothing it's a message to the court that you just articulated but then it's also it's some reason to hope for democrats
and organize and rally and all of that to turn out in these elections in the interim because the promise of it is whether it would be possible or not is not just elect a bunch of the senate democrats and and the dominican president then hope conservative satire it's actually do something affirmative and do something so that as a just a purely pull
medical turn out mechanism even if you believe that could never work it's more energizing then well let's get everybody in place and then just hope a conservative retires emily
very quickly last question is we haven't talked about some of the substantive huge substantive cases travel ban case with a big deal and i think a lot of people including me were struck by the contrast between the masterpiece cake shop decision and the travel ban decision were in the one case in the masterpiece catch up the court found that the comments of a single person on the civil rights commission color
oh so poison the well that this baker
baker victim of religious prejudice and then the other hand they found that the president's repeated absolutely clear crystal clear targeted comments about muslims did not poison the well when it came to the policy about who to restrict coming into the country so
contradiction get reckons old or didn't they did not i am not going into a square those things i do think that was deeply problematic as just a set of my are pointed out in our in my view enormously effective descent and the taliban case the travel ban case is the beginning of what you are laying out a few minutes ago it's cord not standing up to a
dan who put on the record his anti muslim prejudice and not protecting people for that reason now there were a lot of high minded sounding legal rationales for that all available and chief justice roberts majority opinion and we're talking about the area of immigration law and issuing visas that there's
no question presidents have a lot of power that's how congress designed it when they pass the immigrant and immigration and nationality act so in that context on in terms of the pure underlying power of the executive roberts was on strong footing the problem was that in order to stay there he had to be only
at the taxed of this third version of the travel ban instead of considering all of the presidential rhetoric that had gone into ed beforehand and afterward right i mean president chomp as set of my are pointed out had many opportunities to take back what he said and he never has so
that was what the conservative majority went for they held their nose candy was part of that decision both he and roberts basically said without naming trump it will be nicer if the president shut up and stopped expressing this like a horrifying religious prejudice but we're not gonna do anything
about it and so the beginning of a court that is willing to go along with the president of its party
who is a certainly out of step with many of us think our core constitutional values even roberts and kennedy deciding that they were powerless particularly justice kennedy who's been such a judicial supreme supremacist in other contexts there's there's something hard to take about that part of the decision who will

a battle his regime blue america between teal and navy sky blue and the deep deep blue of the ocean this week
the candidate who is so blue that she has red had her night on tuesday night progresses head maybe their biggest victory in in this campaign a democratic socialist twenty eight year old alexandria cause a cortez i never heard her name spoken so i hope it pronounce it correctly a leftist outsider defeat
added ten term incumbent in queens and queens and bronx district joke crowley he was also the chairman of the house democratic caucus that made him the fourth ranking democrat in the house it was it's a very safe district so the of cortez will be elected to congress she will be the youngest woman ever elected to congress certainly the youngest latina woman but there's something about her
a bartender a waitress recently a bernie sanders volunteer and just was galvanize to to run in this district and crowley who was at fifty six with the youngster in the house democratic leadership of
progressives also had a good night elsewhere been jealous former head of the and double a c p
one the democratic nomination forgotten or in maryland other that will be a tough race to win there's a very popular republican governor
so john why did cause the of cortez who is a novice who was quite young running against a very respected and quite liberal member of congress why did she win
well i'll give you what what appears to be the case and i don't want to pretend that i was covering this racers one of the nothing you hated more when you are covering races like this then somebody who wasn't covering her face opining about it
kidding but it appears to be what happened is that she had combination of things one crowley was this is a plus twenty nine district democratic district i think it's as democratic a district as maxine waters as district crowley's started as a part of the older democratic machine irish paul
all active in the district in a way that kind of old time new york politicians were so when people have said well he kind of fell asleep didn't see this coming
i think that that's clearly part of it there was a there was a debate in which he didn't attend she used ease and a surrogate she use that to say he wasn't awake he wasn't participating but he was not that he was active in new york politics and active in his raised interest as money in his district yeah
and so anyway but she was she was local
of the district connected to
that portion of the electorate that she could energize she wasn't just sort of an are is east and she was she's very good and very compelling and makes a very strong case for her policies she's coming out of the district which when crowley started was not minority majority and now is redrawn the lions and twenty antagonists and since first
contested primaries yeah i that's and first contested primaries in a year maybe yeah so she was a great fit with the district the district was a very liberal district and you know to be a white establishment male is not the thing you want to be in democratic politics right now
oh and she was very effective in using that against him
and then i guess we can address the question of whether this means what this means outside of the actual district
but you know she was a good politician and ran a good race to emulate key good run as a democratic socialist she ran for on medicare for all abolishing i think a federal job guarantee maybe free college and i think it's a classic case of were running as a really strong progressive make sense because it's a safe distracting
they're going to win it do you think that these issue the issue she represents in particular read medicare for all
more expansive jobs guarantee from the federal government or those actually winning issues
he had such a good question so that job scanty i find really interesting i mean it's tied up in conversations about raising the minimum wage and expanding the earned income tax cut it in a fact i'm agnostic about which of or how many of those levers to paul how but the notion of addressing inequality and that problem of stagnant wages which we still
have even know we have such low unemployment that all seemed super compelling to me i really wonder about medicare for all as the hell to die on for democrats and here's why
there are other ways of addressing the problems with our healthcare system that seem more incremental and thus less scary to me the medicaid option seems like a really obvious thing to try where you know a lot of the complaints from obama care people who have insurance they get through health care
exchange has made possible by obama care complain about their high premiums their high payments you look over at medicaid you see you know much lower are nonexistent copayments and you know a smaller network of care providers it's not fancy health insurance but it covers the basics and so i wonder
would be smarter for democrats
to be pushing that less exciting that more feasible alternative
unless i was sweet us to say less expensive alternative because i've never heard a good explanation of exactly how we're supposed to pay for medicare for all given our current healthcare costs i mean if we want to figure out how to like really really bend the cost curve and the way that other countries you know in europe and canada have and spend much less of our resources on healthcare than like fine
but in a world of you know exorbitant american health care costs i really wonder so anyway that's my two cents about that and i also feel a certain sense of like to read about having the next election cycles be all about health care policy again it's just not my thing but this is setting up a really interesting debate inside the democratic party
it goes something like this which is if you look at the seventh district of texas where the democratic establishment back to the more quote unquote moderate candidate over more moser overlord moser who is the sort of sanders type canada and all the the distinctions were pretty thin but most was of medicare for all floods lizzie fletcher was not least fletcher one democrats backed her
the argument being in these districts that are up for grabs that will give us control the house we need to run as more her moser put it the more liberal candidate you know people who were slightly less objectionable than republicans but we need to people who can win in their districts and can hope to deliver us the house and that's where the battleground is in these districts that are close the alternative
argument is we need candidate says democrats so the argument goes who are like most moser or who are more liberal who can turn out the vote stand for something follow in a sense the trump model which is stop worrying about like fine tuning your politics have candidates who really believes loud and proud and something that turns out the democrats
and that will deliver democrats to the promised land and that debate is ongoing and just got another into the extent that moser was her loss was idea an argument for the strategy of the establishment washington democrats this victory this week is establishment has an argument for the oh so should we also think of medicare for all as expand
need a possibility not necessarily being where the policy out room mates
right
good for you know with the overton window precisely when i think of it in terms of the overton window and expanding less billion people with yeah well the overton window is like what's the realm of to be that gets consider it as like normal and regular when i think about it that way i feel much more comfortable as i do have a tactically as you throw open the window because you never get me
get it but to get something less the and if you taken off the table right away you won't get him in close
just to wrap this topic up so crowley's last takes out hilariously the junior member of the democratic leadership in the house the other three nancy pelosi it's getting harder and james clyburn or i think one hundred and sixty eight years old three hundred and twelve years old and two hundred and sixty four years old respectively
no they're they're just ancient they are ancient they're all
these have been there forever and it's and
so crowley who is fifty six was the junior member it is it to me is a really terrible sign for democrats that a i i'm not like i'm not a congressional junkie by any means but i had basically never heard of crowley so the fact that the me they're never be that i can basically not name i can name adam schiff
and ted lulu and but that's about it you're and i think oh no you don't have a congressman eleanor home and orton pitches jamie raskin over the border that i can name barack i can barely any democratic members of the house is i suspect a big problem for democrats as they think about what's gonna happen when they take over the house
so john how to democrats fix this a problem the just naturally fixes itself that that that one pelosi doesn't get isn't the speaker somebody will become the speaker and that person will be elevated well again this goes back to this conversation with him the democratic party so when when there was
push and you always have to wonder about these pushes the same is true for republicans when they were the quote unquote pushes to replace john boehner nobody could have asked the second question which was with who and that immediately stopped all talk of pushes to replace john bain are now ultimately he was forced out by movement but that was because he resigned rather than there being an actual alternate
and i had the point here with policies there's always there's never been an alternative crowley was not an alternate he raised a million bucks for democratic candidates policy raised eighty eight million dollars for democratic candidates she's both very powerful inside player and knows how to raise a great deal of money for democrats and to the extent that democrats have enough money in their coffers which they need more
more according to their strategists to compete in all the places that they can possibly compete in two thousand and eighteen
they need nancy pelosi like crazy but for this long term problem they need a whole fresh batch and alexandria kazuo cortez one of the things about her that her moment onstage
here has shown is that she is dynamic talented did not swing at a lot of the pitches thrown into or that that offered her chances to attack the establishment in washington when dave rad be cantor and one his race and when you know rand paul was elected to the senate they said you know where this is a message to the us to
i wish front of our party which creates additional infighting younger candidates like this all of the women who are running and winning in democratic politics they are the new they are that they are the future of the party some of them come from military service which is also another really interesting piece of this story but how that gets from the moment you have now where
you have a leadership that's very old the crowley thing always seemed plausible to me not because he wasn't a good paul and wasn't working towards it but was the democratic party which is really now has more minority members than white male member minority and female members than white male members really going to be represented by a white male i just didn't think that was plausible than away
now yeah i think we have to rule out all the white man i just feel like that that to i mean that don't have a party needs to be having the face of it's generational on demographics chef right that's the much more pithy way of putting it it's interesting if you look at women women and or cause you know cortez of this generation lean democratic sixty eight

people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars so if i had a restaurant
i would serve anyone who came in because it would undoubtedly be a bad restaurant and i would be desperate for customers but you have such a good restaurant that as total understanding of your cooking and your judgment about food both of which are acts well thank you for tonight do you think that
it was lighter teeth i was just it was self deprecating disarm and self deprecating the purpose of advancing the discussion
in any case the red hen of like in virginia became internationally famous this week when it's owner at the behest of her staff evicted sarah could be sanders from her dining room because she and her staff were uncomfortable with sanders his culpability in an administration that is doing such wicked things too
immigrants and two children and others as well the standard episode followed steven miller being geared at a mexican restaurant in d c and also homeland security secretary nielsen also being heckled and jeered and basically driven out of a mexican restaurant in d c so there's been
there's been other things that have followed it has prompted a huge debate this week over civility in politics
and let us i think posit to begin with just to get the way this is such bad faith hypocrisy
from those on the right because the president is the most uncivil politician have any of our lifetimes and he was he is a he's a made a career of being uncivil and rude and cruel and vicious to people and so so the idea that that it is
that civility is is in question because democrats are the ones who are who are violating it is ludicrous that is clearly the president has gone much further in this than anybody else and also i would of course there are many other examples that people have pointed out that there was a baker who refuse to serve vice president biden a few years ago who was
himself lionized by the right and with call you introduce paul ryan at a reality but it that he would refuse to serve them or refused to take or didn't want to take a picture well they refuse to be what they wouldn't let him come to the bakery essentially said we don't want you to a bakery but it wasn't the same as providing going in his private life that's true was a pub
click event
so i think it is clear that this discussion should not be at all framed around the issue is this democrats have democrats violated rules of civility it's really more like is this a problem overall and and clearly both sides have their people on both sides who have done this and i think that the misdeeds the instability
he is far greater on the right because of the president than it has been on the left do you think this is is this a crisis is civility is civilly value that is important in politics these days
feel torn about this on the one hand i'm not so excited in the rudeness and cruelty of president trumps way of doing things becoming in any way normalized are like baked into the fabric of our politics like that is relief disastrous and bad on the other hand i've
have a problem with any of these incidents because i think that we have precious few ways to express our disagreement right now that are actually meaningful and so i could understand the frustration and kind of level of objection that these
incidents all reflected end and why people why it took specimen this way and you know asking sanders to leave a restaurant isn't the same it's like throwing tomatoes at her i mean we're talking about a peaceful kind of protest and so that matters a lot to me and once anything starts to cross the line into like physical
confrontation or for threats of violence than i completely shift and maybe the problem with that position i'm taking right now is that your opening the door and walking a few steps down that path and sell that line i'm trying to draw won't really exist in a clear way and i should be more worried about that here's the one other thing
i also wonder about it's the power of social shunning so you know when i read about like parties on the hamptons where some you know democratic social aid is inviting jared and vodka
to calm and like schmooze and rub elbows with chuck schumer that i find absolutely enraging actually because i would imagine that it would matter to jaded and vodka not to get invited to those parties and it seems like that upper crust world
has a chance to enforce some social norms and impose a cost on policies that are hurting so many people i feel like if you believe that the trump administration is really hurting people you should not be including people on your guess you are crucial to that endeavor
this other kind of particular kinds of incivility were talking about of course are a little different from that on and more problematic although like i said they didn't really bother me but john they prohibited you well as if there's so many different pieces of this i think that
i just as a human matter i tend to want people to be several i want to be civil to other people and want them to be civil to me in fact you're either
you live that every day
the the thing of it is though our government and our politics first of all our country was founded and we will celebrate next week in an active incivility when you throw the t into the harbor you are not being civil revolutions not civil and then the founders created a government that embedded in it and was designed within
civility in mind they knew we would behave like dogs they knew ambition would fight ambition and so they said let's separate the powers let's have everybody fade out but create a system in which they can fight it out but not resort to force of arms fight it out without shooting each other so incivility is baked into our system not because we think it's awesome although
i think you can make a case that the zigzag pattern of progress of the american story is a result of occasionally people say being in civil the other expression that comes into play here is when you wrestle with a pig you're not supposed to wrestle with a paid because you get dirty and the pig enjoys it it's clear that that president trump is highly skilled at using
ing diminishing nicknames untruths and so forth to act in and uncivil way against his opponents so why would you engage in a battle on the exact same terms that he has been successfully good at so any active incivility whether it's at the donald trump maxine waters level or the restaurant her level or the chanting at a rally level
or should have some theory behind it that to the extent that it is just purely an act of impulse and active wielding power and act of domination eat strays from the seville the incivility that was sanctioned and in fact designed by the founder i want to make three grip point first of all to your last point there john what was interesting about the
restaurant or the red hen owner is fitted with a private at this was not something she'd probably thought she it with publicized
an employee of hers wrote something on facebook and then thorough standard publicized it but it was not it wasn't committed as an act of of public disobedience or public incivility it with it was it was a private so i do think that bet she deserves
but deserve to be noted to put your other points one is
one reason why tactically incivility on the part of democrats the towards trap administration officials is an effective strategy was on display this week which is that the cause about which this instability occurred the separation of children if a wicked wicked crime that our government is committing towards
the most vulnerable and innocent people on the planet right now it is disheartening that we spent the week or much of the week and political journalism is but much of the week
moaning and distressing over the fact that sarah could be sanders at a different restaurant
and that was a huge distraction from the thing that we were all exercise drought last week and it is it is manifestly the case that much more effective act of disobedience would be if you want to change policy would be related to these children would be at the location where these children are would be aimed at
helping these children by by making our standards at least a partial victim making her been able to portray yourself as a partial victim it's a complete distraction from that what you want to accomplish which is the reuniting have children with their families i met a humane treatment of these migrant families so i mean
the customs and border patrol did back down this week i'm not saying it was because of i'm sarah sanders and harassed with an authentic hundred thirty enters in a restaurant was because of other other light been shined on it that is now less less bright
but i think also the country has rejected this approach i mean not universally he but the public are the children reunited well that's yeah there's like five hundred of them they're working on the other two thousand i believe me i mean i am completely with you on wickedness and are and it is really kind of unspeakable what we've
dan and on what it's been done in our name to these kids and families it's terrible
i am interested doubt that the champ administration has backed down off some of the worst parts of that and i wonder it's hard to know exactly what all the factors are that went into that change but it is one of the only times that we've seen them back away like this to your tactical point day that i think that and tell me if i'm wrong but i think it would be useful to explain that to say
do in private act and public leaving aside the morals for a second tactically a there's a difference between what you do privately in a restaurant and what a a party in the minority should do publicly as a matter of strategy to gain advantage
so i want to make one other finalists or separate point which is that one of the reasons why i think the left is cotton this bind around it and were why incivility of so attractive if it essentially the institution that the left controls and this country right now is the culture and read
restaurants are part of the culture
and you know your hollywood stars are part of the culture
and as a result
the the forms of protest that liberals are using most vociferously are ones that are cultural forms of protest where you have people griping it might but not great
belittling where people chastising my pen for the performance of hamilton or sandy same be and it's you know i don't think the people who are two are committing these acts are wrong headed and i think they're their heart is in the right place and there certainly their ideas and right place as it happens when people don't i think the public at large does
not really want to hear celebrities doing this and i totally agree and when we talk about cultural alienation i mean i just keep going back to interview as i did with republican college educated women who voted for donald trump them are so pissed that katy perry had been telling them to vote for hillary and they just felt like the trade and
also just irritated that she had any kind of opinion
yeah and that becomes it's own it's pushing on and that's a more powerful governing factor in their behavior than anything else one of the thing i'd just like to throw in there is people i think rightly bemoan the over emphasis on sarah sanders being on disinvited from the restaurant i get it makes perfect sense to me as something we can all participate in
have an opinion in we kind of feel and and recognize those feelings in with members of our our own family by you have to recognize that part of though formative design of what is going on here is to bait and debates people and create those kinds of conversations that lead to the culture
all positions that emily's talking about so if you're a tactician who is has the interests of the democrats it hard you have to basically begun to your analysis it seems to me that these kinds of these kinds of ovary over coverage of these kinds of stories will happen
you can't rely on restraint in the culture and therefore this is yet another argument for your point david it seems to me from a tactical perspective to keep the focus on the underlying value that has been challenge which in this case was the separation of children from their parents and not expect that the press won't cover the shiny object of the moment

what's going to kill chatter when you guys are at your fancy szymanski fancy pants as been idea festival cocktail parties and don't try to pretend that they're not cocktail party is because i've been there there are cocktail parties
what you're going to be chattering about to your fellow thought leaders john
i got a cocktail parties are seven dollars
cocktail data is designed around
i say there
i'm sad you're not idea i chatting about something i learned about last night which i didn't know existed and it's one of those things where or how can i not have known and so perhaps people hear this and say oh have known about that for ages and you more on anyway it's something called z i p kid which is a chinese company that has signed up twenty five thousand teach
teachers in america and they're not all not all of them are current teachers not all of them are even accredited teachers between five thousand and teachers people in america who teach chinese children how to speak english and it takes place over sort of essentially like skype a or two classes to two to three twenty five minutes
sessions each week and basically there is this army of teachers helping chinese kids learn across the globe
just seemed fascinating to me that you'd have these connections with somebody sitting at their computer table in the middle of texas somewhere and then a young kid in beijing somewhere learning to learning english and it felt like something there's no i don't think there's a it now operates and thirty five countries but i don't know if there's an american
an equivalent but the distance learning thing has always seemed kind of more promise than reality and the chinese seem here to have been able to company now has the three billion dollar valuation they seem to have figured out a way to have this work
at some level anyway in hooking up resource to need even when it's all the way across the globe emily
i feel like i can't let the week pass without some mention of the supreme court decision which is seriously diminished the influence public sector unions am this is add five four decision their opinion unless by a samuel l e et al
really fitting because the lido essentially called for this case six years ago and what happened was that the court overturned a precedent from the nineteen seventies called a booed in which at that time the court said luck unions can charge dues to all of the people they represent all the people who are going to benefit from their collective bargaining
and they have to give back or they can't charge of the part of the dues that would go to the political activities of the union because the first amendment protects the rights of people not to have their not to be forced to speak slash contribute money to a cause i don't believe in but all these folks still have to pay the part that goes to pay for collective bar
running and that's just been part of how public sector unions have funded themselves and have been able to represent everybody and in particular
profession or field and and i should also add states have chosen to do it this way we were talking about twenty two states that affirmatively wanted to give public sector unions this power so the supreme court over old to booed and said that this issue of compelled speech extended to all the dues that unions were collecting and
and mattered more than what we think of as the free rider problem with you know which is kind of obvious here like once your you can get all the benefits of union membership without paying for it
some people are not going to pay for it because they have other things to do that see more pressing with their money
you know their couple of things here in an ideal world we would not be relying is heavily on public sector unions as we do for a lot of like democratic party liberal cause making we would have more powerful private sector unions since that's the area where you know unions are going up against big corporations but this is the
world we live in and in given that is the world we live in what a leader and the conservatives have very successfully done is strike another blow another partisan blow in the political arena with this decision and you know this decision it's in combination with all the other moves the supreme court made or didn't make this term and laugh
the term and all the way back to siddons you citizens united that have just changed our political process in a way that benefits very wealthy people and tends to benefit republicans and that is a pattern which if you care about democracy should disturb you because it is going to make it puts more
pressure on the fairness of our elections at a moment when they could not matter more
much better
