in the event of a global communications breakdown do the following stay inside
the with strangers
i don't trust and most importantly
do not
what happens next commercial and the new
me will be i rated r select theaters now and i'm net flicks to separate the following pod contains explicit language

what political government a book that when he came the caravan get better addition i did with plot battles with your back from vacation which explains the in my voice was columbia south america which i strongly recommend we may talk more about that later
but man do i recommend columbia and john dickerson of cbs this morning in new york is also back hello john hi can you have path in your voice your pet in your step
oh i don't like a path in your voice
well i suppose you can but i just have always heard it when it's in your step and then leads me to the question of what in god's name is pat anyway
yeah it's my boy
my one of my kids try to energy during yesterday for the first time and it was crazy because he was so pepe it was those things are dangerous
there was pep that was in a voice that's another that yes sugar and caffeine
who knows what else that other voice that is of course and as one of the new york times magazine and was back from nowhere she home the good ship deb first brilliantly while we were gone through storms and whirlpools hello emily
and if pepe shirt for pepe then you definitely to have that in your voice so i rescind my previous man
that before we get show i learned an amazing fact on twitter emily i don't have you noticed with to someone with tweet treated at us asking john about his first career yeah that was at hari john was a member of the atari youth can now he's literally have added i believe i can help
john a can't just give us the ten seconds what do you mean you are on the atari
you cancel makes it said well i guess who it was actually called as the atari youth advisory board which sounds more corporate but the youth council sounded like we're all like little brat her shirts or something but when i was a kid you're all like introduced to computers i had a tear as eighty and then i exchange that for and atari eight hundred which is the first i think the four hundred was the
first model anyway and i was like a little computer programmer and because i was a little computer programmer with a guy named robert all britain who is now the publisher of politico actually we wrote programs
did some things with computer games which
may have a while anyway we played a lot of computer games anyway we worked at the consumer electronics show in i think it was nineteen eighty two when that was just starting and then they formed this thing
buys reward which was an effort to get input from their computer users it was mostly on the computer and not the video gaming end
and unknown
i got it as a result of doing that i got they flu us out too
california we had like three days of meetings that i kind of barely remember
and then we were given an atari twelve hundred which was like sleek new computer and then not that long after that there they were basically swamped by pc is an apples and
they took your advice
but i remember one of the first things we got in addition to the twelve hundred was a copy of exile for
or the atari and we were supposed to use it and make recommendations and do things like that and i had a a b s which they were called back and
which i guess would essentially have been my own web page that you could dial into that the amazing i went for too many more stories of that on this week's gab fest robert mahler has reportedly told the president that he is a subject but not a target of investigation what on earth does that mean
i can explain then president trumps impulsive fury tweets about immigration and amazon what impact might they have on public policy and then why does the administrator scott still have a job while through up cocktail chatter and a reminder we're just
four weeks out from our st louis show me a great guess and candor the former secretary of state of missouri for senate candidate now voting rights organizer and activists is going to guest with us
the shows on may second child concert hall and me with there's still some tickets left it's can be very very fun please go to sleep that com slash live for more details and to get tickets a washing post story on tuesday dropped two rocks and the pond of the russian investigation the first is that robert muller an effort to
suede the president to sit for an interview presumably told hammer told his lawyers back in march that he the president is not a target
of knowledge investigation is a subject of knowledge investigation muller secondly also apparently said that he was planning to create two reports about his investigation the first which might come out there might be completed and sent to rot steam in june and july would be about the possible obstruction of justice and the second would be more about
russia and russia and interference inclusion and that might come later so john first of all where did this story come from so the the answer seems to be moments he does not seem to be leaner leaking at all so that suggests it has come from the president law know that lanka so i one of the reasons we know that it's not i mean well
another development this week not to there were other many other developments but one of the developments this week is that the special counsel responded and the forty four page memo to the assertion by paul man affords legal team that special counsel had gone beyond his brief in charging man afford for crimes or
alleged crimes he committed before he ever was connected to the trump administration and he produced a memo that rod rosenstein had or the approval from rod rose and sign allowing the special counsel to go ahead and go after man afford it was almost a year old was august twenty seventeen dollars i'm going through this is we're just now learning about that authority from rosenstein the fact that that was never leaked even
when the president was calling this a weird hunt even when metaphor for it was first charge and the president and then affords lawyer said that
i had gone beyond his scope of his investigation the fact that didn't leak even when it would have been in the special council's benefit to have it leak in the papers that gives you some sense of how are strange he is there is some feeling that this could have company presidents legal team on one side of it or the other one being the president saying hey i'm not a target isn't that great
you see i told you know but he was suspicious about my behavior and other side sad or another argument was that this would leaks by the people who said no no it's a trap being told you're not a target is meaningless and it's just an effort by mahler to get you'd come in and talk and say things that will get you ultimately in trouble
because of your because of the tendency not to tell the truth about things that took place at first this was a bombshell and then as i thought about it and read more about it i was wondering emily whether if you're a target
like isn't being a subject to sort of a precondition for some day being a target and isn't being and sub don't you really want to be a witness not a subject just fyi away right away and doesn't this puts you like the difference genius subject and a target can be like two minutes yeah and and then finally also the reason this report is interesting
right is that there's an argument that you can't you can't date presents anyway so she could never be a target because he's a president and therefore if it's going to have to go through the impeachment route you would never say he was a target even if you had a picture of him with the smoking gun are and where john you've gone through like the in one question to let's narrow it first
what is the distinction between subject and target and why does it matter and is john correct that that one is it's on the road to be lend can be on to the other so being i think it's helpful to talk about as being the criminal target so like once your identified in that way it's the investigators and
whoever that prosecutors are saying like your our guy or the person who are trying to date and you're a subject of the investigation than they're interested in you they could turn you into a sure i get that they haven't yet made that decision so it gives you more incentive to cooperate norm i i like a normal person in the story and not the president in
this case the peril of that trumps legal team sees is that if he goes and does this interview and makes false statements are his mother or reason to believe he acted correctly that crush where and the obstruction of justice statute when he fired com year when he did like the twelve other things that could be material for an obstruction charge
the trumpet be putting himself in jeopardy and essentially moving himself from subject to criminal target zone so yeah i don't think it's hugely meaningful the champ hasn't been yet designated a criminal target if if he had been that would have been really shocking and we would not want to see that piece of information leaked
way there is this whole separate discussion about whether or when you can end date the president which i don't know if lot of talk about right now or not we we will get that second but let's continue on this subject target distinction first second and my i don't understand maybe maybe i'm i'm malicious the deceptive con i don't
by prosecutors need to tell people they are criminally targets are subjects why can't they just lie about it why can't they just be like oh we just want to talk to you
if i have kept why is it necessary to to give them a heads up morning by the way we want to charge and then going out the miranda warning where we say to you like anything you can you say can be used against you you have the right to a are all those things have to do with questioning someone in a setting in which they could be in criminal
jeopardy and sale it's actually really important that we don't let the prosecutors learn people into speaking without layering up without having a sense of what their rights are and what their exposure as and also isn't this in the context of in this might be useful side road to go down briefly isn't is in the context of the negotiating team about getting him
to testify doesn't have to testify of the grand jury has been impaneled or his only remedy in theory if you wanted to push it all the way to the wall is to plead the fifth but presumably mahler's trying to get something short of that and therefore is entered into these negotiations with his lawyers and so the first reasonable question a lawyer would ask is okay boy what is the con
text of this conversation that the president is going to have with you what is he is he a witnesses the subject is he a target
exactly of the things are too i mean i think the answer to your question is i mean i think that champ has to testify i think the supreme court precedents on the nixon tapes makes that clear but if trump or wants to challenge that he can go to the supreme court and we can get a definitive answer to whether the president has to obey
hey you know a subpoena or a request for testimony a special prosecutor now bill clinton decided to do it and didn't push the question to the wall and yes i suppose trump could plead the fifth and that would be fascinating given that we're not you know so to go back to the question of whether the present can be indicted what's going on in that context no clue
are supreme court law at all but a justice department memo from nineteen seventy three renewed in two thousand which says kind of briefly that the justice department has concluded that the president cannot be prosecuted and then i think just in a sentence or two it includes the word indictment in there that you know muller will feel bad
by that memo walter danger of former solicitor general for clinton min interesting argument a week or two ago that actually the president could be in day did because you have to you have that's the only way to preserve the criminal charges because otherwise like the time for them collapse and so you could date a president even if you can't force him to go through a trial but
that from mothers point of view indicting the president is not a by the books move and i think that's why we all think it's so unlikely that he is going and take it upon itself to do that
can i ask a question about that
the justice department memo office of legal counsel memo that you're talking about is that refers only to federal indictment and a federal prosecution state does this any of this apply to a state the state of new york take the evidence it's been gathered insofar as it applies to a crime it might have been committed new york
and and really london i don't think we know the answer to that i would have thought the reason or one key reason why the department of justice or by the federal prosecutors could not and date is that federal prosecutors work for the president and that's the executive the justice department as part of the executive branch which is supervised by the president and that's weird but state attorney general
i don't have anything to do with the president and so and also i don't see how the state department just as could bind what state attorney general's could do well in fact the nemo in two thousand from the office of legal counsel says very broadly that the department of justice concluded and nineteen seventy three that the indictment and criminal prosecution of the setting
resident when unduly interfere with the ability of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned duties and would violate the constitution separation of powers
so i don't think that completely opposite and has chen it doesn't say federal only and the constitutionally and same duties i suppose could argue extend to stay prosecution but the idea of violating separation of powers would seem to be limited to federal and prosecution for the reasons you gave the president it seems to me
has three options with responsible or one use pound sand to use take the fifth and three is cooperate town sand is you don't have the right asked me on the president i can do whatever i want i have powers that are you know that you're infringing on to make a constitutional challenge about when
you can ask these questions at all the other is to say sure you to ask them but i have a i have a constitutionally protected right to defense against self incrimination and those are two different things right yeah and he had any could do the first in there he is some suggestion that he is at least noodles with the first by basically saying the version of
president nixon said which is when a president does it it's not illegal
and therefore if you're looking into obstruction under the power of the unitary executive i can fire my f d i a director for whatever reason i want and therefore you can't ask me questions about that because it's perfectly legal in there are no grounds to have a conversation the reason i think this is interesting is it feels like he could go down that road and i
you know people's responses to this they say no it's all very clear he absolutely has to testify as if that would cordon off his ability to try to make this claim kinetic the and it may not work but i still think it's a possibility that he might make that claim i agree with everything you just said can i ask you that guys a question
in is you have to negotiate with my lawyer
rather i've taking care of that you have to answer questions unless you're gonna play in fact okay so you know the part john mentioned earlier in are quite messy
the way through this about reports so we know from this news report that mahler's supposedly contemplating these two reports that presumably to rosenstein that's what the statute calls for it doesn't call for muller to make them public himself and also in this statute may or may not there's an interesting debate about this
discourage him from writing along ken starr like report in any case is to reports supposedly the obstruction one comes first and then the one about russian interference come second and get that like i had the same one i don't understand like i really don't understand so if the i mean maybe this is of course false but let's just go
go with the news version that we have right now
why are we going to be able to understand the evidence for obstruction if we don't know what the underlying crime was or wasn't i feel like that's going to be a big problem politically and legally and just like in my brain i how you know whatever charmed did or didn't do these commies firing etc
cetera
all these moments of interference depend on whether he was interfering with something that was like a significant and real or not so i just feel like that
the question of order there has been bugging well now it does this work a policeman's rushing into a house you don't know for what purpose them policeman is rushing into the house but you see him rushing and you tackle him do we need to know for the purpose of the reason he was rushing to make a claim about my obstructing him well
you don't need to i think for the purpose of making a prosecution
i don't know you may or may not need to know the reason there may be yeah think i had been certainly you would want new sure definitely will you run noon wanna know and and there's an issue i'm not sure why you need to rush into issuing a report about it and then we will and is chump that when least many no no and usually attack
caterpillar drug yes so then how come may want it now because of that but if the tackle or is tried and stop the policemen for me to see i don't really have all that incriminate ham right yes
well that's interesting yeah ok okay i know this isn't the analogy will put this debate and a minute but if i wouldn't necessarily be you would wanna know right because yes in part of this is also a not only part of it the central claim right is whether the present what was in the president's head so you need to know kind of the facts of the of the investigation mountainous
okay
so i i i i'm mystified that i share your mystery i had the same thought really wondered i was hoping you were going on my no i don't think it makes sense i'm hoping it's just wrong honestly or it reflects fact that we don't know i mean one thing about the nine investigation and i continually enjoy is that there are these parts of it
don't know about i mean that with clear the other thing i really enjoyed about the long report that we referring to early or with the information about for it and has these huge redacted sec yeah has clearly there are other people being investigated wow the people we don't know about that and connections being made so you know maybe we just chalk this up to the greater
damn of the team and we small models on the outside cannot begin to understand that strength of the or process will could very well be the president's best defender but it's also just great to see you know especially since there's so many other things in our lives where people are behaving in a way that is totally sham baltic and
against all the normal practices and rules to see somebody sort of doing the joe friday routine in a sustained and methodical way our last single point which is not really question which is emily just confirmed this is correct
going back to why mahler it you will report and if he felt he couldn't criminally in date the president the idea would be he would present something which presumably congress would get a hold of and congress could then make a decision about whether this these were grounds for impeachment or not to even if even if muller was
family and date he could present something which which would be evidence or a brief that might be part of an impeachment case is that right absolutely and that's the obvious constitutional remedy and that we have here is why the elections well there are many reasons why the november twenty right next to a members election
these are important and this is one of them
all right
slate plus members get bonus segments on the person on other sleep pod casts and we have a bonus slate plus segment few today and we're going to talk about what things that countries other countries i've just been out of the country and and when he was recently other country what are the things that other countries do that

and weird and fox driven on immigration he used the holiday weekend to go all in about a variety of immigration issues that he locked together
he threw together a group of asylum seekers a caravan of asylum seekers that they've been called making their way north from central america confided that with dhaka with catch and release with put an army troops on the border
and there seems to be public policy coming out of this classic classic trump impulse policy and then kind of on a parallel track it about the same time he has been savaging amazon and calling for perhaps a revision to and a deal than amazon has with the post office essentially because he does not like the wash
and post which is owned by the founder of amazon gift basis
oh
emily
well on immigration where does this all come from we're gonna we're going to end up with an entirely new public policy based on presidential bile and from what i can see it comes out of a mix of trumps actual own dismay of not getting funding for the border wall combined with people guess on fox and friends talking about
particular border things that they don't like combined with a story of this caravan combined with ann coulter a former ally of his really going after him on television combined with perhaps traveling tomorrow mara lago and been alone in a room with his very hard line immigration advice or stephen hill or so
is that mean that that comprehensive explanation is there more me to actually reflects some deeply held belief that he now wants to carry out and in policy for know i think it's exactly what you said it's that
turned to the base and also i fear of the base and i also think the news coverage totally changed then york times pack as the daily did a great like rundown of various news casters not just on fox talking suddenly about have the president was being strict on immigration in wanting stronger borders and he loves the idea of invoking the military
in our vast and i think it was very fact and from his point of view and that's the other explanation for like he did it the facts
certainly in that first tweet storm be damned i mean the facts of of the caravan coming because of dhaka which there was no evidence for and the fact that the caravan wasn't going to make it past the border for which there was no evidence now they're he does seem to be some evidence if you look at the border arrests that they are ups three times from where they were in march of last year
that's because of the weather
that's not a surprise if you look at the graphs of border arrest stay go up and a very very predictable time over the last many years why is this such an emergency situation it should have been one for which they had a long time to prepare and just a period of time for which they've been in office but also many
years of policy planning for hand over all border crossings are down in the united states and the ocean that there's a crisis here is psycho whipped up fake id i can't really take place i it's ninety degree angle no sense like the lowest level since nineteen seventy one area in precisely one of the things that i think it is a terrible thing that a government can do
something that authoritarian governments do and and even democratic governments do on the way to becoming an authoritarian governments are ticket or a government is to declare an emergency what is normal and i think we're seeing trump do a bit of that around immigration that it's not that they're orange prob
but it's the problems are predictable and kind of normal baseline problem and it's also not even that the solution and he's proposing is so terrible i mean george w bush than national guard troops the border present obama said national guard troops to the border
it's been done before i actually have no i'm not smart enough to know whether it's good or bad policy but if not radical policy what is radical is is to put it in emergency terms because that allows you rhetorically and then perhaps even in policy ways to to take liberties and
to impose
changes and draconian rules on people that are not good in the long term the other thing david bringing doc into a conversation about border crossings is a lamp tarnishing the dreamers and letting jump off the hook for having rescinded the order that protected them and for in my view early is blowing up the negotiations at the democrats
which would have given him the law funding that was his original ask so there's also illness you know there's all these insinuations here are you whip up people's fear of border crossings and kind of uncontrolled migration and then you also try to implicate the people who are already here with you on that has been an actual pub
sympathy
we got a letter from listener
sorry i don't have her name in front of me but she's i think a kind of liberal listener and and are questioned us was look i'm a i'm a liberal but i'm in and patriotic american and i don't think we can't have open borders we can't allow everyone who wants to come in the country
country and if we have borders we have to enforce border law we have to
make sure that people aren't getting in here illegally and benefiting so what does a generous hearted but concerned liberal like me supposed to think may be president trump is right and that we do need to to be more draconian about this what what's your response to her
well til know look open borders
very different from what we have now that they would be changing a huge earth shattering change of thousand we had there's a whole really interesting debate about whether the united states should have open borders whether they're yes it will be there be lots of population shifts that it would eventually kind of even out and couldn't the country i'm still are
you know many tens of millions more people who live here certainly we have a lot of space
the pace of that if you can totally you know you'd have to think through it could it all just sort of like work out in the end i don't know enough about all of that to have a strong opinion one way or the other however what we have now is so far away from open borders we do not let their many people in we send people back all the time
and what we're talking about doing if trump makes the legislative our policy changes he wants to is a system in which we afford even last due process to people and then we currently do and there is precious little for many many people they never have layers they get detained they spend years into
attention if they don't leave immediately
you can worry about open borders and think that you have to have an answer to that question thought through or you can say like in the reality that we live in we already protect the bard are strongly in that debate right now is whether we want to ratchet up the pressure or even further in a world in which as john sad
overall immigration level illegal immigration is down
what it was nineteen seventy one and also of course we do have job for a lot of these people they are doing jobs that wages that a lot of native born americans don't want to work for and that is like another whole part of this equation
think i mean i do think like on practical terms you want to do you want to prioritize your own to prioritize getting rid of people who are dangerous so that the people who end up staying are the people who are the hardest working and most likely to contribute to society you want to attract the brightest people you can services for students so focusing on things that that are that are
magnets for people who are likely to come and create good job and build businesses here
i do think you want to worry and this is where i think liberals have failed i think you do want to worry about pockets and ghettos and and and non english speaking areas of the country actually think that i don't think that conservatives are wrong to say that it's reasonable for people to worry about about town
and cities that change very quickly
and where the long time inhabitants
you face a whole new set of of migrants and that change the culture of those cities i think it's a perfectly legitimate thing for people to worry about the country should be concerned about
so that's what i would say
let's turn now to the other target briefly of president trumps i heard this week which is amazon so he has been savaged gene amazon as he has previously savaged c n n and in fact possibly even derailed the eighteenth tee time warner merger because at his attacks on cnn
and now he's going after amazon and alleging there's amazon's getting
unfair but beneath us and treatment from the post office is part of its package delivery deal with the post office
and clearly the only reason he's doing this is because he doesn't like what the washington post is writing about him and he's he is displacing has anger on the washington post on to just be those the founder of amazon he's hoping to get you use this pressure on basis perhaps to change the coverage in in the post which is terrifying
that is dictatorship one on one you get the media class to do your bidding by threatening their pocketbooks
basis so far seem unfazed but man i do not like this
no don't like it at all but also and also i think you can add a second to that which is that it used to be the case bad
conserve is particularly and republicans criticized the interference by president and the private market full stop period for whatever reason is now the president has already this president has already done a number of things picking various companies and putting his finger on them for various reasons based on his view of economic
but in this case it's based on his specific this goes in this isn't a new category and so there is a philosophical reason for why even the president allies should be alarmed by this in addition to the underlying first amendment
reasons you should be alarmed by he had the other thing is it's just so on
too bad thing for us to have to wonder about whether that you know eighteen team merger is being prevented for because the president doesn't like the news coverage and cnn and we should be able to trust the government to be looking into a very complicated questions
about anti trust and let our emerge are while create a monopoly are a threat of a monopoly without the fear that this is all being influenced by the fact that president doesn't like the way cnn is reporting on hand and the fact that congress is allowing this that they're you know it's sort of like alarm from people like us them
people in the media world and you know plenty of well meaning commentators out there but there's no consequences for champ in doing this and the more non like gaffes the worse it is for the country
right and the flip side of the think claire
conservative broadcasting network which is rolling up tv stations around the country and it's getting really have no look see from regulators about it
possibly possibly because at the outlet for president all propaganda for conservative propaganda and propaganda as a strong word but i think you could and it may be that that that's allowing it a regulators are not paid much attention in a presidency that's really rife with corruption and insurgents rife with corruption we have a president and a family that
getting rich at the trough for expanding their businesses and the way that jared kushner seems to be where you have people like wilbur ross possibly benefiting from work that they're doing and government and certainly advisors what's his name the lead advisor i've forgotten man who was getting rich and you have then penny ante corrupt
one of the sort that scott pruitt and tom price this is a kind of parallel which is the the belief that present of can use his public office is public power to exact private revenge using the power the presidency to do it and that's as bad as getting rich off of it it's a form of corruption at the highest order
an hour
the possibility that he is chilling negative media coverage and making it even more likely that cnn will cover alive his next rally in a sling stay on which they did again recently and then when you think about sinclair kind of rising alongside fox and having another right wing tilting
on television network with a lot of info and that is changing our media landscape and away and that may have real political implications and at all is just kind of happening right in front of my and sinclair is is seeking to buy a part of her strain which would give at seventy two percent control of the market so there is a
there's a space in which the federal government will have to rule is a are in the eighteenth tee time warner case about consolidation and where you could imagine
sinclair getting favorable treatment if this narrative plays out
the narrative that says basically sinclair as incentive eyes to do the president's bidding or at least do things that make him that please him because they basically want that deal to go through and not have a government get in the way
approximately every two hours one pennsylvania and downs and the two uncles and these enough to muslims
tuned
every second counts
see the life
monks
box of the night
people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars if you're donald trump how do you solve a problem mike scott pru it scott pruitt has become an ethical headache that's a funny term that's funny term for this administration but even by the gambino family standards of corruption that characterized as administration pruitt is starting to stand out for is gross
behavior
whole series of stories really lay down and gushing that just doesn't seem to stop so there's the fact that he until recently had been getting an extremely sweetheart deal and as washington a combination to paid fifty dollars a night so that he and his daughter could live at a fancy condo one block from the capital
which is just not market rate for those folks who are thinking admitted to watch not going a fifty dollar a night hotel by the way in the dc area what would your room look at home
yeah imagine otero so of course that was from the wife of a lobbyist
top energy lobbyists to is seeking a pipeline deal that indeed was approved by proves he has also spent a huge amount of money on his own security he spent a ton of his office with for bugs to a sound proof phone booth installed he has twenty four hour security security he's which maybe thirty people and
many at least two million dollars a year on he sought although didn't follow through on renting himself a private jet for one hundred thousand dollars a month
he also this week it turned out used a provision of the safe drinking water act the only provision of the safe drinking water act he seems to care about he used to give to of his young aids a huge raise after the white house said he couldn't give it a raise under normal circumstances he was like well i'll just use this obscure provision to give people
a higher salary
yet of course skype heard it a policy dream i think it is hard to argue if you're a trumpets probably the most effective of trumps cabinet numbers are doing what trumped and conservatives want he has just announced that with a clean water act he's going to make all decisions about the clean water act and presumably it's going to side with him
industry more he's he's limiting the use of science essentially in making determinations about things he's limiting the discussion of climate change in a role of climate change in any decision making maybe this week he announced that the administration's zero a rollback higher mile per gallon standards that the obama administration put on car
lawmakers to he's doing great actually
i forgot one example of cruelty and grotesque which is just the most amazing one he forbid staffers from taking notes and meetings with him presumably because he wants no record no record that people can say is accurate of things that he says
he is projected a ban on a pesticide that link to nervous system damage and children he
is repealed a rule that gave me a p a broader authority over water pollution he's done a really good job in doing the bidding of of energy industry and other industries in ways that a lot of conservatives and term supporters like the all of that stuff which you might violently disagree with on them on
policy grounds easy at least connected with there are no surprises there right that's what donald trump was elected to do and if people don't like that then they should elect somebody else but but the first set of things you put your finger on is exactly the opposite of what donald trump was elected to do the president repeatedly on the campaign trail in concert
campaign trail and then and in his inaugural address he talked about the people who'd come to washington to benefit themselves at the cost of the forgotten man and woman when you give the staffers raises which as ed henry of fox news pointed out in a in a very pressing interview of pruitt the raised was larger than the median
income of of americans mean this wasn't just a tiny little cost of living raises these were big raises for for people or twenty six year old and a third home with i am from atlanta yeah so i think that's what sort of takes this i think to another level
now at least got to republican members of congress who have called for him to step down because of know on the grounds of course stewardship of federal funds
emily
david and know the a secretary returned to earth secretary who a minor league graft her like a thing the labour to learn both in for free and equipped to up though he has been ousted and pruitt is still there what's the difference while i'm in a crane to sulk and media to our after he was fine
tired he was trying to prevent that from being privatizing so he was not on board for that tramp policy agenda that seems like a crucial difference here and you know from the point of view of the champ white house for all the reasons you both gave pru it is doing what he was put there to do
he's an acting the policy changes you know changing the pay lots of career people the are leaving are in despair and not like blood trump one it and so you have this conflict between these policy achievements and success and this corruption which makes the administration look
terrible and then the other thing is they have a problem who are they going to put in there to replace scott pruitt who they can confirm who is going to continue the quite effective policy mark that he has been on but you know the corruption is just so much a theme of this administration and they wonder if either of you have a theory about it i mean i don't really get it
some of it seems so small bore and i mean how much money did it really save with this deal from this lobbyist i mean i guess tens of thousands of dollars is the answer to that he has someone who supposedly had presidential aspirations and wanted to replace jeff sessions as attorney general why would it have been worth it
pam and the only thing about the fancy travel on the private chat and like the super expensive sound booth i mean is there something just bitching about the trappings of government for these people were it's like here's what you get to do here is the sort of
sure add that like the american federal government has to offer i fear i had of one of these agencies you get to kind of wrap yourself in this cloak of having a huge security detail that's another strange to me part of the pruitt story anyway i just wonder what you guys think is going on here as there's just something that makes
people who are drawn to chomp prone to drifting is that just like kind of part of the dna of the administration show your noodle and off his and somebody in your staff and it's kind of hectic dick and you know you work for a disorder
chief executive which has to say the president and one of them hurly burly one of your aid says oh you know as treasury secretary you're allowed to fly military aircraft and so you say i and so you just don't follow up now so that's the way in which you don't necessarily need to be a drifter and hard but you don't do the extra double checking
of wait a minute are you sure that's right to i think prude it's clear that pruitt is benefiting from the overwhelming volume of stories about corruption the sheer number of stories about penny ante drifting in this administration when one person has a criminal it's a problem for that person when everyone's a criminal the problem for society and
i assume with this that as long as there's not another round of these stories in the next week this what kind of all subside as an entertainer and how long does it sustain itself is a new story to i am just in order to be safe i'm just checking the news for the is not to fire wall we've been taken it's like know he seems
at least as of today so let's leave it there

john dickerson you're looking back at your old atari youth advisory board memorabilia with the
nice drink brown liquor and hand thinking back on those old days of playing did gergen ms pac man
what would you be chattering and the t to mrs the english game to mr stickers and it will be the only one company me definitely
she will not be listening as exactly
so my chatter is about the story of of one nick virtual he was a naval reserve us from nova scotia this comes from peace and boring boring by the way and he was in british columbia for a work related conference seventeen years ago he was at the fairmont hotel
which is very pricey highfalutin joint and he had brought his fellow reservists friends he brought them some pepperoni sticks which are much loved
from these pepperoni and sticks from nova scotia the he didn't want them to get spoiled and so he opened the window of his room so that the cool air from outside could could keep them in pristine condition i can't wait to see where the healing slow
he then went out for a four to five hour walk and this is what he returned to upon entering the room
can i guess i guess coming up
sure no i think you can guess reckons a years how he recounted nick said i remember walking down the long haul and opening the door to my room to find an entire flock of seagulls in my room
i didn't have time to count but there must have been forty of them and they had been in my room eating pepperoni for a long time he then discovered it seems to me to be an axiomatic point but anyway he discovered that spicy pepperoni does not agree with the sea goals digestive tract and so they had been while he was out on his walk
covering the room in guano
as they reacted to his pepperoni he then entered the room which i suppose because he's a reservist he's he's condition to go into dangerous environments anyway in order to try to affect repair upon situation and in doing so cause the birds to lose whatever remaining guano that day
had because frankly a day were freaking out that there was a dude in the room
he wrote that the resulting chaos was a tornado of seagull excrement feathers pepperoni chunks in fairly large birds whipping around the room
anyway at one point he tried to get a burnt out the window by throwing a shoe added he went out the window and nearly bring somebody on the on the ground below the reason going bowling was writing about this is that seventeen years after the incident
nick was finally allowed back into the fairmont emperors hotel which had banned him as a result of this as a result of this event and his inducement to get them to allow him to return was that he gave them a pound of chris brothers pepperoni which was i think the offending pepperoni and the original case often
emily what does your chatter i have been thinking a lot as i and many other people have been doing about martin luther king this week it's the fiftieth anniversary of his assassination and memphis and and if you want to just like read intellectual material that his legacy i recommend when there's been so much good writing that i really
and the staff man newkirk has been raining in the atlantic i want to actually recommend a book that i read this week that it just was so special and excellent it's called reading with patrick it's by and michelle cool oh and it's a book about michelle's experience she was a teacher and the mississippi delta es un
she went there with teach for america and we sort of
have a stereotypical notion and how that story goes but that's not michelle story her story is about leaving the downturn and learning that one of her former students had been arrested for killing someone and returning to the delta just essentially to be with him he was in jail and she laughs
wound up spending a great deal of time with han in jail kind of going back to their teacher student role but also moving into a of and it really is like the books called reading with patrick because it's about her discovery of poetry and other literature that they're reading together and he write some just
amazingly beautiful things himself that are included in the buck and probably it's most powerful passages that i had just learned to read this little bit the michelle rates about herself and she is trying to decide about whether to return to the delta or not and at the time she had graduated from law school and she's like wrestling with decision and she rates and then you laughed
you justified and you're leaving by saying you want to learn the law because it was a powerful language to now and perhaps you could make some broader change that maybe you forgotten the language you started to learn in the delta the one that allows you to connect with people from different circumstances this is a powerful language to and maybe you forgotten it maybe this is the only language that matter
it's not shameful to be motivated by the feeling of being needed don't block out your desire to feel a part of what is raw and vital just don't think this really spoke to me i for reasons and my own life of feeling more and more like these personal connections be make a cross boundaries of race and class are the most important things
the things that change our own world view the most just wake us up to human potential but also like to our own
the limitations of our own world and it's hard to do this kind of connecting you make a lot of mistakes along the way and this book is full of michelle cools insight and reflections about that and i just really took it to heart and recommend it
tom's rude
charter briefly
the washroom in portland or mention that i was was during a bracket around the most valuable mundane invention and history and just to update those who were interested in how that turned out the finals turned out to be sewer vs paper kind of predicted that way yeah that's right our audience voted sewer
