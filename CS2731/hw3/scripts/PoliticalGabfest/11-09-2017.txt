democrats had their first good night and a year on tuesday with democratic candidate whopping republicans in the few odd year election races that take place around the country
notably film murphy easily took back the new jersey governor seat by crushing chris christie's former lieutenant governor that was kind of gimme feel like you could have run a bag of rag and it would have beaten the republican that state and more notably virginia surged incredibly hard for them
regrets ralph northam crushed republican ed gillespie to become the next governor democrats may have flipped of many a seventeen of the hundred seats in the house of delegates and which would recapture majority and house of delegates they were they had only thirty four seats before the election they may have as many as fifty one hundred and fifty two by the time the recounts are done
and that also included the election of the first trans gender official to a state legislature danica rome
it was elected to the house of delegates and beginner there were also wins in unlikely places and georgia and mayoral races in new hampshire
washington state the state legislatures following draw the democrats essentially almost anywhere a democrat could win on tuesday night they did win so how big a deal was tuesday john it's an off year election
i think it was a really big deal because of all because the sweeping nature that victory that you talked about
so it's a big deal just period anytime you get that kind of a clear signal across many different races it's a big deal you don't have to do as much back bending to convince yourself that it has ramifications for other races or for the shape of politics when you have that kind of consistent signal coming in different places so that's a big deal just in terms
of our current political moment for democrats it's a particularly big deal because they just spent the last week
padding this internal really dead end
feeling fight about twenty six sixteen race just a very backwards looking fight
kicked off in part by or maybe entirely by donna brazil's book and so what this ratified for democrats was too big things one that really biggest thing which is that an off year elections were democratic voters don't usually turn out the question was would the antipathy towards donald trump which became a value
opposition in other words it's just i don't i don't like his policies it's i object to him at the very core of who i am and who identify myself as was that going to be something that would motivate democrats to go out and vote so that they can overcome their traditional off your issues the answer to that appears to very much beat yes and it appears to be
yes across the entire democratic constituency so millennial voters voters of color and edge college educated voters in the virginia race
democrats had one between forty two forty five percent of college educated whites in each of their victories in the states so that's obama in twelve mcauliffe and thirteen warner and fourteen in inclement sixteen so that's forty two and forty thought northam got fifty one percent of college educated whites so that is a
signal that the democratic party coalition does respond to and north and was not a
you was a kind of bland candidate had some stumbles which makes the signal seem even stronger and then finally and i'll just shut up but finally sent signals to republicans running and we can talk about those but i'll shut up now
there to interpretations from the point of view of the republicans have tuesday night one is dead trump is in without trump is not going to work outside of deep red states that it's become too toxic and another is that glass be lost by not fully embracing down on top and that of
i suppose trumps own spin on and steve and has been like all over the airwaves everywhere saying that gillespie was a creature of the spawn that his past is is very mainstream can it meant that his efforts to embrace some of trumps immigration and speeding that's not have banned him but that's how i'd put it that that didn't work because
people didn't see it as sincere and of course he didn't glass be didn't campaign with trump so which of those clearly ban in and trump are pushing back against the first narrative which is everywhere it does seem crazy to me though that gillespie did seem fake to people that he wouldn't be able to galvanize the tramp
and the same way as a candidate and you know who really lake drinks from the down on champ gordon and thought said and then i wonder as well but would that can be able to win and win in a swing state anyway i mean is the problem here for people like chump and ban and that this turns out to be a relatively
a narrow way of attracting about because virginia almost nominated a trumpet
that's a person and corey stewart who is the person who collects be beat in the republican primary i don't think i think you'd be hard pressed to say that stewart would have outperformed gillespie and with election i think stewart would have would have done even worse so i think it's a very hard trick to pull off in states that aren't deep breath
anyway but i hope for the sake of
trumps defeat that term continues to push this and and republicans are stupid enough to keep trying to do it
well i think that the north and victory was so big i think your point is right david which is even if the more ban and like candidate had been story to have been unable to win the primary could he have made up that massive deficit and that deficit was created because of this antipathy towards present
trap which presumably a corey stewart candidate would have exacerbated because he would have brought the president into the state
so i don't think that that theory holds but the fact that there is an ongoing debate
about this means that the signal sent to all other republicans running is very unclear and so what where do you go what do you do if you're a republican in are in a state where things are up for the grads or of your house member in a suburban district where the suburban vote just came out in force against donald trump
one of the interesting things about thurber generate again that
gillespie and republicans performed extremely well in rural and white areas they over performed in rural areas and southwestern virginia and particular republican candidates incredibly well and so just to dig into that question john with an electorate this divided what is it that state
ten minutes are going to have to do in states which are relatively purple and estate like a misery
i am not and i think in in in alabama or mississippi this is not that much of an issue because that's going to be interesting to see this ryan learn race may that anyway and have clashed so
yeah that's the question because again if if gillespie did well in the rural areas if he did well in traditional trump areas than a more trump trump candidate is not gonna do you can only get so much of the election out of those areas
and so what you are flirting with here if this is true is the idea that politics is reverting to what some people would say it would be reverting to form which is that there is not enough of a trump coalition to defeat the rise of the democratic ah
coalition that what happened in twenty sixteen was that basically donald trump
goose is turn out as high as it probably could go and he ran against a very weak canada so the conditions are now different now again as you point out what do you do in misery
it is a constant question every day for her candidates do they what are they going to do relative to donald trump and if you're democrats the reason you like that is that your message actually quite clean which is you make it about donald trump and donald trump wants to make it about donald trump whereas if you're a republican you want to try and make it a local race with enough donald trump
you are able to turn out his base emily one of the hardening things i think for anybody watching this left right center is that there was a series of new candidates drawn into politics as the way you want to happen with that people who are galvanized by the electorate twenty six and decided to enter politics and run races and i think i saw a statistic that thirty one
people who had been drawn in by anti trap activism ended up running and winning on tuesday
pretty significant number among the democratic victory there's a tremendous amount of diversity a lot of first time women can get a room the first trans gender
state elected official or burger
in the state legislature there is a sikh mayor elected in hoboken
what does that tell us about the both the diversity the democratic coalition but also this new involvement and politics
i mean it's heartening if you are part of the resistance or just part of either party in a moment as cemented change the sense that like new people will come in with their energy and decided to enter politics one of the problems in the last decade or sell has been our fear that political life has become
so unpleasant and unforgiving bag that people aren't gonna one or up their sleeves and become can that sell now he has like on some democrats are really good response to that and presumably it will be galvanizing from two thousand and eighteen many other thing is it looks to me like the future in the sense that turn up
was up with millennium goals and millenniums are going to overtake boomers and as a proportion of the electorate by i think like either twenty twenty or twenty twenty two and so there's just a shift happening hero an openness to lots of different kinds of people and not in this sort of bluest parts of the country
me either and that's i mean that's just gotta be a helpful thing in terms of like the polyglot open nature of the country what john do you make of the
victory to there were some victories in state legislature cheats in georgia
trump be district in michigan went to democrats the medicaid expansion in maine when strongly strongly endorsed by voters
the mayoral election and what with a new hampshire town or a couple of florida mayoral election went to democrats why and relatively republican areas or trumpet areas
do you think this this happened
well
i want to be real careful about
drink too broad a conclusion because i haven't actually looked into all you know what happened in the manchester year's race that
that worked here but i think the signal that get sent from all those different disparate places the one unifying theme is the leader of the opposite party has a thirty seven point five percent approval rating and that as you pointed out when you mention the thirty one people who won who have just entered politics is a part of the trump resistance the end
energy and the system that has led to these results wasn't just turn out energy on election day that there are things that president trump put in motion and we see some of the other big forms in politics moving as well that are a reaction to his presidency so many more democrats running for office is all up and
down the ballot as an active opposition to the president and also just re revitalization of their own feelings about a certain brand of politics because the way the country is split now
oh all this stuff goes to you know
a reaffirmation of a very different kind of world view and when you have a stark alternative like the president it excites those who have a different world view
to go and fight for what they believe in so all their energy doesn't have to be in opposition of the president is just it's the president makes them want to get out and fight for what they believe in and so that gets candidates it gets people excited and energized well before election day and the president is in a sense under this
theory providing with each new tweet turn out mechanisms for those people who have who feel this opposition to him so that would be my first cut it this just based on the disparate nature of those outcomes and you have in maine an interesting thing developing which that the governor le page said
says that he might not basically listen to the will of the voters on the medicaid expansion which is nuts and can i say when my thing about that to attend and still you know now it seems like oh it was so obvious that route from someone is going to when he won by nine points like foregone conclusion that last week it seemed like the polls are all over the place like
who knew and one thing i was really wondering about was whether all of the efforts to turn out on north some voters were going to also turn out less be supporters that you know if you see the other team gearing up and practicing extra hard for the big game like you respond and do that too and that doesn't
seemed to have worked i do have happened and i think that's really interesting it suggests that the trunk
turn out push for its own base is not like and as easy a button to push just to build on that and we we have to be humble about what election exit polls tell us especially since there's a new reporting i'm thinking from center for american progress on the size of the white working class
vote in the twenty sixteen election that's quite different than the exit polls but having said that on this question of trump islam versus president trump gillespie obviously ran that at about thirteen played on fears about immigrants and crime in what seemed to be right out of the trump playbook in the eggs
suppose it showed that only twelve percent of the electorate was moved by that issue or cared about that issue or voted based on that issue not surprisingly collapse be one that group overwhelmingly but only twelve percent so if you look at the issue that motivated north and voters thirty nine percent said healthcare was the number one issue and he one man by a gargantuan
margins so the point here is the reason you run on these red meat hot button social issue type or cultural issues is to increase that share to a large enough portion of the electorate so that you can take advantage of your existing advantage in that topic area and the fact that only twelve percent cared about the immigration question for gillespie means
it's not a push button type thing or that all you're doing is exciting or base you're not pulling in people to vote on that which is what people when they were criticizing north them at the end they were saying oh he came out and said he would not support sanctuary cities he's really you know he must be on the run on this issue glass piece you know put him on the defensive which sub
did a larger portion of the electorate was going to base their vote or base they're feeling about him in some measure on this question about crime and and immigration
there was one quite demoralizing aspect of tuesday night for democrats which was that democrats dominated the election in virginia
and i think north american went by nine points they are going to either to have half the legislature or maybe a one seat majority in the state legislature and the reason for this is the the distribution of oats is not fair but essentially because virginia is a gerrymandered state in the state legislative districts are gerrymandered to be the democrats
one many more votes they're not can end up with much more representation in the legislature this is lost because they're getting back sixteen or seventeen seats so it seems like a huge win but given the scale of libertarian they actually are to control a clear majority of that legislature emily
my fear about this election is that supreme court justice anthony kennedy is going to look at it and say look the voters want to the ballot box they flip the virginia legislature why do we need these kind of gerrymandering interventions that the people in wisconsin are proposing the system is working voters are turning out there galvanized and
and they foot the legislature even though the legislature should have been flipped much more than than it may end up being laid except the last thing he said is so important and relatively easy to see that i think let's give justice candy some credit and it's clark sinclair hit because you know look when you i was looking
this last night when you look at some of the task for measuring the degree of gerrymandering in particular the efficiency gap that has gotten attention in wisconsin case which is run by the supreme court the virginia house of delegates scores super high it has a big efficiency gap which means that on the votes then distributed in the way you say
say to give republicans a big advantage and so the second sentence is also what you said which is that even in a way of election the democrats are barely taking control or they're not going to have control and that's exactly the same kind of scenario we've seen play out in the last three elections in content since
twenty eleven gerrymandering bear the problem is we don't have any kind of right for proportional representation in the constitution and the supreme court has made it clear in the past they don't think that a simple measure a proportional representation is what the constitution guarantees however if you see a scenario in which in election as
after election a party in trenches itself and the other party even in a wave election can't easily take back control that seems like exactly the kind of problem the supreme court should allow lower courts to referee is they're going to open the door to a claim for political gerrymandering on which you know today
haven't had those kinds of court rulings that have actually allowed that kind of claim to win one final question john the impact of the election on mode tax bill that is now been considered a mouse and senate
so one theory use this makes it harder built a pass because suburban house members from particularly from california and new york new jersey are going to be terrified of doing something which could hurt their constituents which which some of the theory is that this topic though it really hurts certain kinds of voters a moose
areas theory number two is this is just lights a fire under republicans and the house intended to do something anything that looks like legislative action so that they appear to be not simply intransigent do nothings which theory you subscribe to well i think because of the diversity of representation i think both can be true so
again you have you have more fanaticism in the system
you have on the one hand the leaders and everybody's saying we gotta do this we gonna do this so that we can when people say try and tie donald trump to our candidates we can say look i vote with him when i support him and i don't when i don't and i got you a tax cut
they can't say that second part then they've got nothing to give their supporters and they don't have a very good answer for those who are disappointed with the president for whatever reason but i think if you're in a suburban district it was going to life was gonna be tough anyway and there are other bad votes as a part of this tax bill as well in other words it's the one that's a tough vote
for anybody in a in one of those high tech states
that's one problem that the other is that you know if you ever talked about the debt and deficit as a candidate this has huge impacts their though distribution tables for middle class tax cuts depending on which version you believe the promise that everybody's going to get a middle class tax cut is not
true for certain people and so there's other bad stuff about this so i think this makes it harder and finally because the president wants a win because everybody's telling everybody saying that this was a huge rebuke to him
he's going to start putting his foot on the gas and we have not yet seen and legislative event where more of his attention has improved the prospects for the legislation

it is three hundred and sixty six days and selection twenty sixteen one of the most surprising days and our collective lifetime
in my own remembered life there are three days that fundamentally change and experience the world one was december second two thousand which was when my first child was born the other was nine eleven and the third was at least so far was trumps victory another brave twenty sixteen i went to bed
that night i remember very very anxious and depressed
but partly because of temperament and partly because of the unearned luxury of being healthy and white and prosperous i woke up and told myself well it will not be that bad it's not going to be back bad
so a year later is it that bad
what has gone better or worse than expected
is the country or the whole better or worse off than we expected it would be year ago
emily
how do you feel i obviously i think if i know you you think the country is worse off than it was a year ago but has it worse off than you expected it would be all not at war and the economy is humming along so those are like really important basic fundamentals for at the country right
i mean anything if you were some are you worried that down champ is going to blow through a lot of the norms of government and give us like serious rattling to some basics of our constitutional structure of that stuff has happened on a daily basis in a way that you know it's very hard to give a necessity
attention to you however you know in my you the thing that has like got me the most agitated probably the most one of the things has been like concerned about the basics of the rule of law holding and on the idea that the president is subject to the lawn that the mahler investigation is going to be
glad to proceed and that has continued rate of mean tampa's on rattled the saber at mahler there's been talk of firing him at various points into an enraged jeff sessions are accusing himself and the investigation and sessions and sad that he regrets having done that by sessions did and he's still there
yeah i mean maybe only because trump wouldn't be able to figure out how to get a new attorney general confirmed and and now but as long as that stays there i feel a really important kind of basic part of our constitutional structure as it's evolved especially since on that nixon investigations and nixon's resignation that has held
and i think is you know it's really important we need to keep watching it but as long as that's in place i guess my deepest fears about the toppling of you know really important structure all aspects of the government have not been realized
don't forget i'm just a that there's a whole other one which emerged yesterday which was the thought that the president to the jury may be pressuring a t and t to get rid of cnn as part of the approval of any deal for eighteen to to purchase time warner which is yes a fairly other another kind of
violation of a norm and and intervention in process that is fairly shocking if true we don't know if it's true may now be true yeah and it's a complicated i just don't know enough about that merger and how other administrations might have been expected to respond to it in the world of anti trust i just haven't read enough about it
yet but yeah me and on its face that could be like one more serious mark what will we'll see i mean with all this like it's still pretty early on and there's also such a gap between what the president says and tweets which is like really norm bass staying and corrosive to the rule of law at
on and then to some degree what he actually dies at least in the rom we've just been talking about the only thing i think is really important to bring up here is that while congress has not yet past a major piece of legislation
in the kind of trump agenda given the amount of health care we don't know what's going to happen with taxes it is still true that some of the federal agencies are marching on and doing like serious work i mean the claim that trump really has accomplished a lot is true if you are looking at it through the lens of the air the department of homeland security
or department of education there's just a lot of regulatory success for the trump administration
john what's your coat on in what ways do you think the country different when off and you expected it was going to be back
i would have expected at least some simulation in the market
some people see the success of the jobs numbers and the stock market and say well of course they don't you know they like the fact that is slashing regulations and wants a big tax cuts for corporations and what's not to like but businesses are kind of risk averse and saber rattling with north korea
and just the unpredictability of the trunk presidency i thought would have had their would have been some moment where you would have had some economic moment of jitters just for the fact that the president is by his own admission sowing chaos in order to achieve what he wants so the fact that there was no sir
no other than really constant basically approving signals from the market now even if you argue and you have a strong case to that the economy is essentially are moving along on the trajectory that it was on at the end of the obama administration the fact that the despite the incredibly negative coverage and the fat
that is approval ratings at thirty seven point five and all the other things that donald trump has done hasn't gotten in the way of that trajectory is surprising for me i think you could argue based on longer time out with the democrats that donald trump is an odyssey you don't want to take this too far but he has rig reinvigorated the democratic party
in a way that is obviously quite robust now there are a lot of arguments still to be hashed out in the democratic party but they'll be hashed out regardless
and then the final thing i guess i would say is that the real challenge
and this is touching on my chatter a little bit but there's a professor paul light new york university who has studied the kind of failures of government over the course of time and going through back to the ocean
obama years and the challenge and our government has been not just the failures in decisions that presidents have made but the failures of omission the failures to put policies in place the deal with long term challenges and francis fukuyama has this idea of utah accuracy where them the minority can basically veto any action
on anything to fort the progress on the left or right
solving that break in government and solving the partisanship that locks up congress and makes it a week shell of what the framers wanted is a long term project that people gotta get started working on we're nowhere near that happening and every day that that doesn't happen every day that doesn't get improved
as a day that long term problems are not being addressed and by addressed i don't mean your preferred solution i mean that it's even being talked about her having the conversation is happening or that somebody is putting forward legislation that might have a chance of going through and becoming something and the number of government failures according to lights research has increased
over time because of this lack of for thought
even my government standards that's not getting any better
as i say every day as a day that problems can grow yeah i want to dig into bed just and my answer to this questions well which is that too i've been surprised how completely incompetent both he and his people turned out to be the level of chaos and lack of foresight is pretty astonishing
and i think one of the results of that is that they're further discrediting the idea of government has an effect of actor so the bureaucracies crippled received it from the state department which basically doesn't have anybody working there the best people have been to it and out the duties of government pretty performed poorly
i'm similarly surprised at how incredibly in effect of congress has been it its job
astonishingly poor congress has been doing anything so some of it is the failure to pass a healthcare bill but russia investigations have been placid every legislative element that have come up has been mishandled i think we're headed for another december funding crisis if i remember correctly because of the botched
that and the combination of the trump trump in incompetence
and congressional latitude as i think brings us back to the problem the jonathan roush has been so good about way now
which is it we're increasing the number of people in this country who have no faith and no belief and justifiably so themes that government can do anything and that politics is is a legitimate profession that can accomplish anything and we have accelerated part of this is norm busting that you identify anyway
that part of it is just a general sense that politics
is not legitimate it's not whole thing that people should do it doesn't work trump himself both preaches that and then he practices it and he is exaggerated they increased it and then there's actually just a at that point i think there's another element which is that there's this huge amount of presidential and corruption and also corruption within the administration
you've seen as amazing stuff with wilbur ross the secretary of commerce who apparently has been doing all these chipping deals even if he's been secretary of commerce as well line about how much money has but there's no one's been held to account about any of that stuff either and so there's there's also the sense that the system isn't even effective it self policing and can hold the president or his people to account for their
wrong doing if their lives and so to me that what's so demoralizing about the past year is not necessarily that the policy i mean i think the policies pursued have been policies i disagree with but like that's their right as the administration to do that too that's fine and the fact that the country has gone to war
good i'd like that and that the economy has a crater but this degradation of politics and political action has been incredibly worried and john i think that polite example he decided to sort of the evidence you just cited there's is reinforces that which is that politics become incapable of addressing and solving problems and trunk of success
and yet when you know you think about the conversation we just had a doubt that of reinvigoration as democrats or anyone who feels like they want to address this and politics it does seem like the system allows response to have that's right that like you can become more cynical
and turn off or you can like roll up your sleeves and their spend a lot of sleeve rolling out in the last year
although and i'm look i'm glad i'm glad to see wrote northam elected governor
you know i have friends who were running for office know there people i admire and respect thankful they maybe took a job but i continue to be sort of surprised by the lack of a cogent democratic plan that isn't
trump i don't see what it is i see that people are excited they're they're glad to be part of the resistance and they are running but i don't know i don't see what the affirmative messages that that's coming out of the left that of now galvanized by politics just seems to be not trump i think that's fair i mean there some
you can see some of that to be psych our healthcare single pair verses that kind of medicaid expansion bell that we saw succeed in mean this week like a specific issues but i don't think that you're seeing get like a really hammered out message about addressing inequality and that kind of social
y'all optimistic kinds of messaging that the democrats presumably mean but that feel like they're real era than like stronger together and some of the other saga and from the clinton administration that fell at least to me like death out flat john why do you think
for improving his his acceptance speech of his victory speech on election i talked about been president for everyone come together as one united people why didn't they bother why is no one bothered i mean that's one the other things so troubling and sad about last year's how much more device
edit the country feels
it's true one thing that we're we're witnessing at the moment is our first
well on and off its first but let's take the the dodge that we use in these instances which is the first in the modern era where you have a president who is
who is purely partisan president the rise of partisan politics and the presidency has been increasing since nineteen eighty for a variety of reasons but the idea of the president who could build a coalition for members of both parties kind of fly above the party
fights to build a coalition and pass legislation has been declining it is now
the president has only in a couple of instances even nodded towards the rhetorical idea of all let's all come together and we used to be the president's would nod to that all the time and then do what they want it now he doesn't even nod to it
and i think that what this is it's the next step in
vast part isn't split that we see that is both creates our political structure in congress and the white house and then is fed by but we now have on the pew research work that came out in october we now have the largest partisan split on a series of ten issues that they have measured since nineteen ninety
for so across a range of issues about ration race and justice and business and equity adjusted and
democrats and republicans are thirty six points apart
is it largest since ninety nine four they only started making eight or they started in ninety four
as a large as ever measured the largest they've ever measured and they started in nineteen eighty four so that manifests itself in many different ways the median democrat so democrats are becoming more liberal conservative republicans are becoming more conservative the median democrat and median republican are as far apart as they ever had been the views of a president you hadn't
as an hour's first year fifty six percent of democrats liked him
eight percent of democrats like donald trump now twenty three percent of republicans liked obama and his first year so you have honeymoons don't exist anymore the incentives for lawmakers of course we've talked about this a million times before but when reagan and nixon were elected half of the senators from the states they one where democrats so those democratic
senators had a reason to bargain with or make deals with the president because they knew a lot of their constituents had voted for him for president now we have a situation in which basically states vote for president and senator in the same form and so nobody wants to give a victory to the president and mitch mcconnell can say that is
his goal in life is making sure barack obama is a one term president and this will be my final point that the efforts to bridge the gap if you were a president trying to bridge the gap you would seek some common view among the electorate about kind of basic things how what's the role of government in in american life is health care of right are african americans do
advantaged by the system
on those basic questions democrats and republicans are as far apart as they ever have been and so if you're a president trying to make a bridge between the two you've got a span and even further territory then you ever had before which makes it very hard for any president to do it and say you could imagine and i think we're seeing a president basically
aside why bother
i'm just going to run it stay with my team keep my team energized follow governing strategy that's like the one the president follow to get elected and see if that successful an extension of that is a campaign and twenty eight team where you purge people from the ranks who are not at the first end of the ideological spectrum as you
to find it and so you basically try to run up at your team said it you can not have to bother with building bridges the problem with that is two fold one you can have a huge backlash like we saw on tuesday and to you create divisions in the country that are big and violent and irreconcilable and operate
not just at the national political level but in people's daily lives as this split and the exacerbation of the splits because you have to keep the splits exacerbated to try to build up your team through poking at the nfl and all kinds of other things
that creates a constant sense of kind of venom in unhappiness and that's obviously horrible for a country can i just add have made the pylon and my theory which is it
the kind of split you're talking about john and i think teams like increasingly failed to me like the right man for in a way that's alarming because once you pick a team you like to stick to your team it's geographic great i mean one of the things we're seeing else a bad as tax dollars that when you have states where you don't have members
the other party like there are no republican senators from blue states to exaggerate only slightly and so then like the republican senate tax bell is sticking it to the blue states because there's no actual cost and that senate to doing that now at that's not true and house who knows what will pass but just seen that happen that kind of like
geographic punishment is this gotta be a bad thing for us and then the other arm and to me is the failure of the media in particular the way that thoughts and other right wing news outlets i just supplying a different set of information and facts and headlines every day until a few live in a part of the country where everyone's watching
fox news you're just like walking around with a different idea about literally what is happening then people who are watching and listening to other media outlets
although it's weird about that all though emily if it even when you look at the numbers it's only forty percent
if people are are
thirty seven point five percent like this president know it's really you forty percent of people who are sort of conservatives and fall and so it's it's odd but that forty percent should still
v so able to dominate oh but go back to your gerrymandering play in a class of accomplishing of data and seems so odd
right plus the intensity of the national number may be thirty seven point five but it's all those people are participating in the process then they have an outsized influence in the electoral process because half the country's and vote
one of the things that i actually think it's it's also creeping up on us and the lowest it's been creeping up on us for years but this last year has multiplied magnified for a century the american ideal our form of government are kind of approach to free markets are moral force in debates are
growing up a strong middle class or internationalist open approach the world has been a defining mark of the united states and also been
we meet a world and we've always been able to fend off these kind of countervailing forces we fended off obviously nazis and fascism offended of communism
but i think that the rise of be technocratic authoritarian china
and countries aligned to to china is going to defeat us because we have squandered those advantages that we've had we've lost the goodwill we've lost the global faith that our political system works we've lost the trust enough as a partner and this is not all trumps doing and it's been things that have been sliding on for while we've lost belief that
we're going to be for open trade and open borders and global of them and that were reliable economic partner but trump is massively celebrated that and that's that's disturbing not just for us as americans but for the world to have the moral beacon in the centro guidepost of global policy suddenly not be there anymore
or is a problem and it does mean that china in particular is going to lead the world and a different direction and in the world structures and organization is going to be different than it has been for the last century and and probably in ways that we don't like
that's bleak
i'm all for bleak man
title can just say one of the final point is that there are a lot of people who
to put their faith in the president still have lots of faith in the president who are not the
partisan combatants that you see and social media and who think that the press and the elites are just out to get the president and if they are you know let's say that the liberal dream comes through and the president is trounced and and discredited and you know her
pray for his opponents
it's going to leave a lot of people who who had faith in him and who thought basically that the entire political the elite structure as demonstrated by the press but it with all kinds of other university professors and the special interests
all aligned to basically make it impossible for him succeed and so that only drives the split wider and and creates a lot i think a lot of dangerous reactionary forces in and in itself as well so
that worries me to no no yeah that's telling all right sir john how bleak to me
leave it there
and a bleaker spot

congress just heard from facebook google and twitter executives about their knowledge of in response to russian meddling in between sixteen election
we learned about several astonishing episodes the most amazing to me was when to imaginary groups conflicted into being by russian trolls each of which had a social media presence managed to get people out on the streets in texas for rallies in opposition to each other so
these to nonexistent groups which managed of gin up online followings got some of those people who are following them online to show up on the street and then essentially rumble with each other so the fake social media created a real conflict on another occasion another russian manufacture group managed to turn out hundreds
or possibly even thousands of people for an anti trump protest in new york city
the russian online meddling appears to have been very flexible very clever very chaotic it didn't seem to be necessarily seeking any particular and wasn't necessarily seeking trumps election
from my reading of it what it was seeking was to sow discord and mistrust and by any measure it was a fantastic success it was probably one of the most successful political campaigns and espionage campaigns and disruption campaigns in history
would be my my conclusion based on what i've read so far
what is it that we learned from the hearings about in particular what did we learn about how our big tech companies are grappling with us or not
i list is so not surprised the disappointed with this response i mean first of i do think that sending your layer and of coming or south as like a big thumbing their nose at congress and demonstrates that you're not really taking this seriously and second of all we're seeing the tech companies try to get away
with essentially as little accountability and certainly as little regulation as possible they're saying that they're looking into this that they want to have a better understanding they did hire a bunch more actual human beings to monitor their content with regard to political ads and i do think hiring human beings is like a huge
part of this when i was reporting particularly on facebook for my buck about bullying there was a huge resist stands to hiring lots of people to search through content and respond to complaints it just doesn't go with the silicon valley mentality are supposed to find a nice clean algorithm that's going to fix everything for you i don't think that this problem is one
the algorithm is going to help us with very much in fact this sort of algorithms way of paying for ads and then targeting them is is a lot of the problem here
you know to me just looks like congress has gotta step in here we have this huge domain of what enterprising that is now totally hang on a second we have this unregulated huge that of political advertising that we have no idea where it's coming from a from it get served up as if it was just regular content if it was on the
the airwaves we would never put up with this we would have a message at the end of each add at least saying where it's coming from and the idea that because it's online for this like reason google came up with having to do with character limits that has nothing to do with the modern internet it just seems like insane to me
why are you like apoplectic at the idea that there's anything congress can do why can't they regulate that
they regulate amazing what it has a ventilator bending they should literally figure out how to regulate spending on political advertising in particular by foreign agent since i mean this isn't amazing fact that the russian hit the russian intrusion into our election on facebook was paid for with rubles
that that's not obviously like they can switch dollars that next time but it is incredible that that happened at didn't raise any alarm bells and they should figure out how to have political advertising monitor i clearly identified on social media and and then how to regulate at the same as we would for for
organizing and any other forum but a lot of it
my indignation is on that was slightly mock indignation
it's a lot of this isn't political advertising that was sort of groups being organized this is like a stencil blue grass roots and that are formed black matters you as you united muslims of america or whatever you know try and over texas and and and these are kind of extensive
the grassroots organizations are not political advertising their their social organizations and is that something where is the problem that these things that are created were false is it that they were created by russians is it that they that they were on truly word lying about the origins
i don't know i don't think i don't think there's isn't political advertising no i don't think it's i think it's just so shocked disruption well great the don't give up their like a different buckets rates of the political advertising was also there and we should regulate it and then an addition what you were just talking about these like fake accounts that are
spreading dissension in texas getting people to actually like show up on both sides of ginned up protest those clearly violates face bucks terms of surface where you're supposed to like have a real name called and be who you say you are and so then it becomes a question of why does this company that claims to be policing and
exactly this area doesn't enforce its own rules trickier on twitter
yeah i used to that question emily a question for consumers to penalize the company on that basis and just take your business elsewhere or is that something where where there's any kind of government stepping in saying these year terms of service you're not living up to them and because there's a public cost to this we're going to step in
well that's a good question i mean the first option let's take our business elsewhere is one that personally i am drawn to and i've been feeling this way for years because of the work i did on bullying and the extent to which it seemed to me that facebook in particular but also twitter and these the some of these other platforms are just like really falling down on
their own claims of regulating this contact right they don't claim to be a public square or anything goes they claim to be like the shopping mall where they have their own content speech police but then they don't want to be held to the standard of the media company and so they set of like we go out of any real responsibility so yes we could take your business elsewhere
the more i suppose radical or at least like interventionist answer as the one tim wu a columbia law professor has been arguing for lately which is that these social media companies should really be treated as like public utilities proud almost like they should be run for the public benefit they should not be able to just like
reap enormous enormous profits out of advertising profits by the way and that are stripping other media outlets of their ad dollars and all wall this is going on on all of these things that are not serving the public interest i'm not saying that's going to happen anytime soon but i see why tim is making that argument there are no if a good solution it is
they are much more like utilities what happened with facebook to its own i think surprise
has become the biggest conduit of information and communication on the planet
obviously it's very happy about it but they're in denial about employer case when it burned around but the an edge of it's hard it's hard because they just want to be they just want to be what they want to be they don't want to have to be responsible for all that is go to one of their gross hypocrisy is which is like they say oh there's no evidence it adds
anything but so they say that there's no evidence he didn't you think they didn't sway the election but the same time they're telling all those people who are advertising and facebook you should really advertise on facebook because it the most effective way to reach people in the world to sort of its coca cola that wants to advertise on facebook ads on facebook are great but if it's russian troll to ago we don't think that affects people at all
they're they're totally hypocritical that yes i agree i can i add one more thing which is good the reports of like these enormous just loads of you know suspect money in particular lately from the saudis that we've learned about that are in the coffers of these companies like what do we think about had the idea that like data
want to comment on the recent like weird corruption courage and saudi arabia there's just a way in which because they're so huge there now implicated in these ways that seem quite and see us and all kinds of national and international affairs
let me go back to the arab spring
there was all kinds of social media action and social media meddling the united states and to create democratic or people forces would have been united states encouraged to create democratic activity within elections and egypt for example to the egyptian government that sure looks like meddling but surely you know american
meddling in their internal affairs
what's the difference between what that what american democratic activists were doing and twenty and eleven
and what russian
state backed actors are doing and twenty sixteen
there's not a huge distinction me one distinction obviously would be well no there's not in the russians are meddling in suffer in southern idea which is the idea of russia and so they believe that that's furthered by that meddling we would of course argue that what we were fighting for is a universal set of principles that all people should be
available to them which is freedom and liberty and sort of fighting against totalitarianism but i think there's a national security matter and this is where it gets back to facebook is that countries have to be aware that this kind of this is basically espionage that other countries that we're going to that are going to do
do it and minutes we sometimes do it with our own allies and so then the question is what role does the federal government get involved in the social media networks on those grounds and what how do they get involved and how do they retaliate and somebody suggested it was mitch mcconnell
suggested that facebook and twitter essentially be allowed to engage in or be encouraged engaged in or be used as conduits for
retaliatory attacks against the russians in the same sphere joe you know create our own destabilization of russia which i'm sure we're doing by the way through russian social media or russian facebook will always particularly weird about what mcconnell said i mean first of all like that's pretty soon star
the idea of using private companies to retaliate and that way and also mcconnell but saying at a while he was also expressing doubt about regulating political advertising or other regulation of the social media companies so it seemed like wrongheaded and two dimensions
my proposal in fact know how this would be carried out is that any post
on twitter or facebook or or even google ad you could have a feature which identified the country of origin of the person creating
register
so obviously you would like real names when you'd like real names but it least the ip address that created the thing
i'm sure maybe they get around that but i'm not until you get around that they just have like ip addresses that pain to three like antarctica or something yeah and then we know about all the fucking antarctic meddling in our election

okay well if got a cocktail chatter when you're desperately trying to come up for a solution to any russian meddling in your drink making and would have fallen what we've been shattered
i learned and the past week about this really interesting project called the graphic advocacy project founded by layer name tally j pope and what they're doing is trying to create like news graphics comic strips but other art illustrations as a way of
making it easier to understand all that complicated
legal issues that people try to sort out on their own so for example i've been trying in the last month or two to help a family in connecticut with some guardianship issue and everytime i go online and read about guardianship like i can figure it out and sort of but i'm never really sure i'm right a lot of the language is like unnecessarily comp
allocated and like also separate problem like unnecessarily antagonistic i would argue but in any case it hasn't been easy to sort out and like i don't the new went to law school at should be simpler so i just love this idea of using visual imagery as a way of just having regular people will be able to understand how things like
guardian ships are divorce or trust and we'll see
basic things in which people often end up the representing themselves and this is part of a larger movement that's gone on for decades to provide easy to use better written materials so in addition to the issue of people having to represent themselves and how to help them do that with visual materials islas arguing that it's time
time to redesign supreme court opinions that when they come down they have this syllabus at the top which is supposed to be a summary of the main points but it's just not easy to read or understand it's not clear what the different majorities the majority opinion who signed it you don't get that right at the top you don't get a really easy to scan holding
and the media is often criticized for getting tricky decisions wrong
famously with bush person score but also to a degree with one of the obama care decisions and i feel like if someone like how he just came in and redesigned the supreme court opinion we could solve that problem
right
what does you know
hi my janitors about a piece that michael lewis wrote for vanity fair on the us department of agriculture it's a wonderful thorough investigation of what the us does and it does lots of things that you might not have known or understood that it does but it is a
he and and it is a examination of what we were talking about earlier which is what exactly you're we your federal government does who the people are who are inside of it and he has these very in depth interviews with the scientists that the u s
and the guy who's the head of the food stamps program and it's written in his charming and lovely way which means are lots of little bits of sparkle along the way which are entertaining but what i like so much about it is
i like this idea in general which is that people should know where all this money is going and what because it's so pervasive the view that there's just all of this stupidity and ways in government and of course there is but there is also a huge huge group of people who toil in anonymity for their entire lives
basically the purposes of helping other people and this is just a great treatment of that and
so anyway in the most recent vanity fair by michael lewis and it's part of a series i think he's doing he's going from department to department doing this kind of deep reporting so there's more to come
to my chowder
is about a book which actually came in two thousand and eleven and probably the last person to read it
but i just happened to read because week i loved it called rob apocalypse bargain your wilson
and clearly trashy book but what it imagines is a future in which a i and the robots
run by but i become sentiment and very powerful and
the enemy of humans and the war that the robots wage against us
you know it's not familiar with him
the terminator terminator and it's ilk
but it's incredibly realistic it's very well told very well done really fun you can read it in an afternoon or two and scary scary in a way that zombies are because on but aren't real
i really recommend or apocalypse
also i recommend that you check out a pod cast played is doing and slate academy
feature three academies from extra pod cast really deep dive extra power guess they do and gentle booing and rebecca onion are doing a reconstruction

be complicated topic but probably enjoy checking out the sleep academy on reconstruction from juniper and rebecca
that's our show for today the political gave birth to produced today by dan bloom think stand tough one
