so present trump this week as usual r h our policy is to fire people on twitter so he announced on twitter that damn began his white house counsel
going to be leaving his job to fall soon as brett cabinet was confirmed
as a supreme court justice
so that was news to dom again i think he probably wasn't shocked he has a contentious relationship with his boss
but he didn't know that he was had had an end date that had been set and and he will be out of office so emily
mcgann is a really interesting figure he has played many many different roles and this white house
what does his departure signal in your mind
i think the most important things he's done so one of them is the judicial appointments and he has been one of the most important figures and getting on a very smooth operation
up and running for confirming judges to the lower courts champ has many more people through at this point than previous presidents including barack obama and then more about to have a second supreme court set of confirmation hearings for american and i think mcgann well deservedly take a lot of credit for that
that on with the federalist society that he is a part of the conservative movement and then the second most important part of the mcgann tenure is we don't know the significance of yet and that's what he said toa mahler during myers investigation and how that is going to play out for champ and so that just seems to me
like this big question mark when you go back and look at my dad's role in the administration either will turn out that he didn't tell mother anything that implicated trump in those long thirty hours which is why a champ is claiming or will turn out that he gave quite damning information either to protect himself or the institution and that will change how we view him mr
barkley have you ever have you ever spent thirty hours with someone and not telling them everything about for example every relationship you have her head as a little slow indiscreet and sets settings i don't know maybe those being interviewed by the f b i would have said scheme my nasa but also you another way to frame that question is
what topic could you talk about for thirty hours and not be really like getting into some serious stuff i mean you know and it's like if there was nothing to say wouldn't have been over in a month
a couple hours i mean that's horribly awful speculation but it does seem to me to be kind
extraordinary but can we stick on judges for just a moment
well first of all let's talk about just the firing in the way it was done
i mean so the president said later when he was asked to press conference it him is good and they had a good relationship and when you fire someone on twitter that as a self swallowing act would just say you cannot then later say oh he's a great guy you don't treat great guys that way that they learn about their own firing on twitter it just is so anyway
treat people you value and and eight yes i yeah i smell that we are finding out that began didn't know in advance like there is another version of this which is that they're on smooth enough to keep that part hidden and which of course in this administration we have no expectation of that we assume we're always going to
find out and maybe this is just too big a deal but i was like a little bit thinking wouldn't it be better for everyone to save face here and pretend that thousand announcement them again that was in on well yeah but like so many of these things and that's an interesting thought but like so many these things like the leak of a woman in the press officers name escapes me for the moment and
what she said about john mccain in people inside who when these norms are broken the norm that you let somebody know even if you're going to make the announcement ten seconds later five seconds later you'll let him know at least beforehand wait overnight
any respect for them he has other jumped does seem to be can generally allergic to firing people in real life of course the the irony given his tv like that just that he's someone who doesn't want to confront people in the moment and well he could have someone else like you did with a morose as somebody else
but it's but it's so dignified and so what were the man is your white house counsel he's a senior staffer it's just absurd it totally is and learning that has had to fire people in my life it is it's like it's a sin to to do it and some underhanded way or some way that avoids the
the directly confront hate yourself it's pathetic so there's that then the second thing is i think going back to family is good point about the judges
during the campaign began with was who weren't with own trombone and campaign was wise enough to know of two things one that down trump did not had a clean slate when it came to the question of judges and also knew that because of that clean slate he could wire it and such a way
that not only would the donald trump create a connection to the federalist society and leonard leo but that he would present a list of justices furthering that relationship between politics and the judiciary that we talked about last week and present that list of judged justices to the world get the validation then of the
federalist society and the and conservative legal scholars who would say if he picks anybody from this list were going to be in great shape that was all during the election and if we believe that that played a role in cementing a lot of people who are who were wildly about trump as i believe good which we should and as i believe then mcgann is not just some dude who knows about the
law he's a guy who helped along with mitch mcconnell in his decision on gossage helped get help a lot of people get to us about donald trump because of the specific legal thing and then just on the numbers the senate republicans have confirmed sixty judges to the courts this congress thirty three district court judges twenty six appeal pills court judges and of course
usage and probably cannot so that's quite a record and as we look at the trump administration and the disconnect between the reality show and the reality what's being done at the agency's what's not being done regulations that are being removed judges has to be maybe is arguably the greatest
johnson says success juggernaut a complex set of accomplishments for the president which don't get covered that much and they are big and real and will affect people's lives
in a really big and subsidy way even though much as a public attention is often spent on the various flaps yeah and when we that we should all think about that is that so far in the champ administration some of the biggest moments of refusing to go along with trump administration
excess have come from the judiciary and so if you imagine a judiciary transformed and really different from the one we have now you could imagine many fewer moments in which judges are resisting presidential power that's been expressed in like arbitrary
well rickety ways like without the travel ban the family separation is just played really crucial roles in those moments where we get a that's because we get back to you again the the big
an overarching issue of american politics which as we have a legislative branch that doesn't function and doesn't exercise i draw although of course for the people who are happy with those numbers that i just read to you earlier not only is the legislative branch is functioning perfectly which is to say they're shuttling these judges through really quickly and i mean
obviously you want to legislative branch in which you know all voices are heard and things are adjudicated and all that but for people who are of a
certain political view that then it's were no i don't worry i don't i think it would be hard for any any republican who actually believed in the constitution or believe me american system of government to say that the legislative branches working really well there's no regular order third committee hearing and there's no serious legislation there's no check on the press
didn't through legislation i mean it's that's
one example yeah know i know you but you know what i'm saying now right i mean what love you think of it in the longer time that the judges matter a great deal and then you only change the dynamic on when congress so and so congress family let's turn actually to an interesting story and the washington post on thursday which made the
case for that
using a game of throne metaphor which i don't dare repeat but they game of throne has met afford it
and said essentially that the the trump white house is not prepared for what will happen when if if the house was taken by democrats and in particular began his departure mean that the white house counsel's office is down it's will be down at the council but also for of the five deputy white house counsel's or
or gone so there's only one currently i'm in one deputy way have council who in place and they're about to be hit with it just us
if democrats take the house and absolute barrage a storm of records request subpoenas demands for documentation
which they're not ready for and in investigations all across the board not at all russia related their brushes a small fraction of that there's so many different particular investigations that democrats want to do and so much oversight that they want to engage in in the white house is not equipped for that
did that ring true to you and also if that happens
if the white house is not in fact prepare what what what will happen as a result
i think with these moments it's all about who comes in acts but then when you also think about the churn and the champ administration and the implications of being fired on twitter you wonder what quality of layer is gonna want this job knacks now i mean rudy giuliani has been angling for it since the beginning so as bad but you also people
like emmett flag who is president layer who i would think is i would say the least in the press
nothing off he seems to be in position for this to so if you imagine that they can get someone really competent to bring in his or her people then you feel like okay so you fill those deputy slots in their months away from congress actually changing hands if in fact that happens that's not a done deal and they have time to prepare for all of that
it's a question of like how they're going to get some one really good in there with the really good people that seems like the beta unanswered one well and also you could question whether i'm having four out of five deputy white house counsel spot spots
mt is a feature not a bug
which is to say oh we can't retreat these requests we'd lot we wish we could help but you know just so much paperwork and and they just slow walk the whole thing the i interviewed lindsey graham yesterday and his response to him again was
the president needs to hire somebody who basically this is my word on his needs to be ready to be on a war footing for when the house democrats take over and trample it seems very fired up to take exactly that a drowning everything about champ in the last few months suggests that he will be very comfortable in that little market
this question of you emily
sorry to ethically we talked to my last week you were on to whatever two weeks ago you're uncomfortable the idea that mcgann testified for thirty hours because of his ethical responsibility is to his client don't do those change now that he no longer works for the institution
that's a really good question i was more uncomfortable given his responsibilities to the institution of the white house although of course his client white house
he does that person yeah this is why nasa rather fascinated by so i mean your responsibility as as large as like ethics one or one continue after the representations how for example attorney client privilege doesn't end when you and the representation it goes like and death so a nonsense
no i don't think that ethical calculation really change for for him that doesn't mean that the practical it's like relation to an attorney client privilege doesn't
extend past death it extends to the attorneys to the attorneys not client stand the clients death does not end there it goes on there basically it's supposed to be for error i mean the the cases that are interesting that touch on this is if you know that an innocent person is in prison and then your client dies what do you do like that's only on the on that
who plays out in law school classrooms and has happened a few times in our history but now are really off topic know but i'm i'm saying to heard that
so in other words of this special counsel who's already had thirty hours of testimony with him is is not likely to get if if he follows the ethical rules of the job is not likely to get a whole new bonanza of information yeah i don't think that began leaving in strict by the buck ethical term should matter in terms of when he tells me
that doesn't mean that it won't accept that we think he already told my hands aren't l scrambled well and by simply giving them a dollar a timeline of events he may have told mahler a lot because of the shifting nature of the store but if if if a democratic house comes in and a subpoena
a subpoena demanding a set of records from the white house about
i can't think of when fortunately call them mind what are the arguments monuments that that acts or time yes
yes demand information about the present sex returns for the following reasons what happens
well they have to been they have legal obligations to fat and i'm sure the slow locking will happen because it's a good tactic but i don't think saying like we just don't have people and in it
sitting in chairs still work i mean it's supposed to be a functional white house office but i do think there's going to be a huge stand off and that who's ever there is going to be saying no no no you can't have any of these documents and forceful manner the opposite approach from the president's personal layers in the beginning of the mind there's no chance the president
will give up his tax returns without i don't know i mean without the us marshals going and seeing them
i think that's i think that's that's just right
last question here how does this affect the firing of robert robert mahler or of jeff sessions
well i think that is due to the extent that there has been this reporting that began threatened to quit if the president fired muller
then
some people think well now one of the brakes against the president's impulses is gone
and then maybe so
you know lindsey graham yesterday who is you know lots of people think lindsay has gone to the dark side but he basically said if the only way the president can get his way out of muller is if muller exonerates him so he said basically of getting of began as a way to fire muller
that will be catastrophic for the for the white house doesn't mean the president will do it won't isn't trying to do that but there are some voices who have been sympathetic to the president who think that would be
a big mistake
that actually doing i mean leaving the answer to that is well he hasn't been totally pushed to the wall he gets so we don't know but like he is as this all republicans in congress now that could or unhappy shine is now
super that's a very good point
we've seen a lot of talk basically about lines that shouldn't be crossed or whatever and but that's all
and don't i know that's that's a super good point
that's that's going yeah i think sessions
this doesn't matter with respect to sessions because sessions is basically a dead man walking
and nobody seems i mean who actually minimum condom mitch mcconnell did come in defend sessions the other day but this week i mean graham quarter like six different senators were like wow yeah looks like it's you know he's going to be fire now the question is there isn't one of the camera whose story it was but he said that the presence lawyers suggested that sessions could not be
that he shouldn't fire him before and mahler's report because it would support the idea that it's obstruction of justice because the president is mostly upset about the fact that sessions couldn't get it
recused himself and couldn't stop the special counsel so i i can imagine he waits that long i think at the most he waits till the end of the election buddy buddy
firing sessions at this point probably doesn't in the mall or and
well as a new a new attorney general is not accuse doesn't have a conflict so it takes rad rosenstein out presumably as the supervisor of sad investigation and then if you have a lackey and attorney general job then presumably you change the parameters you sort of quietly start undermining mellor and trying to
edit down and and that's that fear my name and to the extent that it give support for the idea that he's trying to end the investigation there may be previous testimony given by people like dumb again who's who might have been as seven months ago when the present one fire jeff sessions what was the reason he gave him the when and said well the reason he gave his that jeff sessions said recused himself and he was
instigation and it so who knows
oh my god it's amazing that all of the president's moves have to do with protecting himself investigation because i'm wrong doing have nothing to do with public policy that when you think about jeff sessions
jeff sessions
the two most effective and what's his name
the three most effective
members of the administration he forgotten scott who game that's so
i hope to never hear it again
i know but it is remarkable i mean jeff sessions who is doing god's work from the point of view of conservatives on so many france and the law and has been effective and a lot of ways that pursuing those goals as like turned into trumps who boy by am in there's just there's some just crazy weird like
greek tragedy element of that or fires
but i think you could i think
jeff sessions is the way i just tried to make began on a key player i think jeff the point you just both made his if you just think of the disconnect between policy and and her to impose yeah he is he is really doing the presidents work as as much as possible and yet is still being
hung out to dry the way is right
as you lucky fleet plus members experience every week we create special bonus segments of the first for slate plus listeners last week was an epic one it was well worth the price of admission which is for first your yourself for first year afloat both members did with thirty five dollars

a three judge panel again ruled north carolina two thousand and sixteen redrawn congressional map unconstitutional on i think first and fourteenth amendment grounds maybe we will say extra amendments that i've forgotten
originally i think you've got originally that map originally a different map with tossed in two thousand and eleven that map twenty eleven map had impermissible he deluded black voting power and been created the court said with the idea of deluding african american boats and twenty six team in north carolina legislature the ripples
chicken controlled north carolina legislature to a new map this time they said we were not trying to dilute black vote we're just trying to dilute democratic votes they came out and said the person who was in charge of it
came straight out and said it and he said the only reason we created a ten ten republican leaning districts and three democratically in district is that we couldn't figure out how to make it eleven and two so this is just the latest in a really remarkable and kind of appalling series of events in north carolina a purple state whose republican legislature
has engage in a series of really demoralizing practices to undermine a democratic governor rig or supreme court race regular congressional districts it's crazy
but emily talk about the legal issues at play the redistricting issues at play in the north carolina case because it's the latest in what seems like northern at number of these cases around the country
so this is a ruling from a three judge panel and it was a remarkable statement about the problems and didn't feel of this quiet the constitutional problems we have to partisan gerrymandering so to back that feminine in defense of the north carolina legislature who said yes yes were trying to read
democratic power to as few seats as possible when he said that he would have had every reason to think that it was perfectly legal what he was doing because the supreme court has never rejected or redistricting map because of partisan gerrymandering the court has not been in that business has not let lower courts do on that
regulating of how states draw maps so that's why you have these statements on the record from people admitting that that was the basis of the map can i just read one until your rep david lewis yeah justified the map by saying i think electing republicans is better than electing democrat so i drew this map to help foster what i
i think is better for the country yeah that's why david does is on the record in the way that he is and is now being mocked but in fact really speaking he was on solid enough grand when he said on that now is that a good idea i mean i don't think so and i think this three judge panel opinion does an excellent job of laying
out the problems from the point of view of both equal protection under the law of different voters and also freedom of association the problem with and jane man during is that you're punishing people for their political views and distorted and warping representation in a way that you know depresses the electorate mixed
people feel like the system is rigged because in fact is ranked so that's the kind of underlying issues can i ask what is the conservative case for not punishing states that jerry man for partisan reason also first of all it's not clear at all from the constitution that judges have the power to intervene so when you look at their
redistricting clause in the constitution it this that power to state legislatures mentions congress doesn't mention the judiciary so the original este argument from justice scalia when he was alive was that there's just no role for courts to play here and if states have a problem with destiny they need to change the process themselves on i
pass a law or ballot initiative on allowing for a nonpartisan independent redistricting commission and in fact those ballot initiatives are on on the ballot in five states
this november so there is an alternate remedy the idea that the courts have no role to play at all is extremely frustrating to people who are just like watching our political process on become so distorted and twisted through gerrymandering and so you see that frustration and the sense that the constitution should forbid best
from these judges and now you know in so the backdrop for this david as you are laying out is it north carolina all kinds of chicanery has been going on i mean remembered this is also the state which in around twenty eleven pass this law that had really restrictive voter id and took away early voting days and fourth circuit court of appeal said
that it was targeting african american voters have a surgical precision as you've got a lot of bad juju going on with voting rights you also have a governor where the ledge the democratic governor in the legislature trying to strip him of his power to make judicial appointments and put people on elections boards and then there was this whole massive china to change
the structure of the county election board so that they would very much favor republicans all this like basically just tinkering are messing with chicanery risque
he like that yeah all of this messing with the kind of structure of the democracy and a way that makes north carolina state governments started to look like it really is just about preserving republican power of that sad and i wonder why you think about this is the very end of august these elections are supposed to happen in nova
ember they have been the congress in north carolina has been elected in this heavily favoring republican candidates
way with this map since two thousand and eleven so this would be white fourth election with this messed up set of maps or a messed up set of congressional maps and yet is there enough time between now and november to fix this plausibly come up with a new nap what happens to primary
already had the primaries
the primates and i mean one idea out there is like you we hold the primaries on november six general election day and then you have a december election to see trains entire control of the house could be hanging in the balance in north carolina right i mean another option is luck it's dry these maps on a computer
i'm up with thousands of options ugly it's not like it takes weeks of preparation making the choice might be hard but you know the judges supposed to hear from the parties by the end of august i you tomorrow about what they think should happen next and these judges could order the legislature to come up with new maps in a few weeks
and how the legislature that if it can't do it will then the courts going to take over and that's essentially what happened in pennsylvania under a different set of time pressures because it was before the primary several say will loose make it all away
absolutely i mean the north carolina republicans have every incentive stick to the zoo to the supreme court but there's this sprinkle at the supreme court which is that it is for for at the moment and when there's a tie the lower court ruling is upheld meaning the ruling striking down the maps breck haven't i even
if he's confirmed quickly is not going to get seated in time probably to affect this vote and so the supreme court is not the refuge at the moment for the republicans that they would otherwise hope could know or so let's imagine there are some solution to this particular action but it ultimately get some supreme court when kevin seated
will be that because kevin a little bit five for with the conservatives in after november and of and are you okay so you're imagining a world in which the maps get redrawn redrawn some more democrats get elected north carolina and then the supreme court
knocks down the lower court ruling and the maps get to be redrawn well the thing about the maps though i guess they matter for two thousand and twenty because that's before the next census so dass there is one more drying of the maps but once you have water under the bridge all those actions take place i think gets a little harder to and surveys that and yet chicanery beauregard
who is famous north carolina
civil war general
statues of him yeah
chicanery bounding presumably they there would be more effort to fix that we're we're pretty far down the hypothetical lane
is it is tantalizing no to oct and emily
larger supreme court point there
given who have a noise and his record there is no chance of he becomes a fifth the boat
to get rid of partisan gerrymandering
things i'm into probably yeah seems as though that in but i mean look justice kennedy who had like opened the door to find me a method for moving again
a time a method for striking down extreme partisan and gerrymandering back to you open that door like twelve years ago and he backed away from it this spring cabin as one voting decision that i know about was to uphold the south carolina law that obama justice department wanted to strike down for being racially
discriminatory so while we know about his record suggests he is a safe vote for not involving arts and with gerrymandering
i mean there's a couple were point one is just i want to align myself with the man this is a short time it would require an extraordinary amount to have to print
briefly outside on new map you have to print new balance you've gotta get and the belt out the absentee voters which is always a huge delay
make a decision about the primaries like people want a partner in a district which have not been redrawn to do when the farmer
it's just a method does seem implausible to the other point i want to make it is obviously what has been going on in spades slick
pennsylvania or rico and wisconsin
met maryland really been a huge him and mentor is demoralizing but it's also kind of true that we've gerrymandered ourselves
and you're talking about the big soria the beach or i mean what's what's remarkable with countries how how partisan individual states had become for the most part that most states are now pretty safely one of the other and that even geographically
natural congressional districts are pretty much very well sorted themselves also that if you think about you know if you if you think about how you would draw
no she druid and squares but if you through said okay this is a natural region which someone should represent the city of new haven where you live to the new haven and going to heaven is one that yeah it's like probably ninety percent democratic and i i mean it's those out our district goes out but so i mean look it is absolutely true that the fact that democratic voters more and more
tend to cluster in urban areas has had an effect on the composition of congress it is also true that gerrymandering in extreme partisan fashion is a separate no no have mercy of course but
one final point on this actually either one of you i'm interested in your theory so they just to do some quick back of the envelope math
on this so as i understand and are counted release district basically so you draw districts it were eighty ninety percent democratic
three districts that were sort of eighty or ninety percent democratic and then ten districts that are sort of sixty percent republican yeah
it seems to me than know a wave election
those sixty percent republican districts there's a bunch of those it could be in serious trouble right there's been some discussion of that that some of the democratic candidates in districts that are not like cooper over rather say wait a second i'm not sure that in this particular race i want you to change my map right right right yes that's why it's complicated
finally
and just how does this all fit into the fight that several generations old which is the desire to have in particular have african americans have representation by african american legislators and which led to the drawing a majority minority districts across the south and particular
and has been crucial to the to maintaining representation by african americans in congress
it's a past generations for example of congressional black caucus wanted districts john so that minority voters could have a real shot at voting in canada their choice didn't i have to be a black represent ever hispanic representative in other parts of the country but it could be and it has been important
it also meant that
recently the democratic party has not had a white democratic candidates in congress from the south so and also that if you look state wide you were actually reducing the power of minority voters because they were also concentrated in electing they're very small number of representatives they couldn't influence other elections
so in the last i would say ten years eight years the democrats have really shifted in their legal and political positioning on this topic and so that's where you see candidates like stacey abrams in georgia and your guillen the democratic nominee for governor in florida
saying that a want to prove they can have state wide appeal by representing coalitions because they want to be more broadly attractive to the to funders to democratic voters they want to show that on you can be a minority candidate and get lots of votes and build a liberal coalition now way and
so i think what you're seeing is like in tandem that movement on to change the face of the democratic party also playing out in these redistricting fights where democrats are now saying we don't want eighty percent damn we don't even want sixty percent and there are some pretty good political science showing that
the penalty that minority candidates have paid in the past where like you know you could go to a place and show that john kerry got fifty percent of the vote of the of the wiper for barack obama only got forty percent or something like that there were a lot of efforts to use those kinds of comparisons to try to show
essentially what the tax for being a black or latino candidate would be in some parts of the country that taxes going away or it's much lower at least than it used to be and so the democratic legal argument is will in light of that social science it's were it's consistent or at least like a good reading of the voting rights
what we need here is enough composition of the vote of the electorate to have a plausible chance but we don't need to pack the voters in the way we use to

floyd has been much commemorated i know john dickerson you have spent a bunch of time this week talking about him and interviewing people about him he's been well remembered for whose whose side are to make fun of himself
willingness to reconsider ideas who's volcanic temper and sense of obligation and service
his heroism
as a prisoner of war
his interesting political career which which was all over the map elements of
conservatism liberalism iconoclasm some great choice and some bad choices let's not that we can spend as much time he goes and what i would like to as john what is going to stay with him after you know having a long relationship with mccain personally and then being through this week of thinking about man not it's a good question
because he was obvious am incredibly complicated guy he's supported things that were policies that were in some senses you know he thought his party on tobacco legislation to get tobacco advertising away from young kids and into
to squeeze the pernicious role of money and politics
and the tobacco bill died he was successful with mccain feingold until the courts basically unwound most of it
and and you can debate about whether mccain feingold itself as the right tool but having covered people in politics for many years as i have the power of people with money to influence their behavior and legislation is impossible to refute and it is such a lock
so anybody who fought his party and remember that in in two thousand what he did was he ran against his entire party and the establishment of the party saying that they were all corrupt because of their relationship with money now this is where it gets into some of his complexity where did his inspiration for that come from his own sin jang as a part of
keating five and he was not of the five he can make the case was kind of the the least involved in there were wasn't quid pro quo exactly he wasn't and he was doing basically and this was his argument i mean he'd so he took some he got some free flights from a donor and all of which was legal but
you know it's he used to argue that the illegal things are the ones that you that should be illegal wouldn't come out against the
the confederate flag and south carolina during the primary in two thousand and then after he lost came back and said you know that was wrong and i i am a millionaire palin said you know that them mistake though he still never quite but no he said i should have picked lieberman i think so
that's the whole big public thing i think what stuck with me as a number of smaller stories that of things he did in his life to people both known and unknown the mo you'd all story is i know one of your favorites david which michael lewis chronicled so nicely well utah a democratic congress man who took mccain under his
when when he first came to congress after he had parkinson's amazon and veterans hospital and was had wasn't getting a lot of people coming to see i'm john mccain made raider regular visits to go talk to my you'd all who by the time he was near death was not had no idea john mccain was there but he kept he kept going and lewis wrote about that but i heard about it at the time
time when i was doing my reporting on came back in ninety nine jacob who was who was in the navy for most of his welfare isn't years and years i can enter known anybody he was that he was the one who met mccain when he came off the boat
from after being released from noise
mccain didn't remember who he was but coop his whole life he's in he's a guy with the moustache and the pictures of mccain when mccain heard that he was dying and was in hospice called him and and just sort of backed him up at the right there at the end of his life which nobody ever knew a man i only know about it because i knew jay coop
lots of those stories of come out this week
and so there is the complex public life there are also lots of stories of him being bitter and petty and and you wouldn't shake duncan one hundred and i don't think for the most of his life till graham went and supported george w bush after mccain was the chairman i think of grams campaign took a long time to repair that so i'm not saying it was a same
and by any means but i think at the end of your life you want to have enough of those stories that people come forward and say you know here's a story you've never heard about him doing something to make someone else feel better and improve the lives of someone
my friend about mccain is he was obviously a great man and a great human being and the stories that you
meant in their john from really
incredible human quality and everything that happened during vietnam from it was important is there mccain is is there does he leave a political legacy
i mean i think that's complicated to under one hand the contrast he provides depressed and trump is stark and important right now in his farewell statement was full of the idea of the unity and against tribalism which is not the direction
that trumps republican party is going in whatsoever and that's important
and yet i also think it's important to remember that yes mccain voted hang on to the affordable care act but then turned around and voted for tax cuts that did a lot of the damaged affordable care act and obama care that he had previously offended
he also voted for trunks judicial appointments there are a lot of ways in which he remained very much
whale republican soldier in the senate even when rhetorically he was providing are we all alternate to have to trump as am so again it like it's just complicated
i do think the metaphor i think about with mccain a lot if that use a huge boxing fan one time i met him
i was interviewing and belt ultimate fighting with you hated and we got into big squabble about it
and he but barack boxing is guided by these rules the markers or queens rules which are which are rules about true gentlemen we behavior within the context of beating somebody in a boxing match and i always felt like that is a real metaphor for how mccain acted in the world which is that he he
fundamentally thought there was gentle there with gentlemanly behavior an honor in the fight even though he himself had been as a victim of torture people who are not fighting fair not treating him with honor but that he he was going to
with integrity even in times when you were in conflict with other people i think that's a like a very admirable noble and mike very last kind of tradition and i felt a vaccine you were going to say it was the one i always mention which is when he was at the naval academy name is boxing his strategy
he would basically run into the middle of the ring and just start throwing punches
which which has typifies the way he approaches some legislation and some of the political fight he caught in it wasn't exactly
it was it a lot of flurry and fury when he did the it to me mccain is absolute
standing against torture was the boast just principled thing about him that thought was a line that it didn't matter how much president bush was going to appeal to him to cross said after nine eleven mccain just stood there and
had an enormous impact by refusing to recognize any kinds of grey areas are compromised and far as i can tell and maybe it's because obviously like you see the horror of having the lines
washoe and the sand you experience that personally and so than in that context you hang on to them let me ask you this question which is in a time where there is some debate so critically when his own party about whether america is an idea or in america or america is a geographical place and we have a specific kind of
lineage somebody who believe that america was an idea which to his critics was a disaster because i believe that it meant that america wasn't depressed it's idea on other places where he thought human rights were at stake and that meant military intervention
for the restless support for the iraq war right so his his critics the idea that he supported which is the idea that people should be free and that america should go in intervene in the service of that idea is obviously one of their if not their biggest critique against him and yet in the moment when he is speaking out against what he calls the spirit
the spurious nationalism he is arguing america is an idea it is not a place it is not a land of blood and soil
so how to you is there a place for the virulent mccain critics on policy grounds to nevertheless support his affirmation in all that he did have the idea that america is a set of ideas and not something that you get just because you were born here guess there
i certainly that is my belief that is what i want even to somebody who has become increasingly skeptical of american military intervention i would so much rather have that sense of what america is than the than the blood and soil fence of it wasn't little sense of it is is sick and narrow and vicious
and and also creates a worse world clearly grits are worse world there are huge problems with the mccain project power invade everybody let's attack iran motive but you know if you force me to pick one of them i would much much rather have it in america that is too ambitious and too idealistic abroad and
one that is that an isolationist and narrow and and shuts itself off i think you could also argue yes america is an idea now let's fight over what that idea is and let's have an idea that actually like helps or at least is available and accessible to all americans i mean there's always struggle
for me and understanding what the idea is if it doesn't translate into policies that make lots of people's lives better and i think the potential power of of the idea and this is now i'm slipping and changing that to really mean norms i think you know
oh a lot this week people been talking about his concession speech in two thousand and eight to president obama and the time at the smith dinner during the campaign in which again we're measuring moral distance here of the moment where you have the president who's and off is now as for five years america's chief birth her and you have mccain when he was running for president at the
smith dinner
and when obama is there in the audience praising him while he's in the middle of a political fight against him praising him for his good qualities and then in his concession speech trying to create because he was trying to live up to his notion of an idea of what a good loser is back to your boxing metaphor david
you know trying to deliver a speech that they praised obama and set the conditions for coming back together
and that's all based around this notion of an idea of how you're supposed to behave which which is very much up for grabs in parts of our political life right now

when you are
extremely delicious rob as my wife the other night
they like this for a shrub had drank a shrub yes
robbins know over strobe it's like a vinegar very the vinegar free drink but you can mix it with alcohol
the shrub itself is called even worth not garlic and then if you mix it with are called still called a shrub
i think she had a gin clear with jim
prefer with vodka because i don't get she wasn't drinking a bus she was not talking about shoot having a shrug very been agree but fruity shrub when you're having that emulate what will you be chattering about you if you ever get lucky chance to have a shrub
i now have to wait for that
a lot with my oatmeal which has not arrived in new haven yet so california ended cash bal on this week which is a big deal and means uprooting the bal industry and yeah add on a lot of civil rights groups and thought hard for our farm in california ended up opposing this
oh and feeling very concerned about what the implications are going to be and the reason is that along the way tag gathering enough votes to pass according to its sponsors that bill created much more room for judges to put people in preventive detention in other words you get arrested the prosecutor say that you're a danger you're no longer
are going to have to find the money for are some really high a bail as the way of presumably keeping you locked up before trial the judge is going to be able to say like your risk it so we're keeping you for that reason and i just have no idea i mean no one does of whether the fears
is about this
new regime in california are gonna be realized are not and part of the reason is that california is also waiting for a ruling from its supreme court about the constitutionality of bail and the court could limit the categories of people who are eligible for preventive detention and away and what i think take away a lot of the
sting the potential staying of this of this new way of approaching where people and up before their trials so they're just all these unresolved questions but for me the thing that i keep coming back to his that it's become really clear to me and my reporting that eliminating cash bail is like absolutely
we should do in this country and for profit bail is just a scored on the nation and yet figuring out what's going to replace said for people accused of felonies and violent felonies is not obvious like their various ways that on the state can deal at those situations you know in my view you want to be detaining as few
people as possible when they're presumed innocent new jersey's reforms are a lot of interest to me they've been operating for a while new jersey just is a different animal from california
it was much more orderly and unified in its approach to getting rid of cash bail california when in this other direction from the point of view of the laboratory of democracy or just a journalist observing it's good news to have lots of different models but i just don't know what to make of this spell in california
you can make a hat
you can make a
what a new yorker well my channel or is
when i was in south bend indiana on monday interviewing porn
president jimmy carter which was a joy he was
amazing what he has done with habitat for humanity and then when they do them they build forty one houses this army of volunteers arrived seventeen hundred of them and when you stand among them while they're in the middle of one of these builds it's the constant sound of hammering it's just as beautiful symphony of all of loosing credit
a productive work i'm hearing the stories of the families who put all the work into their own as amazing because amazing anyway i interviewed the president about that but i asked a lot of other questions including and we talked in them and show about sort of the distance the moral distance we travel and norm shift and change and and so but one than i was thinking about when i met up with him was
right before his debate against gerald ford in nineteen seventy six party was taking a train ride to the to the debate and all the reporters run one place and they were all handed by the
by the campaign and interview that he had done with playboy magazine he said that he had lusted in his hard about other women this caused an uproar a flap it was on the eve of the debate many people thought going to torpedo his candidacy
and so i was just thinking about what causes of president to flap new in this case he was a candidate the kinds of things in public life that get you in trouble he and so i asked him about this
and he said he said this and response i asked him to reflect back on that playboy interview moment that had been such a big deal at the time with respect to our current things in the current like he did not decide to make any in contemporary comparisons but he did say this i lost fifteen percentage points in the public opinion polls overnight
so that's fifteen points and he said all i did actually was quote the bible precisely because i just quoted jesus and his sermon on the mount
several of them out talks about lusting in your in your heart and so he's right corner says unfortunately it was either deliberately or inadvertently misinterpreted by playboy magazine i quoted the bible to you know the wrong destination
so anyway as you're thinking about how the presidency has evolved and the role of character and sexual piccadilly those it was once a flap to accurately quote the bible about not actual adultery not paying hush money for alleged adultery but simply having the
thought of
adultery in your head
well
much better
we didn't get a chance to talk about absolutely astonishing appalling store in washington post
i suspect will become a bigger story over the course of the week the news that the united states is moving to deny passports to american citizens
who live on the border people mostly of mexican descent to live in texas arizona new mexico live near the border were born in the united states have american birth certificates and us and same when they apply for passports well we don't think your birth certificate is legit people who served in the us military
raised families here it's pretty shocking example of fashion from on the creep
it is a policy that the obama administration started the trump administration is massively accelerating so it's not something which trump invented it's a bad situation i'm so glad i was thinking of chattering about that i'm really glad you got it yeah
i mean i'm sure we'll end up suspect this is the story that will have legs because it it's disturbing my actual chatter is another washing post story about something called epic nerd camp which is a adult camp i'm always suspicious of adult camps truthful
a little bit odd but a partner camp just seems really nice it's a chance for people to do live action role playing a role playing games cause play one making sword fighting quit which whether name
make effects make up the post described in foot burning nerd
and just it was a lovely story about people who have interests that are somewhat offbeat interests and finding each other and you a chance to spend four days in the woods with no judgement and a lot of joy
check out the the story on epic nerd camp
is it
so in the woods and it's kind of fantasy
dungeons and dragons slash harry potter slash talking are lots of different cultures so there's there's some their detriment token the different when harry potter there's some star trek people are star wars people are people so there's been a lot of different stuff nice it's all all
