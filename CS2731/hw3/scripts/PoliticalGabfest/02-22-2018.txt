the portland massacre has not come and gone the way mass shootings usually do a nation that had been inured to school massacres is suddenly paying attention because there is a cadre of passionate
very angry and barry righteous because they are right students who are speaking up and demanding gun control
students from douglas high school have trekked to tallahassee to here to to watch and bear witness as the florida legislature
rejected and assault weapons ban on wednesday
the third legislature however did declare pornography dangerous to health you'll be glad to hear any
they didn't manage passed that law the douglas students also appeared on television repeatedly demanding action for politicians including astonishing cnn town hall on wednesday night where they harried and grilled their senator marco rubio they are more organizing the march for our so washington dc march on march twenty fourth that is
already funded by george clooney and oprah winfrey there have been and are going to be more local walkouts all over the country
the the students are so successful they are also under assault from various kinds of internet trolls as well as conservatives who who paint them as professional protesters or as puppets liberal parents so anyway why we will do you think these students are breaking through the debate on gun control in a way that no one has
for a long time i think so the fact that they're so young fact that they're so passionate the fact that they aren't practiced at talking to legislate are the fact that there are so angry i feel like there's still a great piece to be written about how sandy hook changed dc i think it is really a turning point
for liberals but also conservatives there is this great feeling that nothing literally nothing whatever get congress to act on unless issue if you can go shoot twenty kindergartners and nothing will happen and so i think it's been really surprising to see these teenagers comment and really feel like they are shifting the debate and they're not
going to stop and there is now going to be this huge rally and there's going to be tremendous attention on all of these legislators and i'm not sure that i entirely understand why this has gotten traction and a way that at our shootings i'm like the one in las vegas haven't but i think it has to deal with they're very unusual voice in the fact that these these kids
are coming and i being such unbelievable advocates for themselves and other teenagers
john why do you think they're breaking through their a different voice in this they are the victims because it happened at their school and they're they're just in this kind of niche between adults who are written who kind of written off in the traditional back and forth grooves of that dead and debate on guns
but not so young that they would be kept off of television
and i think i think it varies a lot of contributing factors
part of it has got to be the frustration a lot of people feel more broadly with with president trump at this moment there's obviously the most important he is the specifics of the case or which are awful and but but it's and he was saying before the awfulness of the specific case hadn't kicked the a debate out of its right so within you
what's different here i think what is different here is that
in some sense a president who rushes to fill the emotional void as presidents have in so many previous instances in some ways allows release for everybody who's watching and there was no release here there was no
or that wasn't a part of the story so that's another thing that's different and i think also there's a lot of political energy about
this would be outside of of the florida but i think in the country a desire to push back against the larger president that may be a part of this as well that's a that's a really good point but the trumps
weak response or or his inability to show deep empathy and and sympathy
made it possible for this to come forward i do wonder though i mean the newtown parents after sandy hook shooting mean these are parents who had lost their children
and raised so compelling they woke up and they were tarred they were bet that didn't last like the there
them as as sanctify avatars of this issue didn't last and do you think that's going to happen with these these children i mean that we're already of course seeing some of it already where people actually know they're just you know their professional protesters hurts
have been programmed by their liberal f b i dad or whatever it is but
do you think it's you think the sympathy that they have garnered indoors i think that the fact that it feels like it's transferring into other forms of action and protest matters a lot so there is this rally plan for dc there's celebrities that are donating money to add they're all sorts of action and lie down
there's walk out there is a school district and taxes that told students that they would be suspended if they did anything i think that it is great movie
like it was like a dumbass
set up for liberals know exactly and it was also i mean having been a teenager once gosh nothing would have made me happier than meant to be told not to not he is my first amendment rights and so i feel like there's a way in which this is this is moving to a form of political pressure that's probably
really appealing ted to motivate young kids in fact that you're seeing other high school students get behind this and do the same thing students in dc have had several actions and you go down to the white house there's been and continue all protests
i'm not sure that has happened after a las vegas or after the orlando sheeting or even after new town and maybe i'm forgetting something but i don't remember it moving to this other kind of form of civil disobedience and and this other sort of area prevalent form a political pressure in trying to figure out where what soon what's on day one thing that has struck me is that we saw had both
and then town hall and we've seen some degree with the president that there was a conditioned response to these which is there are a response which is guns don't kill people people kill people and so there is the immediate effort in the president was part of this as well and in previous massacres where he immediately dealing to the question of guns from from the issue
here when the president first talk to my when others talked about mental health at seemed to be following that similar pattern but then the president in response to this has talked about everything from changing age limits to background checks to now those are are potentially they could be meaningful or they could be headaches
i mean so in other words when you're talking about background checks there's everything from the corn and bill
to what to me and mansion put forward and two thousand and thirteen that's a big difference the energy supports one the a worked very very hard to kill the other which they were successful in doing so
when their presence as he wants to do something on background checks there's a huge thing he could possibly do but the fact that he is that all talking about gun related measures in response to this seems to me actually is a something that is different and marco rubio when pressed by a father at the town hall and cnn who said or guns about fears and
yo gave him another answer and then he said no answer my question our guns are part of this and when rubio said yes then it becomes okay what are we going to do even that is a shift
the political process is usually what causes those who would like to see reform on any gun legislation that's what usually crushes their hopes and that's yet to come so one of the things that i think marco rubio ended yesterday was all of times gun control advocates say it's the array or blame put put the blame squarely on me
and i think people on the right thing
the enter a powerful because it represents actually a strong body have committed voters and the problem that gun control advocates have had is that there is not the same level motivation and commitment and ability to hold politicians accountable
our for gun control the way there is for gun rights is there any chance any that this
this movement
create a block of actually committed donors and voters who can exercise that same effect on the left that gun rights that gets it had on the right i think that that's really pressing and open question and when you get ten to policy when they are it note is that everything that people are talking about if you think about a minimalist her
maximum less spectrum whereas still kind of talking about fairly minimal last measure the american public broadly speaking it's very supportive of have gotten control either and seven percent background check yeah i mean and even republicans right be right there isn't a lot of demand for ad it's not people's top issue
yes they're heavily in support of maxima last second amendment rights and minimalist lies i would expect that what will happen is that congress will pass something that folks are not sure is actually going to be enough to prevent these in the future and you've seen in other countries i'm a thing as australia where they had one of these
it ends and they basically pulled all the guns back they said you have to turn all of these and now now he's talking about that kind of policy here and so even when this happens again when it happens again and i'll be interesting to see what the argument as than right like while we passed on to control and it didn't work because they're still is deranged mad men out there right i mean the on the assault i mean people
oh well you had an assault weapons ban and there were still massacres including but in fact they dropped a lot but there were still enough that people could say oh it didn't work right
notably there's not great evidence the government does not study this as closely as people would like even just doing something like that in and we need a lot more data while because because right are not allowed to start exactly they're not going to fund research at the moment in terms of polling in lots going to change and pulling is inaccurate of and let's not put too fine a point on this but
in the polling which has shown that traditional public support for measures and and blamed congress and president there has not been movement on the question of of an assault weapons ban and still roughly a fifty countries basically evenly split on that so it has not
what it seems like a lot of the kids would like is a full band and i'm not sure there's the public support for that just yet
i think i'll be curious if if we are in a world where democrats retake the house i think it will be curious to see because i would not be surprised if knowing that it was not going to be signed into law they started passing these fairly you know i think i'd be interesting to see if they started passing i'm bringing them up and taking that kind of high ground on that issue and saying well
there were passing a law that would have actually prevented some of these incidents and republicans are the ones that are blocking it do think that during this next eight ten months before the election
there's any chance of legislation or is it going to be i mean we have mitch mcconnell
there's anything that mitch mcconnell can do you can slow down
legislation if he chooses i think the
for something to get through congress and get to the president's desk would require an actual concerted endorsement from paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and the majority of republicans is there any chance that you guys see that that's actually going to happen
i think that they'll pass something actually i think that they'll pass something small they'll make the calculation that i would be better at to say we passed a sensible gun control mash are and to sort of neutralize that electoral he for them they're facing a very hard election in november i think that they will do something that will hopefully not completely and better the second man
mint voters to them
i'll be able to say that they did at least you know they pass something that's my guess president trump
you know which of course should be cautious about describing any intentional or a or thought or actual policy to anything that he says or tweets but his set of statements and tweets about arming teachers
there's no chance that this is going to become part of this is there there's no chance that can be teachers teachers teachers concealed carry in classrooms that's just an unseemly bad idea
there is more support for it than you
then you might think there was a story about of policemen in ohio who said he would offer teachers concealed carry classes and he then put out word that he had to stop enrollment at three hundred because he'd already in just a short period of time gotten three hundred people who had who had asked for that training the first of all we should note that that
in this instance there was a security guard with a gun so when the president talked about gun free schools where nobody can fire back that was not the case there was somebody there who could have you just didn't run into shooter so but also then you get escalation you get cheaters who will then take it take that into account and change their tactics accordingly which which
escalation in more potential catastrophic casualties got it made me sell angry president trump has this habit of suggesting is unbelievably radical policy ideas with absolutely no research backing no consultation with experts nothing a it's basically a troll right
it would be possible to study and to ask expert on this kind of violence you know how many deaths by accident would be caused by this how many more shootings what there be because some kid pulls the gone off of the teacher even just a question of like the parents have a right not to send their kids into a school where they know that somebody has a gun and might not be appropriately trained with that
what message are you sending their children if the teachers are armed like it's just so infuriating that you would kind of like toss this off them know i can't imagine that this is going to become an issue and also you know how many people at that concert in las vegas had gotten a lot at play here and also yeah and some of
he said his teachings hard enough without having to then have to carry my life and death decisions in your bed when when i interviewed will here he said you know where all it takes her to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun in that one it
solution in in vegas like how does this play out your in the concert you you're carrying a weapon in somebody starts firing from up in the windows of a hotel what do you turn on fire and if you miss what happens you're suddenly shooting into hotel rooms like the the i don't get heather like as huge quite rightly said
las vegas
everybody being armed would not have settled the situation down and it's not clear to me that in any of these school shootings having teachers have a huge number of guns what if what have done anything i mean you can almost think about like support for more defensive measures that some actor say that schools need to make sure that their doors are bullet afraid
that's still kind of horrifying that lake anyway so no i would be i would be shocked if that became a policy proposal
i do think that there is going to be this argument for the expansion of concealed carry and for a general encouragement of people to to protect themselves you know the thing that bothers me about it just philosophically to is is that this like you know an erosion of the state monopoly on violence right i understand that this is supposed to be defensive but like don't you have a right
to or an expectation that you're not living in a violent society and that you don't have to deal with s while it's there's this weird conflict which is that you have also and an army of the states or the right rise of swat at the qualification at the police like huge investments in the military and national guard armory her and the second the purpose of this
amendment is to protect us against the predictions that militarized state rain but yet we're we're excessively militarize in the state bread at the same time
well they they need to have more arms it's just even stepping back further the countries in which this doesn't happen there's way fewer guns
like we know that that's that's one of the businesses but this is like a closure right right but you have conservatives that the conservative world view about this is that people have a right to be armed and the right to make individual decisions that will make they believe that will make themselves safer
and that's a whole world view and liberals have an opposite world view which is that there just needs to be at the escalation and fewer guns and me cops and britain don't carry gun know don't down and what's funny is i their crime shows in britain their crimes are always much more horrific because you have to stab people are like hit them with something in order to kill that me
can't just shoot them and all of this is because it has been there was when i grow up an grew up in west hartford connecticut there is a neighbor of ours and he was a defense like a criminal defense attorney and a gun in his house and we were never allowed to go in there and play with his kids in the house i had to come to ours like our mom wouldn't let us go into a house where she knew that there was a
gun and i was thinking i was like what would it would my mom had felt comfortable sending her kids to a school where all the teachers were armed it's so nutty it so well i don't yeah
i don't think i think that's excessive on your brother's part i mean if you don't know that the neighbors
gun safety he keeps it unlocked i mean if it's a neighbor is careful about it
like a perfectly reasonable thing i would let my kids go to places i don't check to see whether their friends have guns she knew how dumb her children were

the muller freight train shrugs along this weekend dated a dutch lawyer who was linked to pomona for and but gates gates
last week was even bigger news last week
or thirteen russia individuals and three russian companies charging them with various crimes but those crimes that essentially added up to you interfered in our election by using social media and other channels to divide americans and to promote donald trump and underwriting hillary clinton
the trump response to the indictment has been strange and troubling rather than talking about are worrying about a russian assault on the american electoral process he has been treating about how we were being laughed at by russians for per our investigation of it he's claiming redemption because the latest indictment did not accuse
i'm of collusion
john it's weird the way he's responding to it but is it to haul surprising given who he is well
well and me know as you quite rightly point out he is he has responded to things consistently with in paulson and without restraint and so you you you would expect him to and intact that's been the problem here the ban and said this decision to fire james kill me was the big the worst possible mistake that doesn't trump is ever
made and he basically did it
in bands view
external views because he couldn't he just couldn't stand it he couldn't restrain himself and that that's been a constant thing here so the fact that he's keeping and in the news against his self interest is goes back to that lack of restraint
so i guess it's not a surprise by he also has this indomitable will for self preservation we should argue for just moving on and doing something else and not keeping everybody focus on russia and why why is the focus on russia so important here is because these these indictments the twenty two
who were indicted last friday
and even the new stuff that happened this week is all validation of the authority of the of the muller process process both inform how incredibly painstaking in careful muller is but then also in substance that he is talking about here in these indictments about an effort to overthrow are undermined at the very least
american democracy and so you can't call it a witch hunt anymore when it is doing this important work and so the extent that that's continually in the news cycle and undermines the president's larger gold to claim that mahler's engage in a witch hunt
any there's a comfortable com a minor times that
people have been talking about this week which are use a trump either actively wants to help or is incredibly stupid or most likely that he is actually effectively being blackmailed that he himself has some information that he thinks that russians have on him
and that that is why he wants to shut this investigation down and treatment posits that it's probably some financial chicanery that he doesn't want to come out what did you find that persuasive
i think that are there is this russian nesting doll
have implications from white muller from what we know of the mother investigation what we now have these indictments there was like a lot of parts to that's right so there's russia interfering in the election there's the question of the trump campaign colluding with the russians in order to help themselves there's the question of whether that tipped the election
trump which i think it's not actually an important point that as something that they're saying there there's a question of whether the trump organisation knew what they were doing was wrong or illegal there's a question of trumps financial problems there's the question of jared kushner financial problems which i find very very interesting and and the truth
is that for all that we know about this there's so much that we don't know right it's really actually hard to tell what the heck is going on and because muller's keeping things so close to that to the vast and also because congress has utterly failed to deal it's investigatory to do its job and investigate this as well if we had a bench
have congressional commissions that we're going after that it's really hard there's would presumably be leaking more and we have more information about this but we don't write this is quite the iceberg so like i think that the friedman you know idea is interesting but like who knows what the hell is going on there it's unless you have subpoena power and all of these
tax returns and all of these emails all of which we know he has am a i think that the unknown unknowns are so great here and it's why it's and sell excited for whenever he wrap this up with his you know like murderers row of of legal talent that he's assembled it's astonishing and i really you know we're kind of reading tea leaves right
well one of the things about the tea that were reading is how not only painstaking muller is it just seems like he is operating in a level no congressional committee has ever operated on an average user has he said
such skill and also in in both men were manner for it was busted for working on that op ed that was supposed to support him and right and what struck me about that is man he pay or listening to everything you do and that was true in the indictment of this lawyer who lied to scan nerves lawyer who lied
they basically had his emails and phone phone records and like they're watching and they have watched a lot and they've been watching for a while and so the and which i don't think congress could have gotten that can maybe even those authorities or managed the way day
it just seems like of an operating seems to so wholly so much more competent and also not just competent but also just skills at the international investigators just don't have going back to the indictment of the russian individual than the russian entities i think there's a there's a theological dispute about the name
such interference on one side there is people saying this is the worst attack on the united states since nine eleven it's an attack on the fundamental integrity of the electoral process
any honorable president any president who was fulfilling his duty is in the office would declare a national emergency and be convening hardening all our electoral systems and and holding constant public meetings about it and and working as as much as possible to prevent out
side interference that's one sided of the other side of it which i think articulated by marcia guessing very well was basically this was a kind of the standard disruptive up of the sort that the russians and the soviets had been doing for generations against the united states now using new technology and new
mechanisms not done particularly well done done by people whose english was he and his methods were okay and that fundamentally what was successful that they just identified fault lines in american life and expose them but those divisions and fault they didn't cause those divisions and fault line says divisions exist and they do
they multiply they increase their power slightly but the fact is that we wanted to believe the things that they were telling us and these in these trolling false post so that rather than panicking about russia is doing me to panic about our own civic disengagement and end
our own civic division
which of those two the views do you have any or maybe you can hold both of them simultaneously you can say is both a terrible attack and also really divided ray i mean a i think that both of those things eritrea and ultimately i think that the russian thoughts in the face by terrorists and all of this is sort of our falcon out here
the theft and the release of the emails the potential back scratching between the tramp campaign and the russian government the potential financial ties between right man for a separate from a separate from the factory the yeah exactly i actually think that the damn as possible response to this is the people that have been saying like wow the us as this
til
what does that matter at all so yeah the i think both of those things are true but again it's just like sort of one perhaps less important set of is the i mean it's it's bad it's a really really bad it said something really bad about facebook and twitter that they've let this happen and then a i do i think that there
this this this way in which we're not taking seriously enough in fact that there's these foreigners were messing with our elections it's awful even if it didn't have very much on in fact and even if it was like ham fisted he has basically facebook and twitter in our whole lives and the attention shredding we allow into our lives and embrace as a culture is basically the
that was put into our culture and that that has to do both with the way we spend our time but also the way we spend our political time is that we've kind of hooked ourselves into this ivy of emotional
craziness in fast news cycle and cable news and social media and with the russians did was they just switched out the bag
they just put in their bag of bad stuff but there is a pretty bad
bad going into the ivy already and i worried that the efforts to change get facebook to to monitor stuff better and get youtube just stopped allowed trending videos that are total hoaxes that's all good and important but there is a huge part of this that is us not giving into our worst emotionally
impulses about anything whether it's politics or just the way we're think about other people and i don't want the reckoning that has to take place on that front to to not take place because people are blaming the russians are youtube or whatever
right right no it's like there's already
this technology
the way that we relate to each other the division of the country already cause so much doubt and dissension in misery and people and so much kind of constant anxiety and monitoring of of perceived wrongs been done to you are perceived bronx been done to people who support that work
we're incredibly vulnerable to it and yeah i think that's very well put on a and
any i think it's good that you're drawing a distinction between the campaign that mahler's talking about which is the sort of social media disruption and separating that from the theft of emails and the the shady business dealings which are which are have a level of corruption and potential for disruption that i think are
really profound i think that there's this this question of electoral hacking that again is is not exactly what we're talking about when we're talking about these kind of disinformation grain and and got serious hacking a serious truly terrifying right and could actually really have an effect and it is where we're in an election year
to my knowledge and correct me if i'm wrong congress hasn't passed laws to do that in like to investigate and to try to prevent this from happening it hasn't hallowed twitter and facebook accountable for their role in this it's a funny conference and a bunch of right everything from this kind of like question of motivated reasoning and a hyper polarized police
local environment to the way in which we are just emotionally involved with these platforms that are terrible for our brain instead to to than this kind of modern day watergate sorry just to review this just i because i want to get this and my own head so as i hear you talking there
four different potential or four different kinds of disruption that that russia might have practice in the election one of which which has identified her maryland this indictment is basically using the tools of social media to cause dissension and right that's number one number two is actually hacking election system's going to after voter rolls yeah messing with things which we know there were some
effort at what we don't know what i'm gonna be honest i'm again yep third is the theft of emails from protest from the dancy rain and the distribution of those at timely moments train cause dismay and election fourth is the actual potential collusion between russian actors and
people in the term campaign and then fifth is whatever sort of shady financial dealings there may be between people connected to trump and russians right
i think those are all distinct semi distinct and all of our are semi distinct and a lot of it you know and then there this question and there's there's multiple actors with hand right manner for was and is unwise and reckitt isn't was just enormously corrupt but really is an amazing unkind and
you know and the evidence that we have it is fascinating question relates to what we're talking about earlier that there's just so much more to come out what about this
man two things as you potentially clothes off this topic is on his me see if i can follow this line of thought
it seems to me that if you are mental some russians and we should point out that part of what them the modern day and showed was that the russians helped metal on the left as well and particularly after president trump was elected that they started trying to agitate on the left to become part of the resistance if you are russians in the wanting to metal wouldn't you spend
your mental some dollars most effectively by essentially ginning up the left allowing them to elect a lot of officials who then presumably get the democrats trying to impeach the president at the very least get a democrat elected to gum up the operations
the federal government but that that would be you're smart play if you're an ideologically agnostic russian medlar so if that's the case shouldn't donald trump have a new reason to really care about this and that's my one point the second is that he in the reporting the new york times is done and that the wall street journal did about the president's alleged
she affair with the porn star
with the new york times is done in general is done is sketched out a thorough and extent system for of pay offs and manipulating and managing unpleasant information okay so if you had a system in place that was an operating several different times and is that
the case then when the russians work as we know trying to break into the and not break into but find common cause with the trump campaign
that instinct for doing things around the normal system i can't imagine that it wouldn't have kicked in somehow
and we don't have any evidence of that but i just think that we one of the things we also learned this last week is just how easily the president and his lawyers and other people kind of had this off the books system of dealing with things i want to close with actually one final point because russia has essentially felt no consequence for
digital warfare it is interfered in the business the internal doing to the estonia it interfered in georgia i suspect it interfered in ukraine electronically
it is the country's very happy to to engage in digital guerrilla warfare and has really not been punished in any meaningful way for and i wonder if there is any way to punish them because one of the things about digital warfare as it's very asymmetrical you are the if you are the
her power sure we can go and mess with the russian electoral system but what good would it do authority a corrupt system or we could we could
mess with do denial of service attacks to russian websites but their denial of service attack to an american website called so much more damage than anything we can do to them so is there anything you can do when someone is engaging and asymmetrical warfare against you
that we almost kind of forget when you just go back and look at what obama dead expelling the diplomats and raising the sanctions that she has tons of leverage to poll ray like tremendous financial sanctions the us can really hurt the russian economy
it has huge amounts of diplomatic threats and and the current administration just refuses to to do that congress could be doing more as well and there's been a choice not to and whoever is president after trump it's hard for me to imagine that they would end as a policy matter began getting google of postman after trampoline
i was told me that someday we can't continue with us for seven seven seven years from now

the twenty eighteen election got started for real this week there was early voting in texas's primaries the start of a nine month slog that will only feel like it's nine years long
the biggest news of the week was that mitt romney for presidential candidate former governor of massachusetts
business man savior of the two thousand to salt lake city olympics will run to succeed or and hatch
and the utah senate
early american senate from utah
retiring after serving for one hundred and forty three years and the senate
if romney accepted trumps endorsement despite a mixed history with the president which we can get into he he sharply he took he took trumps endorsement back in two thousand and twelve and romney it was running for president he's sharply criticized trumpet during the twenty sixteen campaign when trump
was elected he talked to trump about becoming a secretary of state but was thrown over for a killer send in what was it really cruel seemed like a really cruel intentional way by trump he has been very critical of president trumpet since he took office
but
it's fun to contemplate the idea of mitt romney in the senate i love mitt romney i think mitt romney is one of the great public servants in american life and he almost certainly will be elected if he is elected any is he likely to be it an opponent of trump islam or as you just going to be you know your standard issue
conservative senator from a western state i have to imagine that he is going to take that seriously and he is going to relish holding that trumped white house accountable if that is that is my guess he has a very pure public servant senators our house members are always weigh less powerful than you imagine and senators are more powerful there's not that much
any of them and and they have some pretty cool superpowers i think that he's going to take this job very seriously and i think that you have seen this kind of craven way in which are republicans on the hell have refused to have been excited about passing legislation and therefore have kind of abrogated
their their duty to ham and the executive and to investigate the white house and to use the tools at their disposal to enact change with the trump administration and i think that romney just being romney is going to go and be romney john one of the things that i liked reading about as i was reading about run is candace he was as i
have you talk and separatism which is basically when people say that they really mean mormon conservatism which is pro trade pro export largely pro immigrant were looking socially very conservative but very collegial and pretty good manners
and it's to me like when i think about what is the last hope for rapprochement in american politics i kind of think that utah conservatism
on the right and maybe maybe
virginia virginia democrats on the left that those are the models were there's a possibility that there hope that there's still some kind of sense that we can work together there's some sense of collegiality some sense that
you know we're going to manage this
to share that hope i like that you know i'm basically share that hope for mankind but i like where you have them
where you you have placed it so the question though then is how does that really play how does that really play out and work because in order to utah democrat a huge heart republicans to convince the rest of their colleagues they have to really convince the voters vote for their colleagues and that my primary their colleagues
into doing in into not supporting primary candidate against their fellow republicans and the reason that's interesting is in this context is that watching mitt romney's behavior from now until
convention in utah will be interesting you remember that mike leigh beat out senator bennett of utah by being the conservative candidate the idea being that washington can pitch leaders had sold out there conservative roots
romney and this is why i think one of the reasons he's running this like super local utah campaign doesn't want to be a national campaign doesn't want to be a
at war with donald trump is he wants to get through his party's nominating convention and then once he does that then we'll see what you know how he changes but the big challenge for your vision is the difficulty with the primary system
that that hold so many other
he's colleagues and there's a there's a less very passionate version on the democratic side it just isn't it isn't the same and the political scientists who looked at it the two parties have gotten more ideological but the republican party since nineteen ninety four has gotten very much more ideological them
democratic party has moved left and has also instituted with the whole structure around it
a group
go way back to nineteen ninety two and bush's signing or nineteen ninety and bush's signing of the of
of the budget where there is a process in place for extricating from the party
those who have gone against party orthodoxy and doing so through the primaries to any there's one aspect of romney running that really troubles me which is that he is a seventy year old running proceed he's going to squeeze out somebody younger mcmullan forget about an over and was thinking of running but i imagine he was thinking of running
isn't that a shame to have somebody that old taking a seat
hatch is already hatches
he's probably eighty five or something rain from me
served two terms will be in his mid eighties bow tie me that of office right
he might be the healthiest man in america right yeah never touched a drop of alcohol doesn't drink coffee and in the most amazing statistic have ever learned the average mormon man that's ten years longer than the average american yeah that's amazing i'm not surprised to hear it they are at their have very clean living folks yeah i mean
and i think related to that point
congress looks nothing like the united states
it is not at all even close to demographically represented as it is older it is more male it is richer it is whiter there been at the same time just a tremendous number of younger candidates and especially women that are signing up to run for office and have been very motivated by the trump presidency to do so
so it's funny running is actually really out of step with that broader trend which i think has a really exciting one that's bringing all of these new candidates and getting them to to to sign up and so he will he'll come into a congress that that will be more female hopefully younger than this current congress has an exaggerated example
of what you see in other states i actually suspect he's just going to romney himself he's going to hate it i don't control what you were saying i'm mentally ill any i think he he's only been executive and his life
he likes being an executive he likes running things the senate is pure posturing it is and that's to me is what actually he's worse than reason why he wasn't elected president
but he's a he's a technocrat and he is a deeply principled percent and so where he i think it might be successful you can imagine him being like a real thorn and mitch mcconnell side and actually refusing to vote for things and last policy changes are enacted and that's the thing is republicans have generally lined up
vote for balance without it's interesting you know there is that that ruby only provision to expand the child tax credit that they didn't actually incest got on that legislation friend stance and i i think i'll be interesting to see how how maverick he he sees their done
can we turn to the overall twenty eighteen picture for democrats because there was a democrats had been feeling extremely optimistic about what was going on until about a month ago and then about a month ago i think there was a sense well american seem to like this tax cut that's gone through and the generic ballot moved back
slightly towards republicans although still heavily in the democrats favor
you know in the last week there's now been a retreat in the president's approval rating i think the generic it is looking slightly more democratic again what's your sense about about where we are
well i i think it's you know to preclude were long way away i think one thing that is still true if we look at the one constant in american politics right now it is that the president is impulsive and
and used consistently engaging in behavior that riles up and access it turned out mechanism for the democratic base and then now we have events doing that as well so you have there's the gun question which will potentially turn out younger voters it also is
it's a very tricky issue for suburban women voters both democrats as a motivator and then for republicans turning them off now you gotta go state by state and look at to places that it's going to matter
north dakota is a different kind of state as your indiana in terms of the size share and number of of suburban women voters so you're gonna be really specific and a lot of these these races the map is still very good for republicans on the senate side you've got a lot of democrats or income is running in red states that president trump one by
big numbers on the other hand it's easier to nationalize a race and a senate race and nationalizing and for democrats means basically using the president so but that's a constant is the extent to which has a turn out mechanism for democrats and they needed in off year elections because their voters tend to turn out and smaller numbers then republicans are it's harder to turn out democrats
the republicans nothing about the tax cut that i wonder about republicans based on the ones i've talked to think that this is going to be the message both hey we delivered on what you want to with tax cuts and don't like democrats because they'll mess everything up i think in and that will be the big counter argument to try to get republicans to turn out which is yes you may not
like the president but you really don't like nancy pelosi they use that successfully in the georgia special but i don't know how that all plays out
that's what i feel i can we actually it any can we dig into an antibiotic question for a second because i find myself genuinely ambivalent about which is clearly a politician of enormous skill she's she's served very effectively and honorably for thirty years
whoever is the democrats leader in the house is going to have a target on her back no matter who it is so obviously the people talk about the pelosi policies leadership if it were person why they would talk about appropriate person wise leadership conservatives denigrate it on the other hand a she's lead the democrats for twelve years i think in the
wisdom versus calif of occasion chart that we all go through effectiveness versus qualification like you know you can really get good and good and good at a job and then at some point you become less good because you're sort of qualified and you're walking away for younger people right i think she should get out she surely is not as effective as somebody who came in and had a great strong seven years and is why the new
york times cycle through its editors at seventy
get some new blood right yeah i mean i think that both at the things that true she is an enormously effective legislator when you go back to that really brief window in which they passed just really remarkable legislation and i think we sometimes forget that has also past can trade you know she she got that
approximately every last one pennsylvania and downs and the track of the guys left mothers
in and fans
every second counts
see the life
remarks on a visiting paid back size of the night
people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars group of people to take them enormously heart valves they passed the affordable care act
the majority and they lost their but you already a porsche which was perhaps inevitable they knew all that i down
slamming shut be at it is true also that she has been there so long that you've repeatedly seen his congressional talent in some cases even just leaving congress because they're not gonna be able to rise up you know i don't think that she's going anywhere i don't know how much she is going to hurt the parties prospect by remaining there i do know how much
he will relish her role as as speaker and and that democrats take back the house i can't even imagine how happy she is going to be and also how fast and nothing that would be her but how fast donald tribes tax returns are quite a row
get leaked wasn't had happened and how can they do it all now
have subpoena power i don't i'm just guessing that that will happen and i'll be really excited in new york state of her force is tax returns and yorkshire it's i actually haven't liked because you know there's been a number of states that have sad that in order to run in the state you have to release your tax return i haven't followed up on what happened with that more broadly in terms of the economic
message i think that republican messaging on its tax bill which was enormously and popular when it passed has actually been really pretty axel and they're going to go to folks and they're going to say you all got a tax cut this year go take a lack the economy is doing better than i'd ever has been since the nineties or whatever and i think it's going to be hard for democrats to count
that message by saying while the tax cut was really for and this is this is completely accurate the tax had primarily benefited corporations and rich people economy is doing well right now in the event that there's any softening and at i think that that's going to be really catastrophic and i'm not sure that republicans are going to have a good answer for that they sort of relying on this kind of quiet
what great economy where people are really starting to get res as to save them some of these kind of controversial seats
let's go to cocktail shatter john when you are
sitting on a in a manhattan speak easy squeaking easily speaking freely what will you be chattering about to your bar side neighbor
i will be chattering about the new book educated by a terrorist over which just came out this week which i read and we had her on the show and it's just it's it's a fantastic book about a woman he grows up in the mountains of idaho her father is a survivalist she was sort of home schooled but mostly she work
to in the in her father's junkyard
it's very well done very well told and story of her essentially escaping from her family and when i found most interesting was it's obviously a super highly particular tale of a of a person who grows up in the house where you have go bags which were
full of supplies and ammunition in case the government came after them the way they did randy weaver it ruby ridge and yet the the crisis she goes through trying to extricate herself through this family which is a fundamentalist mormon family and the insanity she feels she basically goes she has a nervous breakdown
when she she goes to b y u and then ultimately goes to cambridge
the insanity she describes the the wagon the circling of her family and the group felt like it had a lot of echoes with the other stories we've heard of people who are trying to tell their stories about abuse of for form or another
ended up doubting themselves ended up having to fight through weather is the us olympic committee or machine stay in the case of learning answer the olympics doctor or hollywood or any of these other areas where where the media where where people circle the wagons that felt like this particular story offered insight into
that kind of crisis
anyway it's just it's very well done and and a good read any what does your chatter chatter i love the olympics so much and have been utterly delighted the story of elizabeth sweeney who has a member of the hungarian shame
as go after she has gripped her so she got to the olympics both his signing up for all of these half pipe skiing events in which suggest what wouldn't crash and therefore you know she would come in like eleventh or something manages to get to the olympics on the hungarian ski team after i believe they previously she a try
had to get their way with venezuela
mr forman to venezuela skeletons you try to get it skills and ten and how
he's amazing likeable and there's here she puts out there half pipe performance in which she just kind of like makes like a nice per apple and has absolutely no tricks
and it is so delicious and insane and completely crazy let's you just scammed her way into the olympics i love it so much i cannot tell you enough how much i recommend going and watching her run will put a link on the website so that everybody can take in the wonder and it's it's so much funnier
for the fact that she's just careful about it she's like not crashing she's not even trying to do any tricks or anything i cried laughing
and she's i think a despicable person but i'm not really sure i actually tried to run for governor of california wow
must have been a single actually a platform she's she's just somebody who who needs to draw attention to her so she was probably your harvard plus also she remembered as the worse she
definitely
any larry david floods
listener and possibly a little the swimming
i heard it's appalling i i have so many thoughts about that but i'm just going to save them
my chatter one of my problems
really small problem is that i have a hard time falling asleep at night because usually if i want to watch television television and so exciting there's only so much so much drama in anything you want to watch so it's
murder earth like a serial killer the pool with the that pick this week or whatever it is and i get very agitated and so at the end of the evening you want to fall asleep and instead your filled with to buy the the television you've just been watching i have found a solution to that fortunately which is that just happened on planet
earth to
which i never saw planet earth one which sure also get the blender to is the series married by david attenborough about the creatures the earth and divided up into geographical areas there's one about islands which one but desert ceremony but grasslands it is will calm the mind to the spirit
which the spider monkey that spider monkey little spider monkeys are going to fall out of the tree or it going to be rescued by a spider monkey dad is that snow leopard mom and that snow leopard mom and her snow leopard child her snow leopard daughter they can i have a family reunion one day or not what's going to happen
it's just incredible it's beautiful i mean other problems with it it doesn't kind of contemplation climate change it doesn't contemplate the human effect on on these animals lives
and i think it probably invents narratives that it meant story is probably aren't naturally there but it is just gorgeous and incredibly relaxing and hundred or two and good unsuitable for family viewing which is not always you know i mean it's good together the family around and watch that is a good thought
that is or shephard a day the earth is produced by joslin frank or researcher is easy road just and just gave herself a high five that's nice
you can
twitter
fleet ever did you did discover it alive and actually gave have another one thousand two hundred that's like at best for john dickerson and the atlantic's any lowery anything so much please come back
i'm i'm david plots thanks for listening and come to er st louis show on may second like to accomplish live
