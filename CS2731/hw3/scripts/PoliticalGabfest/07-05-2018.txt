david i remember your son was that a love gives us to couple years ago with that new called on him first which i thought was definitely the right move and he had a great question and the hit that's right he did a yeah
heart ache of mothers you think of
all jacobs
my name's sake
we know we don't like publicly
all right
let's start president trump who love
nothing more than a public audition and spent much of the last week very publicly contemplating whom to nominate to succeed just as anthony kennedy and supreme court
trump has been working off a list of twenty five names largely compiled by the federal society which is entirely compound
early
that has become for republican judge picking what consumer reports has become for liberal
and he's cutter yeah with the wire cutter
if don't log role for emily emily company company
there were seven people that he has interviewed oh look i phone or and person two or three people who seem to have risen to the top the list
brett cavanaugh who's an appeals court judge in dc a mechanic barrett who is a newly appointed appeals court and the second circuit
and then catherine
atlanta ga counted legends
yes
kevin on barrett who seemed to be the the front runners are both very young cat nothing's early fifties parrots in her mid forties
i used to play spin on the quiet much longer than she has she's only and then on non and quit for like eight months i think he is to play and used to play basketball with per capita on the late ninety here is an excellent jump shot a very nice guy and a basketball court don't know what it's like
the other court but emily why are those two folks in particular at the top of the list like can't tell if they're really at the top of the list or just if they provide all of us with a useful way of thinking about the different the slightly different profile so amy county there is a recent applying to of the court interestingly she's not
from an ivy league background she's not from harvard or yale which that would be a big refreshing addition to the court she is deeply religious she's gotten attention for this particular catholic group she's an which uses terms like head of household for men and handmade i think they stopped but they didn't tell reason
also i don't think it's catholic it's not it's a moose harris had a randy which is moving and i right
which actually when you read about sounds kind as that sounded like a kibbutz yeah except that i think they're super and to men being different tale and lots of ways in the head of household way which made me slightly nervous i've been watching too much of the handmade its tail so anything that smacks of that right now gets me agitated unnecessarily said
apps and any case and bad had this well publicized exchange with sen dianne feinstein at her appellate court on confirmation hearing is in which finds time was going after her over an essay she rode in which barrett said she thought that some catholic judges like justice brennan he was
on the court previously should recuse themselves from some death penalty cases because of their catholic beliefs and this became fodder for feinstein saying to her your dog my lives loudly within you is really unfortunate phrase and i think it was all just like a very clumsy handling of this question of on
how one's ideological or religious beliefs should inform ones judging on you know berets think the choice of the religious conservatives because she seems perfectly positioned to be totally determined to go after roe vs wade and other presidents and
then back cavanaugh is the guy was on can stars prosecutorial team then the clinton era he has more of an established rack or and about deferring to executive authority on and i think he would also be an anti abortion vote strongly and that these are basically manufacture and differences for the most part i mean
i guess there's someone something slightly interesting about whether a temp isn't really going to pick another white man on or we'll go with a woman or there's one indian american on the last recently appointed to the sixth circuit amo far so i guess there's a slightly interesting question about race and gender and whether chomp really wow
wants to a point another a white man like me al gore such but i don't know this i find this stage of the process to be always kind of tedious because it's one thing to go through the records of the appellate court judge or whoever it is after you know who that person is in another to go through like three or six or nine
twelve of them and try it
parse out the slight differences one point to note about cabinet which i
from shocking upon discovering it is that cavanaugh is fifty three years old grew up in suburban washington new course which i think it's fifty two years old grew up in suburban washington may went to the same very small catholic prep school too pricey
and they're both of
nice looking white guys from very prosperous middle class upper class backgrounds and in suburban washington that there was a prep school notable i would say for having a campus which is unusual even by prep school can or way so there's actually some things interesting about that which is that this a narrow world that
a federalist society has drawn from i mean this makes a mechanic berets you know notre dame rose college resume stand out but again in terms of what these people are actually going to be like on the court that's a different question than in terms of been reliable hard line conservative and votes i think everybody trump is considering appears to fit into the
that frame marc jacobs barrett has
says hospice non ivy league background she has seven children including two adopted from haiti she very religious and
eloquent about it
why on earth wouldn't trumpeter she seems like a no brainer given all the most there's something or mental she does seem like a no brainer but i think we're getting too quickly into the hair splitting about the anomalies in the close reading of the law review articles and who would do what i think that's a more primary issue here which i wish the democrats
go back to which is they owe us a seat
they stole seed for america and when they wrongly blocked a nomination by barack obama and democrats should have fought a retaliatory fight core such but they didn't and they should do it now with this nominee and they will lose that fight almost certainly but i think they will
benefit from making the i think for benefit from several ways one i think it's i think it's valid and there's a strong argument and it's just an eye for an hour a day to one of ours were going to take one of theirs until until the scores even to i think it's something that's going to energize the base and i don't think the conventional way of fighting which has to
try to find chinks in the armor of the nominee
strategy where you try to find personal stuff or you simply try to argue conventionally the nominee is too extreme and outside the mainstream and wrote this one more of your article or gave this one interview where they said something that sound stodgy i mean all of that is really pretext for what democrats mean which is we don't think there should be another
conservative republican on the bench and in particular that donald trump doesn't deserve to nominate want and there is a can they can they can at least block someone to after the election right i mean they're they're only one vote down in the senate i think there are a couple of republicans who are vulnerable from democrat
challenge to susan collins and lisa murkowski in particular who are amenable to persuasion john mccain may not vote it's not impossible that they can block and nominate i think you're right
lot of reasons one is that extreme sophistication and skill of the vetting process by the federalist society so the days of rag oh david souter what a surprise he betrayed his core conservatives constituency this is our over and so the chinks in the armor are likely to be relative
a few and not all that compelling i'm in now is what happened with me i'll course sets from the point of view of the democrats and so i think you're right that it is the over arching argument i'm skeptical about how receptive cons and murkowski will be that argument i mean listening to collins and last week
if you really want her to be a champion for anything other than confirming trumps nominee you'd want her to be saying stuff she's not saying i mean this is a person who voted for every single trump lower court nominee and she said last week which thanks john roberts when overturn roe vs wade which made me think all she cared about was like the technical
question of whether it was actually i've returned to had no interest in whether it's gutted because robert voted for the
send a few years ago in the case out of texas with all of taxes is regulations that would have effectively ended or close to ended access to abortion and a whole bunch of states anyway but i think you're right that the democrats need to rally for their own political sake as balls the substance at issue here and
no and put cards and murkowski his feet to the fire
usually argument at hand i mean it's definitely use would use row with wisconsin murkowski it's going to what's going to sway them they're not going to be swayed by having argument that republican shouldn't get to pick the next supreme court justice until after after the election at least but i just think what i mean is that they should have a hammer and tongs all out fine
i'd in which they're unified position is we will not support trumps nominee and they can say that nominee for very nice person qualified that's not the issue but jager game out how that actually works as a practical strategy i understand the rhetorical desire
in fact for democrats do not control the santa paid
now essentially majority vote in the senate so variable are unable to filibuster their their capacity to resist is simply to delay by refusing unanimous consent
cent of action which i suppose that can do and to make here in his last as long as i can make them last but they have no capacity to stop of vote no but they they could possibly winner
i mean if john mccain doesn't vote and if they pick up to republican votes and lose no democratic votes they win the i mean this is the argument against any equipment that that's that's a that's doing on the substance that are doing on the reason you say which is trumped does not deserve to get know nothing but if you want to be if you want to make an exam
parallel you have to prevent vote you can do that but i think you can vote no on the basis that america island didn't get a vote right okay but but that's different from saying we're actually going to
stall i guess
voted the argument a critic than but should they try to reject the nominee quickly or try to reject the nominee slowly is it better for this to last pass the election and be it be something that galvanizes republicans to vote or for them to lose have a new conservative justices supreme court by election day and use that to get democrats are too
and and do what they really need to do which is when back part i think they should try to win i think there is a chance that they could defeat a nominee i think as you try to do that and they should make it as long as painful as possible including withholding unanimous consent which were like and other it as as i mean that's the sort of nuclear well hey is in that time because we use it for other things
but that seems to be the only real structure of our they have but i don't know what you're talking about this little last week and john thought that balance like a bridge too far i'm all in favor of that i mean i don't know exactly what gets held up when but what's more important than this you know i mean this is so it's going to hold up the budget for homeland security for another
month i think they can deal with that you know i think they've gotta this is the kind of tactic that republicans have been so willing to use and the democrats have always defaulted to put their public responsibility on and i think if there's ever a time to make a stand this the to me the long term golf congressional democrats to regain a congressional majority if they recognized
they don't have the votes to stop a truck nominee
try to lose quickly or should they try to lose so you're not hearing me i think they shouldn't try to lose it all i mean i think i think they're likely to lose i think that's a that's a valid prediction but i don't think it's certain they're gonna lose i think there is a chance that with people in the streets with with with the base energize with people as upset and angry
the about what's happening in say should be that they can defeat trump first nominee
at least push the issue until after the election
do do you have a sense about whether there are get a bowl or convert
i'm pretty pessimistic because this is the like this is trumps best play it's the thing he's done the most successfully and smoothly and his presidency and i think the pressure from the republican base to have this victory is going to be huge and i have yet to see says and collins like really a single time
time and the term presidency actually stand up to republicans a block something from happening she gets a lot of mileage out of gesturing in that direction and claiming bipartisanship but in terms of actually doing it she talked about trying to come to san diego to save parts of obama care and in the end she voted against obama care and the affordable care act
like she has voted for all these lower court nominee she voted for gore said i just that isn't to say that you know the democrats and and pressure our or that she couldn't lose her next election if that's i mean if you are a pro choice person in maine and susan collins votes for the person who effectively takes away acts
yes to abortion or much of the country like that is a broken promise me she holds the right to legal abortion in her hands yeah and those steak should be made clear to everyone and she she in the end of the issue will make whatever choice she makes about that but she shouldn't be allowed to slip out
the news by saying oh with the judge assured me that he that he or she believes in precedent they and what we seem to be heading toward his her child to head off a nominee like amy county barrett who's going gonna make her snake kirk's collins look bad and hypocritical from the start that someone like back haven't is in my view just as likely
to do the work of gutting row and so you know the fact that he's not quite on the record in such a clear way should not be the thing that makes a difference even though she's going to claim that it is i mean that just shows you the correct haven't i've been thinking about being on the supreme court for the past thirty years and he's not even all that clean i mean the dc circuit
just had this case are cases of undocumented immigrants in the custody of the office of refugee resettlement and there were a couple under age girls at least a couple who wanted to have abortions and the current administration was refusing to tell sarah tate their access to
doctors there was a lawsuit and cavanaugh said that he didn't think that these girls should get these abortions he just didn't go quite as far as one of his colleagues who also decided to rattle her saber about how well is unconstitutional but like as you said jake up that was a smart strategy on his part and also
pointless to go on about that in a moment where like row still is the law
if you took emily nine relatively intelligent lawyers from around the country even nine that had just gone to harvard and yale law school is that record and you briefed all the supreme court cases and courthouse would they sort themselves ideologically the way that justices
sort themselves were there in fact if you just took any random sampling of lawyers would you end up with a conservative block and a liberal block that voted consistently together across most of the critical cases or would that not happen is that that is it that there really are two species in lawyers generally or it's just that the ones who end up going to this
hurt or have to be in one of these two species all sell remember that most of the cases that go to the supreme court t not divide five for conservatives to liberals sprayed i mean there are a lot of cases like thousands of federal cases in the country and even dozens in front of the supreme court where there is an answer that often comes from the text of this
statue or precedent
earning prior case law that's pretty obvious and they mostly agree on it it is true that goes nine zero like a whatever people just lately but it doesn't divide in his ideological way the problem are two sets of cases one sat are cases in which there is just no clear legal answer like the right to abortion it is
not written in the constitution now we have the right so you have to buy into some interpretation of either the right to privacy which is what row is based on or equal rights for women which is what ruth bader ginsburg wishes and i wish that row or based on rape there are these capacious phrases in the constitution due process equal rights
they can mean a lot of things or they can mean very little and then the second area of cases that have tended to divide this way and this is perhaps more troubling are cases in which there is just a statute it issue and yeah we see this ideological division which does seem more suspect so this term
the ohio case about what ohio can do to purge it's voting rules that was based on these two laws it was about how the motor voter law lined up against the subsequent law that congress passed to regulate elections i tried for a while to look at those provisions and decide how they
together didn't go together it was really hard i couldn't come up with like absolutely this is the slam dunk answer and so what the law professors on both sides who are like following long were doing was arguing which side gets the presumption should you should you basically like defer to the notion that you kicking people off
rolls with a process that starts just with them not voting seems out of the spirit or do you say no i don't care about that and just like look at the statutes and say well there's no clear answer so ohio can do it at once and that's where you see people play a more partisan political farm on the scale and indeed that case came down five to four it's evidence
versus liberals in favor of ohio's voter purge no constitutional principle at stake just statutory and didn't really answer my question know it
well then let me take another stab at it which is to say that increasingly we see a core that behaves ideologically in cases of just like reading the text of laws in addition to filling in effectively like the blanks in the constitution but you would every republican who requested to every problem
appointed to my shadow supreme court and voting for her yeah i think they would because they would have a choice right you can if you can make a plausible argument in two directions then it seems increasingly and or maybe the increasingly is not quite right some con la scala can argue with me but we are certainly seen
evidence right now where if there are two possible interpretations the republican appointees the conservatives pick the one that favors their results and the democrats pick the one the favors their solved and so yeah i think that any of your lawyers who got appointed unless they had some really well developed a theory of like judicial modesty are some
thing that got them out of making these decisions would be making similar calls so post members you get bonus arguments on another so i pod cast

abolish ice is a new rallying cry on the left push by alexandria causing cortez in her and surgeon campaign adopted by christian job brand a couple of other sitting democratic legislators
become both a slogan and a great divide for democrats on the farther progressive left
there are those who would eliminate immigration and customs enforcement and reset how we handle those migrants living among us who don't have a legal right to be here who make less para military what's vicious on the less progressive left but still the lift there are those who had merely reform ice by basically doing the same things but by eliminating the organization i suppose so
where did abolish come from and is it a good idea from a policy perspective in and it a good slogan for me slogan perspective
it's i think it's a terrible slogan and a slot idea i think it's a terrible slogan because democrats through the party that upholds public service and government agencies and it seems to me that we don't want to get into the conservatives game of saying whole swath
of the government are unnecessary or do something or malicious in some way i think ice badly needs to be reformed as does the c p b which actually guards the border in the division of labor from what used to be the old i nfc immigration nationalization service but fundamentally is an issue
policy
left problem is with donald trump policy of deportations separating families of everything he's doing around immigration it should not be with the individuals who serve the government in any capacity including law enforcement and i just think that's i think it's a mugs game for the democrats
i do think on the just a bit on the other side of it that
positive phenomenon here is the energy and ideas coming from the last of the party the democratic party i think now is is increasingly coming to resemble the republican party in the early eighties and in the reagan years lots of those ideas seemed extreme excessive
beyond the pale of of the political discussion
and you know but they drove the party and a lot of more bad ideas
but they captured the party because they captured people's imaginations and they won't get people excited about being on that side that sort of abolished isis is typifies in a way the same phenomenon the liberal side and the phenomenon is good i mean the democrats need that energy the
they need those ideas i think they just don't need this particular framing but in the overton window theory of of policymaking is it good to have loose extreme and in your view bad idea out there so that makes it more likely you get the less extreme and better version of reform ice or should they not even raise it because it is
in itself so bad that what if they catch that they catch that postal truck
and may do have to apologize they should just in different slogan six i do abolish sounds like you don't believe in any immigration enforcement which certainly hasn't been democratic policy and isn't democratic policy that very few democrats like the democrats who would support the idea that there should be no verge
the device that there should be no deportations and all that there should be no immigration enforcement and again it just it's the democrats attacking part of part of the government i don't think they should be doing that i think they should have a slogan that moves the debate the moves the argument but i don't think they want to move it in that way
i take your point about that bars part but on the other hand i never thought the department of homeland security was a good idea like the history of this is after nine eleven it looked like it was true that are bore borders were a frighteningly porous and you know everybody got together on a bipartisan base
says and created this new agency and it's always been kind of an alarming power center and the fact that ice is it's own bang which is doing mostly picking people up for you know dealing with detention and deportation within the country but also gets mixed up in the border patrols with c p
has insulated ice from a lot of the kinds of reforms that we want i'm not actually sure that this governmental structure that was created in two thousand and three is serving the country's interest while and it was of course created to prevent you know terrorists from coming in and now it's like mostly this weapon that we used again we use
against people from latin america so there's like a more thing of the mission that's been problematic to so for that reason i wonder if it really is such a problem for progressives to be complaining about a part of the government i mean you know the rule should i can see before d h s i n s i mean you listen to this shitty was it or was this like
i was going to use the word well positioned ones any under obama either there's was pretty bad but not as did you read that an interview with minions who who supervised it obama and edwards
had different directives it was less paramilitary yeah
exactly they a the years and that's it that's their job is david immigration lawyers the issue is policy it's not it's not the agency per se and it's certainly not the people who work for the agency they will follow the policy said at the top what they're being told right now is to be arbitrary aggressive
brutal unfair
and now the it's like it's like attacking the police for enforcing laws you don't like the police the police will follow the policy that said wait a second thought because police unions and this has been true also of the organization that represents a lot of agents are also lobbyists who take
political positions and affect the debate and the ice like representative organization was a big trump backer and that and i mean i can't remember the name of the had a vet who was on tv a lot but he was out there back in trenton so yes it is true i mean i'm against attacking individual people who work for the government including law enforcement but i also think
i have to recognize the way in which these groups of government actors are not simply doing their jobs they're also a political force well that's true that's true
i don't think you could say the same thing about the firemen and police and emergency workers in new york you know who are the backbone of giuliani support them and it's not that these people don't have political views
and don't and don't represent them but they they perform a function that we are generally uncomfortable with a mean even when it was the ins with this was never a beloved agency of government they were sort of in a way saved by their incompetence and bureaucracy they weren't good they weren't good and
warning people but they weren't very good at helping people with their legitimate immigration problems either and i'd rather go back to the kind of i n s three d h s model where you have something that is that is more oriented toward helping people
come to the country and become citizens legitimately than it is focused on the random enforcement of of deportations to so triggered gone back to your original framing of this
one thing that conservatives had enormous amount of success with the years is the abolish the iris
idea
like an insane idea which most republicans don't sign onto him to they still want taxes collected in some way most people want to be collected roto with fairly but as an emotional pull on people that was very effective
certain on a certain class of conservative ideologues who would then get out and why isn't the same argument true here for abolish ace setting aside your point like the democrats should support government and government institutions working well but since attacks on their parents were absolutely disgusting i mean these people who work they were from the iris they are
they were they were totally disgusting but they were lose on politically effective for republicans well i mean i think i think a motive i think they probably were you know in the show trials these hearings they had with i i r s agent supposedly testifying anonymously behind curtains i mean they created or you know all of the theater around the idea
what the i did was fundamentally unfair when what the as does is fundamentally necessary and good to any civilized society i mean i just don't see how you can say well that worked so it's something you want a copy in may have worked lots of lots of forms as demagoguery work i think demagoguing against the pay
patriots who worked for the federal government is not a form of demagoguery the democrats want to touch i'm not saying they shouldn't try to be political and populist and figure out how to frame issues but if if they start picking off the parts of the government data like and attacking them i think you know you're just going to create this this pitched battle that is
even now at an acceleration or an escalation of the kind of political fighting were having any even essentially you were having a similar conversation the me or talking about before an overarching theme of what does it mean to fight and what are you fight like how and i think the left is generally full of this conversation right now
how far you go is exaggerated rather act perfectly fine as long as it presents a tactical advantage because all you're doing is expanding the overton window you don't really mean abolish ice so who cares or as you're arguing do you create a snake really corrosive set of rhetorical points you're making
you know erode the quality of the democracy and the government in this way and that has longer term ramifications we don't really know the answer and you can see different commentators on the left kind of trying to figure out or like flirting with ideas that a few years ago i think they would have been really uncomfortable and part of it is this moment it feels like extreme extremity
he is like throwing anything the spaghetti against the wall is helpful and aware that we could wind up feeling really regret about heard democrats thirty learn this lesson i mean they know that you can you can criticize the defense budget but you don't attack the troops you know or you don't attack the idea that we should have a defense budget or the three
and i think this is a version of that it's not quite it's not quite the same trigger but it's just it makes things too easy for republicans trees it's too easy for donald trump to say what you don't want border enforcement you want open borders and you know i think some of the some of the people on the left thing as do one open border though not
the elected representatives right that's more like you know people lefties as opposed to like people in congress but it lets the right associate would really have fringe marginal position with the mainstream of the party that doesn't hold that and for that reason i think it's a bit about idea
i mean it is telling that be focus which for a week because good strong week was really on camera separation but the attention of families through the grotesque wicked enforcement of policy the refusal to accept asylum seekers
all of the things all of the truly horrible crimes that are being committed in our name on the border is now that it's been defused to there's some still some discussion of that but there's all this there's the apologize part of it there's trumps response to abolish it doesn't feel like the democrats have a cogent message about this and that they had lost the
we're both moral and policy advantage they have when they were talking about the really wicked things that were going on and which are the things that need to be stopped
i agree with you that's that's exactly right if you were going to have a slogan that was to abolish some federal agency
today
richard neither of you people will take up as against the argument about holidays gonna ever keep the secretary keep the department of commerce is a promotional of a wilbur ross's investment interest department
yeah i mean you know it's funny every agencies even even the crummy ones contain stuff
hundred and yourself it is i mean you know the department of commerce does you know is the
the eno a in the senate sense
i don't believe so much and all of the businesses stuff that does that if there's a lot of other stuff keeping gets new can pick a small agency you can pick you can pick the department of sugar substitutes just to drive you crazy david i'm going to say nasa
i don't really i think that that c'mon
i've get a rather that okay oh no it's really not and i thought
gatti or nay it was chuckling i'm sure their part of the department of transportation or required to get rid of there must be it department of transportation office of asphalt me as mainland is important you want more car crash oh you think that should be a federal a federal court all
i know now i really think the department of homeland security is like the most questionable part in the way it's consider it
yeah had it is having just come back in the country if different procedures that it is really shocking to come back and the country how difficult it is to get back into your own country when you're a citizen imagine if you're interested in and if you're a visitor

on the record it is not take was often scott who must have said some kind of guinness book of world records for ethics investigation is out there is a p administrator who were subject to at least a dozen possibly as many as eighteen separate investigations of his chiseling cheating and chicanery
this grotesque corruption is misuse of public funds as misappropriation of employee time is nepotism
he is finally gone so we actually caped a segment on thursday morning
emily grey up and i all about prude but with the assumption that was continuing to be paid administrator that he left and so emmeline i have come back this afternoon to quickly grapple with the news that it is gone
family is on a subway as we take this so please excuse any audio quality issues and and please excuse the absence of jake who who was not able to join us for this emily are you surprised that got hurt
finally finally finally finally left is a vindication for journalism or just a sign of how incredibly lower standards are since he should have been gone months ago i right
current that he added all or negative it either
we are leaving are wrong and i know about you
yes i agree with that and i think he hit become he was no longer that useful because andrew wheeler his deputy has all the same good qualities as far as conservatives are concerned or bad quality far as liberals are concerned and will be just as effective a carrying out the the policy
that it was but he doesn't as far as we know is not a chancellor and and a cheat in the way it is so why he was no longer necessary my character and
finally went and on nightmare
arctic that happened
why do you think
you need a problem
i mean
i think that the over well mean corruption in his cabinet and his administration will be a problem so it's obviously not simply peru peru is the most histrionic example of of a cheese learn a cheat and the cabinet but there are others wilbur ross is currently
asian the largest active political insider trading probably the largest political corruption in history in the history of a cabinet member and so you have ross you have devolved there are some shady stuff ben carson their shady stuff everywhere you look in this administration there is swamp penis and i think democrats will probably
people to run against it even with gone
he right
had a general want in a while he meant that out
at any rate i don't know andrew wheel or who succeeded him
his
no was a huge lobbyist for coal and gas i think an oil company so so it's very much a fox in charge of hand house situation still wheelers wheelers very much in the same school of peru it and i don't think we're going to see in policy terms i don't think is going to be a better place
but i guess but i suppose yes yes it's it's good that the that the manifestly corrupt person has finally been driven from office and presumably will be a to your low bar yeah what of all the kind of bit of corruption that was implicated and from the chick fillet franchise he tried to get for his wife to my
favorite recent one they putting of personal expenses on his junior staffers credit cards and they're not paying them back
do you think there's any one that broke the camel's back to think there's only one that made trump say it like you know what this is a bridge too far you could have you can have three point five million dollars and security but you can't have those commemorative tens
it up
tried to get a job
damn and bad people who are either
i mean
nobody could right
about you i think it is the enlisting in security staff to go around to go to hotels to get lotion the special brand of reroute motion and that was that was a doozy i mean the worst with the one that i felt worst about the one was worse for the public spending ways to money on security so that's the worst for the public yeah but the one
the one that reflected the loan this of character was the making his aides put things on their personal credit cards and not paying that back i mean that your current credit
and getting the matters and the term hotel to the pathetic and cute more than i found that damaging that that was just it was just weird and pathological it was but it didn't hurt anybody in the same way those other won't hurt people
i like our part emily you're on a subway and it's very hard to have this conversation with glee and length would like to sew
cut it off here
fox and every one pencils and uncles the gas

people of pennsylvania taxpayer dollars let's go to kill chatter when you're sitting overlooking a superfund site near you watching the sunset have been a post pruitt cocktail jacob weisberg what are you going to be chattering about david i was just going to mention a magazine article i loved which was by jacket in the recent issue of the york times magazine
which was a fantastic gone about this renegade james joyce scholar and this was a guy who became a huge on font reveal in the literary world on because he said basically the big addition that was published of ulysses with with it was supposed to correct all the mistakes with
filled with all these mistakes and he wrote this devastating article i think in the new york with books or something and he got an academic appointment out of the sky was like the star of joy studies and then he went missing like he went off the map of and honesty failed to write his own like complete definitive list right i never get nothing
for he was going to work on the definitive critical edition which he disappeared within right and jacket the writer of this piece sound him down and brazil and has it's a great i won't i won't spoil it sounds great
it's a fantastic story of a magazine long form magazine writing is all about emily what is your chatter i'm a big fan of the fiction pod cast the new york or puts out said this is the one that deborah treatment is a fiction added our does where she asks a different radar every month to pick a story that the new yorker public
best buy another writer and sell deborah trees man has and conversation with the invaded right are a kind of start they introduced the story then then invaded raider weeds the story on with more or less scale but plenty of scale and my view and then they talk about at the end and i don't always make it through this
stories some stories are actually hard to list at least for me hard to follow on the audience but when i get into it i love this pod cast and recently the writer a m homes read a margaret atwood story called stone mattress
head and hands is reading the story it came back to me so vividly it's from two thousand and eleven i know that i read it at the time and it's one of these stories that was written in a slightly different moment but resonate so much with this me to champion moment we're having and resonates with the show the
handmade talent i think i already brought up embarrassingly but anyway it's just really cool story and the conversation that treatment and homes have a it to affect so it's the june episode of that section pod cast for the new yorker that is a great part guess they'll of catching up on those on long drives exactly it's all about what people pick the pair that
choices are so interesting lane or see i completely agree and you can always go back to old like it doesn't raid it's not something that's perishable my chatter
to to quick things first of all i'm reading bad blood the john kerry you i think whatever you say your name
book about the thoroughness long con
it's a best seller many of you probably already read it if you haven't read it it's wonderful
absolutely delightful book about
some con artists and how they got away with a with an exceptional con for many many years and
it's great it's a deep inside portrait of this the silicon valley darling and how it was completely corrupt from the start and criminal psych give all of our at least i felt so much respect for john kerry i mean elizabeth homes
founder and erstwhile ceo of fairness was getting just such amazing media coverage and carry less skeptical and he took her down and it was not easy they get fairness when after han just isn't a real story of like basic incredibly intelligent
analysts on and you know get so much a risk or brought to justice and yes precisely and it has had actually his and his employer rupert murdoch
a huge investment
and yet care you went forward and and murdoch what the peace corps for or deaths so that was also brave anyway the book is just fantastic i left my reading and haven't quite finished year and then my second conditions the opposite so i watch a lot of television and there's a bit of trashy leave the probably none of you and maybe none of our listeners
wash but if you were looking for a sex and the city
suitable air to sex in the city there's a show called the bold type which is a show about three young women who work at a magazine which is basically a cosmo and edited by basically a cold can executive producer on the show it's unbelievably trashy and yet because i have a teenage daughter and so watch it
it is such a pleasure to watch it is it's just very very funny about journalism and about magazines and then it's about the mores of young women i love it
the whole type with on some some cable network that i shouldn't even
family guy
it's under
that is i show for today the political office is produced by estimable just than frank a researcher is the beard it easy rude i'm no longer bearded so is he has the only beard and the true i didn't even know ness i just got very frustrated yes fez really it's so hot i just like
scrape it off but i'll probably just perfect
because i now i feel like a naked mole rat you can follow us on twitter at at slate gab best for emily basil on and jacob weisberg who was always such a good guest
