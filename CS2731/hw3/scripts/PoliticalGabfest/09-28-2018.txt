we are well drain on this we've got our first we're going to give the whole show over to be astonishing hearing in the senate judiciary committee all day
that's going to be all we're going to talk about it was a historic and strange and grueling day for all of us
we will also do to talk to chatter and and will have a slight plus what we'll talk a little bit about john's trip to england that interview with the prime minister of great britain before we get started oh just want to quickly announce from from the you know
be somber to the the extremely frivolous we will be doing our conundrum show on december twelfth that the screwball center and why you
tickets that play dot com slash lie but it's always the funnest live show we do in the year will be a very joyful distracting and interesting event we will discuss whether it is insulting to get somebody the gift a cleaning service

so let's start with you i think everyone who's listening to the show on all of us spent the day
glued to the television and i should note that i stopped watching
for just during ted cruz's question and so it was almost at the very end so i didn't see the very end of what happened to if something happened in the last five minutes
i missed it and i don't know if you guys to too
what did you make just first of all do you make of of the day
wow
oh weird
and no no money in front of motel
i don't know about you
morning
all
pride in doctor bobby orr mani re outta we got a ball and
oh wow i care
remarkable and bucket
i've been thinking about our all identity
wow it up i felt
the proper to you it back
i may have been incorrectly to her or airway
oh analyze our debt
at the trauma and know
it hadn't yet that were know that were the morning and it
obama up and an airy are we really are
denied the ballot
want a part it on
and let me repeat out of the
women who made break eight
you
people can look at me i'm at and
pumping it or it happen and you can be hundred our very out on her ball and not believe that one actually acne or you know i think that hard at it hard to deal with macmurray at me
doubt op
anyway
about a nickel
non profit
john what's what do you come away with from the hearing with
dr horde
you know for me
well i got her
extraordinary not going beyond what you knew airport
even make sure he didn't get an educated and currently undergoing pointed out
we're done in here but i think when you have an expert in it
like i and being an expert witness on the nature of promote it
usually don't get don't get
get bad and i got a great burning question you know
in what could all about her credibility and why shouldn't be credible that it would be a roadblock formation elevation to job
elevation or cabinet or treat for pod
who are who are upper grad here
came out and gave that variant
i thought he earned a man with incredibly passionate our then he basically maintain that level
but he what
area emotional pain
what of anguish and then i think in and or it got a little eat branded upbeat
and what i'm trying to figure out a lot of people
we're we're not and eight
the way a person
you'll be about being caught would be paid
then would be different from person to person would be paid and eight up they were totally being wrongfully it
appreciate what you're going to you
the behavior of that you would describe would include people a one hundred percent thirty something and i lack the capacity and at our air
it can hurt orient
or a bottle
when he
any club or daughter old everyone the daughter of a of an all like whether she had blacked out
a weird
em and get brittle net which you know after going through what he like you've gone through maybe that we could add a little great and allow for that on the other hand
weird own only
talking now
i did think and emily let's let's go to some of these credibility questions around cavanaugh that's the most recent thing that i've spent time thinking about it because the morning now seems to have been a month ago so he was adamant about denying things which seemed pretty obvious that he he referred to this year book
references been is not and all been derogatory about this young woman who was clearly been interrogated in a t denied ever having possibly drunk and such a way that he might have been fuzzy your loss control he said he suggested the words didn't mean what we know they meant do you generally down play
aid and potential for for understanding him as having been alcoholic or been somebody who could have misbehaved and all of that it seemed to me he was working very hard to try to ensure that he didn't concede any ground on this question of
ever been fuzzy
could there be something which i've forgotten
and he wasn't leaving a tiny shred of opening around that and that caused him to lie about things right
really really on corporate banking there
yeah right i mean he hadn't heard that why the arctic that are ellen
that and wreck way not why but no it wouldn't go at being a great happy and women add one
a democrat and i think that would mark what to call hard way but all of them
right at me in
eight than outdoor man that he couldn't really give any around on on you know on
ow
reference your buck
and then
money or at the right
but a court order to crack open a new holiday at all like oh no room for any a bad in that picture
up and now i'm very much it odd with another director of that people a new combat
going for that all out right i mean with another article on and that the more you know yeah i drank a lot and i don't remember everything but i think he decided to go that that would not be him and he want about it
out and that he couldn't do it or whatever he you happening on that way
oh the lead up or down on denial with the very grumpy and raid on about it
yeah go for our bit and for me
really it really raining migratory about the right way to it
well he made it is possible that he had an episode where he was quite drunk didn't remember what happened early has the easiest memory and therefore actually genuinely believes that that what she described didn't involve him
suddenly back to our no it and he added an you for him he a you admit it back to be a possibility and know we're left with that he had program without him fell in with you know honey in iraq the lake
at odds with all these other women or make him the app
the very good
brutal about the question of drinking
could be clear from a book from going on through your page
a trend
judge that bit
we gotta be the arbiter give any quitting on the political attack can we bringing up the cliff
i think with let your republican questioners do all that you can wait
when he can't have that his daughter praying for doctor ford and he talked about what the couldn't case or patient family and family's the most emotionally powerful why get into all the part of the stops let them at the politicians do that they're gonna do it why he why that helpful key or breed
eikenberry cut down on how your pocket going to be a fair and impartial guides when you get the bank and you have liberal cognitive
clint gift and democrat than you
yes but i see to use planes
because audience was two sets of people one was the president who did not want to present to yankees nomination or city was weak and and to the was very much plane to the president and then i think he was playing to the men on that committee in is very canny way i thought it was an incredibly effective performance
for those to audiences for the men
he is for trump he was his indignation his denial his aggressiveness about his aggressiveness towards the question he was something which which we know trump responds to in the respects admirers and that kind of
i concede no territory attitude is is very empty and and he's very sympathetic to the and in terms of the the the senders themselves i think they also saw themselves and have and saw the sense like oh my god i could be subject to this and look and he standing up for his honor and the way that
i would stand up for my honor i think they were the white male republican senators were very very strongly identify with them and and that is exactly why they took back the questioning midway through it's like they suddenly recognizable i want to be associated with this guy i don't need to i don't
need to protect myself anymore in the way i did in the morning but i don't want to be on record asking any questions about this i don't want to a computer doctor policy for it suddenly they realize you know what this guy is going places i want to be with him i want to get on the side of it and it was and the is going to like it i totally agree and then and quiet play
egg that you or your and them or county and i guess if he and ray or air hand you make them per year
the other already a panther and are now behind you back
i would cry and i think they are totally right about it
i play
exactly articulated by graham artillery garnett who get arrogant who do what the question
added
oh and that territory you know ukraine the question you win and lindsey graham but it could be good for any republican thinking about voting it will be a vote or character that nation
trying to shift from you believe doctor board
you are you okay doing it to him and or
sorry work out in our an extra hour of that bear
a matter for corcoran quake or leave it but bait voter in their state are getting a queue program
detroit
making and increasing the pain threshold
am from republican keeping the way to work on i think you're totally right about it grand prix retraining and court but it leaves out
we're all the people and our men that were gay
by air
at one end of it
economic her neck when he rebut yeah i'm he rebut yeah i'll end up drinking it currently neck dream neck that arctic arctic it far outnumber at thing you know the f b i investigate and that did not happen that one would presumably want
about finding a true
and about clearing your name i mean i think that with birds were the questions
the cannot like damned around if not then think about today and then thing mark guide the friend who would probably back up ah but cock back because you're going during game
vagrant me on a record that he republican atlanta and in a room on be a believe big out all of bone
pete are and factor that we can narrow it down there quite between character it back and eight that that think about actor and back and eighth amendment graham want could be the one thing about yard
to me what you animated film like well even the brand but you know i'm going to it that trend
but but
dr
them in a room a kid and didn't i mean he didn't make up one thing about it
our boat
whatever happened if not i mean you can be eleventh hour
democratic operative no one can create a narrative like that
right
put hoarding cabin on been room
why people i mean
making that connection
and connect him to the guy who wrote the book about her drunk
that bad it an incredible
he could information that know what a with by on that
god you're much make it all the more important you add in their current bill right and also the fact that that calendar which which town i was so
indignant about and and system to bed indicated there was on july first a party and which judge and tavern and the other people that the doctor for named we're we're at a party at a different place
and so there there's there's so much in her story that the
speaks to truth or scenario or is was confirmed by other
dig ancillary evidence i mean we'll obviously never know but judge judges absence was extraordinary and the and the way i said democrats were very inefficient and ineffective at making a big deal about his absence and the senate can force him to come testify they chose not to because the majority wouldn't wanna but it's pretty amazed
the judge has been allowed to stay on this ridiculous statement that he made one thing about been morning that i wonder why you think about that
the art of gravity or not not what he back backpack
in trying to cut back your bet ignorant come on out remember being at that party gargan mean it didn't happen no reagan that it would have been memorable for the people there already
oh we don't have her hand or operating went and air with that
you're going to try to in a way i don't think there cannot be edited year
i'm an avid i think back your all
like helping hand
but i didn't i assume you guys sit in the same exercise that i've done which is to think back like book was i like fifteen i think of episodes when i was fifteen and you can think you can call to mind the things that were most
amazing your difficult or shocking but almost everything else is just a mass like it's a vague sense memory or something that happened there something that happened there but you don't you couldn't with any accuracy say it would happen on the state or with these people it's only eat there a few very specific things you could call to mind which were particularly traumatic or
particularly exciting and so the chances that anybody else would remember that party that event like how anyone got their what happened is doctor for never said anything about it is nil no one would remember that so it's not at all surprising that nobody remembers the right
right and and we know about the way the brain
emily brought up a week ago and we add
show claiming that you know when you have a moment of calm might create even valuable but not an early broad memory and then regular old people in their memory
that may and
yeah john to that and i thought the most astonishing moment in doctor for testimony was that description of the last or the glorious laughter between the two as a kind of thing which would stick it would just like remain in the memory was so strong because it just you can just feel how she felt
that moment and this particular detail would stay with you wouldn't be so hard to shake and so sticky in your brain it was that was the most powerful moment of the day from and are lined up with one of effort and are mira bad at at an hour when he right hundred and gardening and fat black at
when quite odd the and he to make
her being you know
that advocated there's only one of them was a motive for line really
unless you think that done and has a long as a long game where she's just been waiting to bring him down and this is a moment to play which i think is preposterous only only he has a motive to lie them she does not really she's not making any money it's not going to it's ruined her life it's annihilated her life so that's one big issue
thing that i thought was so telling that the afternoon is that actually the republicans did not at all engage with dr boise forwards testimony they it was as though she hadn't even been there they didn't press him on anything that she mention they just allowed him the conversation in the afternoon
republicans perspective was just cavanaugh his honor protecting has on our heat he was speaking up righteously for himself and he'd been characters fascinated by a democratic clot there was no sort of substantive engagement with the actual allegations that she made and her incredibly persuasive testimony to that effect
at that
a event
wrong but body if you're a traitor testimony
enjoy reading up
agent air
a male republican edit or delete air
doubting whether it ever happened women in general
what any operated eric are allowed been
i've found a credible
the nature of the quiet
eric
admission
it drag
i think it may engage with got war much a writ running into a lack of a better grade and immediate problem
and aren't accurate
having an hour
that ain't no harm
i mean my critical thinking when you add me on our are biodegradable economic yet
i have not yet
and i and
and not yet know i mean and and
and why the lack of a coping argument really hurt
the night or of logic
everything we heard from boat by and i together will be unified field theory
now that it can be understood with the narrative arc
act that were
that i at this point assume that he's going to be confirmed i think it's very likely there will be a party line vote on friday morning where they will vote for him
out of committee and will go to the floor and i think not
be enough to stop collins and murkowski from voting for him i just don't think they can withstand the pressure that can come from the base after kevin has exceptionally forceful performance and the pressure that will come from trump on this if that is the case and emily you can disagree about whether you think that's going to happen
and for the game that arrogant
it gave up and cardigan workout he buried it right
rail on women that will be a good at i mean maybe they aren't
tomato it but i don't know what it could happen be act right and i can
yet about really likely
if that happens do you guys think that will be in electoral catastrophe for republicans do you think this is a thing which will cause democrats to come out and and be just absolutely outraged and turn out even more than they would or do you think as i think it's possible that this whole episode is going to really motive
ate a lot of republicans to come out and vote who were maybe weren't even planning to regardless of whether he gets confirmed i think if even if he gets confirmed they will come in or maybe it won't matter at all
i think
i think that democratic when women in general
divert from a broken to hear that line you been away
iran preparation not been heard and and and areas up their own
or very close to it
i think that it it framed on formation
republican not with women
and it becomes a motivational
motivation in
leave that out
people are animated by agreement republic will have gotten what they want it
confirmation of avenue
or that won't be a reason to turn out to eat around you didn't want it happened will be a big angry and walk around emily what do you think will happen with the court if cavanaugh as on a john roberts to so concerned with the courts legitimacy
and this
the notion that cavanaugh would be joining the court having pass through on the narrowest of margins in the most contentious of ways the so much question about his own credibility his truthfulness and the possibility he isn't actually a sex criminal what will the court be lake
i won't go guard at me that camera your me about incredibly emotional create and eight that world bank had on a rack grow back
mark iran agriculture am quite happy i mean
what happened in the crash helmet when you're in your came he from our you know
whatever it
aren't there
there will be
go more from critic government of weighing up require a make any five are willing partner or abroad and bombing
relate to women and they won't do it anyway because they will happen our could do it back or happen i can't believe over
hang in any way
out back haven't i heard that them
cloud hanging over him a background
john you're really good on history and on perspective do you feel like this cabin on episode regardless of how it turns out is going to the poison in the soil of american politics for generations to come or do you think it will be forgotten in the way that
these things
one seemed douglas ginsburg one seem important for this one seemed important and now no one cares wow you know a it
with you i think it merits berlin
create a girl and bird or create a liberal i'd i know
long term programmatic
in the legal community of i'm in
going back to the war court
i mean if you believe a republican cared more about it being ordered the voting issue and democrat
and her and that into a dramatic role
for trying to reverse the leopard
rude or that happened gotten the i think that i think anything
and more already happening but that happen on the lab and i think
gender
aspect and it and candor not yet like when a huge the conversation by ad here including now my way out
in our own experience in
an adult
you cannot get any any order and or and one
identity enrage than bit
and whether you articulate it or or i'm close to it
about a strong feeling you get a get you
go i think you will out an during in fact i hope it hasn't during impact in a different way
certainly left liberals been interested in the courts will be fine but i really hope this keeps people fired up about electoral politics like we can't rely on the supreme court to be the one arm of government that does our bidding
whether we're liberal or conservative you need a vibrant electoral democracy you need legislatures acting and i really hope that at the state level at the local level to city level and at the federal level that people are as indeed to ban that issue and as and use those institutions to move forward because i think those are the institute
that were designed to respond to the peculiar will the courts are very going to be very hard to move it's acting in by voting and by being incredibly active citizens and pushing for for legislation that you want that's going to make the biggest difference
the court is has become by because the other two institutions of government the other two arms of government have withered so and or so so bad and how they carry out their business it is declared has become overly powerful and so having democrats and quickly recognized electoral politics matter and vote and vote and vote and vote
that seems to me i hope is an outcome of this although i think what you're doing it makes great
it ain't your presidential election we camp where people at all current reservation about him but well name the neck or yeah
now that that is more important than any other optimal issue current and
we a job where you her certain odors but i think your your point
braddock and good adding a rope but with all of it on it
art that respond with different eat a different way that from an adequate know why we mean by and
narrative
it
embarking on and crime our current her right up by
on a you know from a lot on my current britain or day and a lot of to break
three and a way that it's not like he wanted at all
and it will be for naught i mean it that it's not her fault it is not her same the country but i am going to find that really really
but it's not for naught millennium
she did her duty as a citizen she did her duty with somebody who's a who's victim and she will be she may not have wanted it but it was you know sometimes responsibility falls on you and you have to act and she acted in the honorable right way and she will be i think rightly praise certainly on the left for
the next generation for having done that and while that may not be the same satisfaction is having actually stopped cavanaugh from becoming and justice a not stop from becoming a justice
it does not in any way negate or or or diminish what she did cheat and in order to diminish the impact that this may have on people and the same way that anita hill failed to stop the clarence thomas for been confirmed as the supreme court justice but changed america and i think that it's possible that ford will change american ways that we can't measure yeah
not in the way that she hoped to change it
but in some other way that it's hard for us to know but she moved to people she was credible she was it important and she spoke truth to power and that's all you can ask someone to do add up here rate and i need to get a rabbit and he get not regret having over at am i hope be
before at wow
not wanna out variety wanna be
he wanted to be it to do right
yeah to wait an hour
aim at are horrible
what
going to beat you
really hard
and made him over identify with her but i like yelp

i wish i could go get a beer on when i interviewed may regret
but
integrate york about her predicament were trying to get you a out of you manage that
but
it's cried
what with all the little
mentally indeed a bell our wonder
and created your way that made him now
neither nor nor lie down
all
mine came up with that what i felt like it wouldn't hurt at air date you know what she's going through
not move in any way comparable it
i'm like a lot of our political
yeah that they were white
uncomfortable
we're all we are operating in where we do
are you
anyway
really
emily what is your chatter i did exactly one right me
out you read a profile that i'm happy grab her
in new york without the actor bradley cooper it government not really while
a really wonderful damp what did you when you're trying to get knocked about her work
it will operate and you have to go right now anyway happy and generally an your profile rating
it went my late moment
quite dark day
good i've been trying to decide whether i'm going to read it and now i will definitely i read it
my chatter is another gloomy chatter so open the government and the project on government oversight for you
some materials from the department of homeland security and discovered and released this week
the i guess not that astonishing fact that despite the fact that homeland security secretary nielsen deny there was a policy on family separation she actively said there was no such policies they they fired and received for the memo that nielsen had signed which laid out the policy and family separation that policy that was so dreadful and
cruel and so vicious but the government was pursuing in the spring and
it is depressing that they would
lie so blatantly the secretary would lie so blatantly about this we knew this memo existed there has been protein and watching posted the memo existed but the actual evidence it is
depressing it's gloomy it is just further sign of the degradation the world we live in and the willingness of our public officials to manipulate the truth and to deceive us when his expedient for them so
good for them for finding it bad for us for having a government that was willing to carry out the policy and and mislead us about it
there's also a great listener chatter so listeners you've been continuing to send us great shatters and actually keep sending them we have another we have a live show this weekend and austin and will need a listener chatter for that and then want to
for the show color blair with and he was at at blair sided who sent to me and john and particular wonderful story from the new york times about how the abraham lincoln presidential library museum is a terrible state because they seem
in debt because they spent a lot of money to buy a whole lot of lincoln memorabilia
and one of the things they bought was a lincoln stove pipette which they spent six million dollars can imagine that six million dollars for a lincoln had one of three supposed lincoln had that existed and they have covered up the fact that
the f b i and other other indicators think this is not a genuine lincoln had that there's a lot of evidence suggesting that the provenance of it is not what it was supposed to be and they're certainly isn't a good chain of custody sending it from lincoln to to this museum and so they're sitting on this this thing which the
consider to be hugely valuable that actually may just be fraud so it was a great story in new york times thanks
blair cited for pointing it out to us
that is a show for today the office is produced by and frank
then you know what helped on production today's well researchers printed dunlap you should follow us on twitter that slate damn fast and to chatter to us there for as long and john dickerson i'm data plots thanks for less name we will talk to you on saturday we have a show in less than thirty six hours and asked austin so you'll get an extra bonus deficits
