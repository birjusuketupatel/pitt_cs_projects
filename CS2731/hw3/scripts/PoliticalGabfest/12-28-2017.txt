the show to rate
a huge thank you to they might be giants who are not only the most delightful musicians i know but they're also very philosophically difficult and i would give you this conundrum
from there are two thousand and two album know which i was into a lot with my children
which goes like this clowns are from the circus barking comes from dogs eggs come from a chicken and log cabins come from logs
but where where do they make balloons
hello and welcome to deflate political gap for december twenty eighth two thousand and seventeen the conundrum addition we are live in front of a sold out crowd noise
and morally confounded new englanders wilbur theater and downtown boston
and i want to start by saying that for too long this beautiful city has been held hostage
to the mole the old wisdom of ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau and tonight we come to jackhammer their names off these marble walls
and carved new ones
basil on dickerson and plots
right that we come we knew philosophers to conjugate into mall
to consider into way to ponder into puzzle over the most important problems of our aid such questions as would you rather put clean clothes on your dirty body or dirty clothes on your clean body
and is it insulting to get someone the gift of a cleaning service
so now let me introduce the knights combatants first on my far left standing six feet one inches tall the reigning world champion of gentlemanly interrogation

and to mine year left standing five feet nine inches tall eight

the pride of new haven connecticut
emily bad

i'm and i'm david clots else obscurity
the no to their socrates

so let's start our conundrum share with one we already mentioned emily
would you rather put clean clothes and your dirty got a dirty clothes and your clean body which is the right thing to do okay so i tried this one out on some of my law students and a couple friend to speak and i not impassioned by different answers
wow
i feel like the natural answer is that you want your body to be clean and your close be dirty but here's the thing and i'm not actually sure you either of you are going to relate to that but if you're on a long back packing trip and your dirty in your ears okay you will relate that's but david kind of hate like nature so i was six
call so that like blog right for pinocchio not go ahead anyway so if you're on that packing chip in your your your your your a demon leave dirty and you've stopped worrying about being dirty it's like not thought of you at all anymore you can smell her every smell and that's that's the way it is it's actually really great
put on a clean pair of socks i really love that moment you dig that last clean pair of socks of your pack

i'm not going hiking with you
yeah i think that's right i think that's right but isn't aren't you know isn't that overstating the case like i mean that case any kind of relief from the fuming fetid cloud
of affluence is
is welcome
so what are we talking about here are we talking about mildly dirty or
well i think of it under any circumstances the clothes are absolutely filthy we love you can't even be clean for dirty clothes and then either although i guess you could take a dip in the stream
that's child left that part i'd rather be i'd take a dip in the stream and put on some like clean warm socks because frankly i did all this hiking i got all of sweaty and i got all the way up here to this incredible stream and unlikely to find the sox more appealing than that cool stream than i am i too i agree with that you should definitely
bathe rather than were clean clothes but i will say that when you come across people who smell the smell because of their clothes not because of their body or and if he had something to think about and if you feel clean and then you put all that smell right we're not talking about caked with my like who cares about kate with nine i would argue it's all
to do with odor and like sweat
but that's for other people's in this for you but don't you feel really self conscious when you think is now i do it like that unless you're not self conscious and somebody needs to write you a little note anonymously
say you're you're kind of dna
what's gone next one is an an audience question your phone somehow connects the internet and the cell towers of two thousand and twenty five you don't know how long you have to stay connected what do you call myself to see if i'm still alive
how do you think your number would be that you think the number would be the thing
well you how do you call yourself because you'd have your number you'd call and your phone well how would i get cell service and twenty twenty five i may give me some to working with iraq
that would be a terrible thing to find out why would you want to know them
well perhaps it would inspire me to do something to either a keep myself alive or be do something incredibly powerful with the remaining years i have like figure out how to go into the future and call myself a spooky
one can be really boring like i'd want to make sure that all the countries that currently exists still exist like our country in particular i want to know what do we still have united states of america that's so we haven't you go to wikipedia him look up united states
could figure that out by asking a more interesting question like who's president and what's the balance of power why they would oh my god you guys are to it is so have you go and check the stock now it's just like oh invest in at us and now you know and who won the left and super bowls you can lay bets on that yeah
you know as well
that's smart
are not a smart can you imagine if you're too fat two thousand and seven self had been able to do this you called and you did just what you said now
now i'm like what i came back from somewhere in believe it
yeah the money was an afghan pew dump
cop came back from being in captivity and did not believe the downtown
very recently yeah of was a joke thank you
okay here's one it's kind of time we would you rather work for a great boss who's a terrible person
or boss who's bad at his job but a great person
actually let's pull the audience let's do that there's always a fun thing that i
sales or with the first one the for don't do anything at first will do cheer for great bad boss bad person second which year for a bad boss great person so who would want a great boss who's a bad person
who would want a bad boss who's a great person
but
what if your definition of a great boss that there a good person
well that's obviously that you start arguing that what happen
how mad
well they're bad boss or bad person yeah i know that that person's like easier to a i mean they could be a bad person in many ways
had her son holy outside the context of work that they now i don't think that you have to imagine they're bad person i mean they're mean and they're not like they're hard to work for and women they're not
that you could be very strategically good at making judgment calls are lots of magazine editors who are not
i accept the head president company excepted
many many companies except but like someone who is very authoritarian and doesn't treat people on is undermining but has excellent judgment
you didn't speak and you're the boss
well i don't i think if you define bad defined bad person to say that are unpleasant person to be around the office than than i think i would
your definition i guess my i think the good case is this a person who is like outside of the office is a total humanitarian they're constantly going to the mid song sung frontier and they are raising foster children but in the office and then a lovely in the office but in the office is a mess companies
total wreck no one knows what they're doing to losing money or someone who's a an absolute beast outside of the office who who's on his seventh wife
cut off all of his children commit crimes but in the office is it is just like making sure everything is happening i think i would take that person yeah
it's a much harder question if you imagine that the bad behavior is in the office but it separated from the person's professional imagine that the boss and the offices actually can't really imagine that is a good boss
it's impossible but imagine a black guy and he had like a real it was making a lot of money and giving you a raise etc we don't definitely the lesson of the last few weeks has been the people who are bad people like are brilliant that
the and they're mad yeah no ne
solve on do you did you have a position that i
no i don't have a definitive position that would benefit from additional illumination and this question
would you rather stop aging at age thirty and lived for thirty more years or stop aging at the age of seventy and lived for seventy more years and presumably here's the question do you do you live at seven need for seventy murray will stop stop
embedded in the question you know
just singing think other ages where we do it because i think the right answers like forty like are just a few years ago
yeah i'm now forty seven and i already had my body is is not what it used to be but for it
so let's mean
well i guess at what point would you know this point would you know what will because of you knew you were gonna live for seventy years at age seventy then and eight age for you wouldn't let yourself go
let's have already so you would take your forty year old south for forty more years over your seventy year old self for seventy more years definitely you're really i don't think when as seventy i don't think i'd feel that way it's not because i feel like when i'm seventy all hate life it's that i actually feel that nobody that people shouldn't live to be one hundred forty i don't think that's i think that's a
against the natural order and that basically your time and ninety like that
what would you do in a lifeboat if he had to kill somebody question
well david sentence you are and and all that party
it's dinnertime
what if you didn't worry about that for a second like you gave yourself special dispensation then do you think
i think probably than seventy and seventy one if you use but none of us would take thirty and thirty it seems like i don't think so that doesn't seem like and also i haven't been thirty bucks so much better than the also i guess it depends what you're going to be like an eight seventy what if you use your phone call in the future to figure out how you're going to be seventy to say if you're going to be er at seventy and then you can make the
you're not old enough that twenty twenty five will do that for yeah but for the purposes of the joke it was ok
seventy over would you pick seventy over fifty yeah i want i want agora with you pick your ninety ninety over seventy years
the for ninety more what do you think it's going to feel it
in movies and conversations you can have you get to see your great grandchildren read old guy they'd be dead your great grandchildren
very dead i live to ninety the chances that they are having them be regulated the bowl or any myth about this ever it never ends well and and about that you want to turn things to go oh no wait a minute
you're the one who wants to find out what the stock market's going to be like so you can make the money i mean and if it's a curse at age ninety it's a cards at age fourteen it's not like it gets more curse the longer you live
the rumble still going argument would work at age forty or nine and i guess you could always if you did ninety you could say well can if i don't like it i can always kill myself unless you're a you oblige she live to one of us who have to yeah
there's an actor
long i pick seventy over thirty forty fifty and ninety let's do this one suppose we live in a state in which it is a requirement for every citizen to run for elected office at least once in their adult life think of it and give it like election duty instead of jury duty you can pick any job any
elected office what level of government what position do you want to me
somebody desperately wants to be on the school person
sign up on it
home
this feels like not an obligation and would happily do it if i didn't i didn't hand written so many things that would disqualify me for every ever any
i would run i would happily be a governor or mayor i would love to do it either
good at being a legislator legislator i would but i really really want to be mayor over governor
i think i say in to be governor i think mayor never though if they're both really fun i think mayors have a little bit more power ugly like that
yeah they had organizers our constrained
let's city would you want to be mayor
i don't think so i don't live in boston so that would be weird i'd have to commute
that
no i think the mayor of new york is the greatest job in the world
incredibly fun as you get to know all those yankees games
what about you go
now i have two answers so i want to be on the parole board because that's really important
unsigned and i don't think there should be like a long line that's great that really and that's really my answer but also since i'm writing a book about prosecutors that's about elected prosecutors i would want to be elected prosecutor and they have a lot of power
i'd want to be a mayor but a i don't know what the size town but but manageable city where you could actually innovate and tries to out and not
like older or i a man
that barreling to burlington vermont
wasn't burning as and i get better than i could remember he made a man and then
then you and bernie areas
very similar profile
i've got one here what's the most useful maxim in your life
and or what maxims do you live on you have any
this is selma tomorrow john question you must have like ten answers to their
i could barely come up with eddie only have one maxim is my
max level they're defending life hack
which i have an infinite supply you have a maximum of maxims
well do unto others as you had them them do unto you that's a good one the worst thing about somebody isn't the truest thing about them
dickerson favorite that's a one that's a great on know always go to the funeral
that's good or other than life event in question is does always go to the funeral have a more gentle
version which is always go to the book party
yeah often similar
the day before in the theater how it
i like this is immoral war career one but if you can if if if lay flowers or finances allow do the thing you like not the thing you think you should do
that's good
i have to one requires is little story the one is never go somewhere you can't leave so i don't tend to get on boats for that reason
unless they're docked in listed on daughters of their dog
the other is actually my brother's here tonight and you probably remember this is there a nominee would probably have seen the movie street fighter
but the movie street fighter his role julia's final movie and he plays a character named gen bison and i probably a mis remembering this the street fighter peasants out there just lay off
and the final accommodating see the movie the heroine who is is accompanied by jean claude van damme the hero have finally tracked gen bison down in his lair and if confronted him in a heroin says to gen bison when i was seven years old you and your soldiers came
to my village you murdered my mother and my father and my brother and sister in front of me and burn down every building in that village and ever since that day every breath i've taken every step i have taken has been with the intent of seeking revenge on you have getting revenge against your general
bison and gen bison says to her
for you that was the most important day of your life for me it was tuesday
and that's kind of the way i feel like you have to remember like for the things that feel important you for other people often it's like for them it's tuesday
now go and
good
maybe a thing as i remember that
he'll busload
i were gonna do one more question and then they might be dancer going to come back for a little bit if you were down to your last fifty dollars to spend on something other than food or shelter what would you buy
in a team
you were like you said before you i've got an answer
like you and your jacket
that was the thing were so excited and i guess i did have added i just said that was the first answer the can't and i didn't reflect upon it
is it the proper answer either music or a book like that that was his in for your whole life the last fifty dollars you can spend before you say for the rest of your life now
he had about an imam but your food and shelter is taken care of
late nine and and says
dad and
i meant by that phone they couldn't called home germs in the cost more than good ives what would you buy what would you spend your own thing and how much do you write and how long is the fifty dollar let's say it's a week
well we but you have food and shelter rate your food and shelter and but nothing else utah i need something to read books yeah yeah i would think i might get a bike i'd get like if i could find a cheap bike
i would like that i really like rank i feel no yeah i mean it is a great i think you could you have you could buy food and shelter and close personal good i yeah well so the problem is you could borrow by just like you could borrow a book so you might be what if you are house pound
that your your bike problem by the time the time
once i think they can
yeah yeah so so the libraries are closed
yeah he can he logs to make a fire i guess that i'm out there etc
how that affects i was thinking about now that's a good idea
what about you know like pool it was it some are like a beach some other
be going to a national park right yeah just entry a ticket to some but they think the thing is when you buy something useful or just be like okay let's blow it on pleasure
i mean i think that i'm not gonna the reason i got a national power yeah you get bored the beach her week
i am the national park could be that yeah that's good may their ago
ladies and gentlemen they might be giants


but

which

how many days before a long planned and can you send an invitation without undermining the line you write that says we'd love to happier
right right so i got intimidation was like we really love to see you oh that's cool when is even it's a day
selling days not and say well i had my first reaction was wow a lot of people said no
then did you not want to go was at a party
like him or water was as it was something to which i couldn't attend because
i had to wash my socks romantics taking
when you're extending invitation than you do something last minute it's not with ellen it's not necessarily a plan b or c or even if it is it could be like whole heartedly will do you live him
yeah well
amazing that to go to it all
i mean i have often forgotten
somebody who's a dear friend or something you know and me like a buddy read them alone you say i can't believe this of all the people i want to do
then presumably because they are a friend they know that your absent minded and slow witted
and along and own laid planner and they forgive you
very few people actually in the world who owe you a decent it right
it's a good idea to keep one's feeling of being insulted to a minimum in general and now i have many that mac address
that's absolutely right
now
totally right and the corollary is also did not feel a sense of obligation by somebody who are you a false sense of we'd love to see you that's that's right all right we weren't going to put that on the maximum witnessed on the fridge i feel like it's good to be open until last many invitations ending them and taking them and as long as right
but but if it's ask you to do something professionally and it's super last minute then i mean this i think this well because sometimes not infrequently i am the only woman on a panel or whatever and so it's really clear oh yeah
you don't like seven me in the last minute you're sort of
by this is something that happens so when i get a last minute invitation for that i don't think all the woman dropped out and woman and i'm sure i'm correct about that actually go get a little spicy wanted to go depressed after dark here
so if you're being offered the option to extend your spouse's life by twenty years by having an affair with someone you're attracted to and your spouse will never find out about it
would you do it
can i can this isn't the aren't the incentives in this question messed up
it should be
if you is if it were to extend your spouse's life by twenty years would you let your spouse have an affair with somebody
men are more interesting is that isn't that more spicy
so how long as the affair is it like a really long and ball well
it is about turning years
what know what
you're going to this was kind like you never find out about it right so you don't know well as you can't grant sent to the bubbles
it's a two year affair
who got so long
like very emotionally of that one
at that point what are the remaining eighteen years going to be really lucky can
team years of recriminations
when you have or find our road
that's the key you never find out where you wanted to find a maybe it's better if you find out you're going to honey i'm extending your life by you going to having an affair with no harm
h r
well and then who gets to pick the is that of your spouse's choose your spouse's
it's it's
as obviously yes the yeah yeah yeah yeah you're doing it
if you allow yeah then
i guess he gets to him because slightly uglier thing about the original question is framed the original question do would you have an affair extend your spouse's life were having an affair
yeah i think you do yeah
i mean i don't know how the mechanism
i think you get in trouble which every answer you pick but this question because it's all benevolent you're only thinking of your spouse
anything i framed so
right
o k l a rake the yard
take out the garbage in all right i'll go and have an unfair to extend your life for twenty years but you know i mean not to cast a pall and this but of you said it was your child you'd say yes and a second right oh yeah corso
your where you're saying yes anyway so why does that make this much more acute version of the
say yes faster i'm saying it it when i went stress you like
why your spouse to die earlier image cases in that sort of so you can go have an affair what if it's a stranger what if it's a stranger but you know explicitly the you having an affair will extend that stranger's life twenty years
oh that's good
tell me more
live by the golden rule
yes right it's an act of charity
fair or do anything like how could you know that seems to attenuated mean your they were hungry and new fed them they were naked and new clothes them
they were naked
the same percent is brought to you by health care if travel nursing is lost its allure discover a better way and healthcare take advantage of their clinical latter designed for professional development work study program to advance your education and a personal career coach to god the way down to settle

oh yeah that's when okay would you rather have cat's whiskers that you cannot shave off archive or a lot and fairy tale
that is literally the easiest question i would like along for retail period
i could get a transplant today for a fairytale i would do it
just added itself as a ferrari yeah i've got the same way if i was going to know something i would be afraid that is for sir
what a beard has incipient version as course yeah no and of course you pick the tail because the tail is as more versatility as an accessory really but david have whiskers the cat's whiskers and
where were you would you take the whiskers no i totally would take the town i didn't realize there was so obvious though is there any that case
is there anyone not to make a pejorative is there anyone here in the audience to take whiskers
a minority interests
they're functional whiskers definitely was a it
i mean for sure
when you're going to stir your cocktail
no offense that since danger
he said
a bit of a danger is that close to your face kids you see it
should be like dogs years that's really useful years that work like a dog i think i would choose that may be over at hell even though they would be what animal what animal quality would you most want well besides flight which is obvious
i would want to curtail i would love a tail more sense of smell or hearing from like it never
there are a lot of really good mit scientists here tonight
just know that there's a mark
that hard tail and irish i would totally peck i think olympic sound but i'm really torn about this now except then you have to smell the bad thing where is it so his flight flight is often because if you have a lot to have is okay
i would want i would want the cheetah like reflexes i mean more than i already have
what about would you want to be of the rock climb a mountain goat or one because i know be a mountain goat
i guess you don't have to inhabit the lot of either
the talent i would want to move like amanda mean just actually i'd rather run faster than be able to climb
yes i've lost my climbing fuck am i feeling the climbing is more out of body experience
yeah
is it insulting to get someone the gift of a cleaning service
so let's hope way can be pulled this one because i feel like it is it insulting to get someone to give to the clean service first we're going to say it is insulting them will say it is not it is insulting to get someone to get to the cleaning service
it is not insulting to get some of it
i have a hand to the person and think you can give your parents or your parents and cleaning service gift that seems like a super aggressive and maybe not what about your daughter in law oh no pride actually also not that any fraud family relationship this is not that i don't when
your friend
yeah and are you get it added are you getting it just out of the blue or is it their birth think it's their brakes their birthday it's their birth and get and they have just returned from hiking
i just had a baby that some people need know that's different you they just had a baby that's fine no it's more like this is their daily you know their everyday life in the house next year dirty if it that they have like really mall the sponges that their think that i
the audio didn't capture emily's delightful expression and
so why do you think it's okay i actually think it's hugely insulting i would be hugely insulted if someone did that to me i feel like the that that is something which is very personal and to pass judgment on someone else is life and to say they should be improved it's like buying somebody who is overweight a gym membership yeah
yeah it's like that's not that's not what like want us there
what if it's just a nice way to take a load off your finances by getting you know him well okay yes there is a model of it which is like that there's a model which is yes
it's a person wants for themself it's a luxury the you know you go to their house and you see that they live like pigs and like they shouldn't live like pigs they what they really need is a clean service they don't bid maybe they don't want to clean service maybe they like living like like pigs why did your neighbor has a really messy line and you offer am i
i don't know usually people do this just by cutting the name of the landscaping service like in a car and in the mailbox listen if you know them and they're located in the a nudge them in the landscaping than they're going to get a leaf blower and then every saturday morning at eight a m
that am leaf blowers going to be going so let's ruin my family leave let them live wrapped in the vines of there was syria and
if it helped me listeria am problem who'd the period of your life that defines you is an interesting question again and to hear you that what period of your life to find you
for me it is that the period when i had my first job and journalism the city paper i was learning to journalists in my mid twenties i met on a rosen who would become my wife
i yeah that's right
not having an affair to prolong your life
that you know
the joke is whether a new didn't she is so
good point the
yeah that's when i learned i learned i learned professional habits i learned my profession i learned what it meant to be in love with somebody and to build a life together that's definitely a fascinating because my period is from the the same time not when you met your wife but from been
but from when i met my wife at college because it coincided with the period is junior senior year of be becoming intensely interested in a specific area of study which then turned out to be the thing that i would do for the rest of my professional career assuming i don't follow my dream
becoming a i don't know what my dream and see i'm so bereft of other options
so i wonder if if it's really the the meaning of your spouse that's so far in this experiment two of us have said that emily would you
there's a lot of pressure here
sorry i didn't mean to do that at all
my husband never listens to this
never now
let's see well no i think that all makes a lot of sense i guess so for me i got married when i was twenty five i think emphasize that feels young to me but then i didn't really tired then i tried to be a journalist from lousy newspaper and then i went to last
school and then i read
and then i was a journalist far from
publications i like better and so i would actually put it later my kids are born and i was twenty eight and thirty i think that so that is the most life transforming event that's ever happened to me for sure but i think i would say that it was like my early thirties when i had really little kids and i was
trying to figure out how to be the professional south i want to be because i think actually having young two young kids is the hardest time to a parent and for me it coincided with the psych important and then my husband had to really like support me and helped me there are so he's still crucial
arts or a new one more question than there may be it's so audience question

them into you know you doing
the nautilus machine is probably we do and him and sometimes out of the be demons going to be considered to and then soon
who knew to see and thinks he knows what the nothing she could see them
they've been over feel good he said essential and sweaty and met a group in a few comedians
amanda go when you can say only and see and say things both hell broke loose when we have come to reenter they've been through on your now let's go to the lightning around john marty marty who you are you going to do to some baroque genetic condition you have to give up either all food and beverage over room temperature
we're all food and beverage under room temperature
which you choose
marty the other snare over and drove her under
it's really hard
wait you're weight sorry to let's keep it what do you going to continue to consume so you can hold food or hot cold yeah you're going to keep the cold food or keep the hot food i eat much more called to not been but keep it really sad to imagine giving up hot
colin thing my escape and i think maybe i have to go over to hot even know i'd be giving up like eighty percent of my diet but happen
oh so your point is that the the hudson it even though you eat less frequently is that much more powerful yeah i never have hot breakfast or hot lunch but they're just from the laziness or choice
no no no no i mean i agree and like good hot breakfast can't be the which is or money or blue apron is one of our sponsor
make fantastic home cooked meals
and take pride in your own cooking
is anyone going to pick call on the
maybe should know blue a for wouldn't meals or call their own
i i'm a i'm a caffeine addict and i need in the morning so everything else and
what about when you're really hot sweaty and you need a cold drink but way
your dirty clothes
do actually this is a crucial question so and the hot coffee front what about you'd be getting a cold martini
and not and not just for the article
year and a cold gate area in areas
it's called bubble tea i would be bereft of bubble tea
although a maybe you could be used to a higher higher
can you get used to it after a while
right so who are going to what do you want to keep so if you want to keep cold will go first and hot go second who wants to keep cold
who wants to keep
stronger presence for cold than i would have expected but emily you made a very good case for ours
next you are wrongfully convicted for a crime you didn't commit you're up for parole do you admit to the crime he didn't commit and get parole and live free or continue to proclaim your innocence and stay in prison so i hear a lot of stories of people who do plead guilty or admit
helps but then the and even to get out and not then it's very hard to live their lives
that's really tough on the other hand if you imagine being in prison like for the rest of your life vaccines i guess worse i would definitely admit the crime committed and it as a member of the parole board how would that affect your view well actually the reason this is important and happens is that you usually can't get parole and that's you
net response really or crime and so if you maintain your innocence you can't get out but when you i think it depends what the crimes
it has to be a bad crime should we are in for a lot like it depends them how bad jail is
well i guess that would depend yeah because i ever got like you can't leave
oh no budget say state
hard time
well i could be really i just feel you just pick a side pick a on with that i mean i will admit guilt but i might bleak and worst case
yeah like yeah i did it
marty
username marty marty marty
going to stay and man and connection and more in the lead the the general has the strength
dig his way out
six
john did you did you say
you stay in prison for wives or for the remainder of your turret doesn't say then add to that so imagine it was murder and it's the difference between getting out now versus twenty more years
it's murder you don't come to you took some
internet minutes
it's just that one of my maxims
have enough of that you're not going to kill anyone in the first yeah it's devlin mags and don't kill anyone although you can have exceptions
but not present company which fictional character would you most want to be friends with if they were plopped into your life here and twenty seventeen lyra from his dark materials
always there
that lizzie bennett from pride and prejudice should be super fun to hang out with and then really yeah no yeah she'd be so fun to chat with be a great friend and then i think that the clark gable from it happened one night
and i would pick that now that it's arguably mum no know the clark gable character affirmative name is whatever the character hand his journal of these this is opened up the whole new realm of possibility it then you could go to like catherine oh really
he's a kidney a fictional character
she so annoying and i like that character
have fun margot channing room temperature region
i thought of films cash gandalf
i marnie
a minute
a great time on this one so i really i have to remember no ads name but the main character and middle march i really love our maybe dorothy my name and then and this would be complicated and a little dark but the main character and house of mirth his name is not merely by yes
presumably when she's alive yeah and in hopes of keeping her
he needed a friend ray know
read fred taylor feel they would really be out at writing on your in atlanta i think i could somehow what two books
define you are most important to you
do most important to find new maybe define you
emily
while the book that i read over and over again that like the most relevant as a journalist in the murder
but the books that i feel from my childhood that i think about a lot the to tasty ten bucks to the and those bucks prime nobody on the stage they're mostly read by girls but i think they were great and me a lot of ideas about family and friendship and what a good happy life is come from those books they're not books that are about it
tragedy or like or offends are ending
okay
mine are similar to yours i mean i would say farmer boy laura ingalls wilder
about the boy growing up on a farm in upstate new york as the eats a lot of pie and funny he any were any works really hard and only are they have the learning about the books which i and i thought of those two that's the one that made it's the most
boring and has a lease plot in it that after i like books were nothing really happened
i mean that you have this and all those books that are descriptive but that one in particular really has no arc
sometimes he buys just books full of blanket range and ox he trains his team of oxen yeah but anyway
the dynamic of the teacher friends to whip them he can't control them yeah
yeah the and the other one maybe is i think david copperfield because my father read it to me when i was eleven or something and just the memory of just sitting with him is just very important sense memory for me i'm totally took to find to me in a different thing i thought you meant like you are now i am a different
it was like that yeah
so the glory and the dream
new seeds and contemplation and bob dylan's lyrics are probably
just invasive answer
flat land an average
that and
the ice storm
tells my job
but not your adult life no longer my
it's an obvious when but catcher in the right
you know gave you a definition of and authority for sure important here
in and i don't know but define you but a book recent book called wonder which is
i wonder how
yeah
i cried and cried
i think the shock of the new which is just about modern our power to use the guy with the australia book and please and rereading please kill me
and it's having a profound effect what does what can please kill me it's an oral history of of the new york punk rock scene minus the people that wouldn't talk to them i'm very concerned that you're saying that defines you
we'll talk about it after the shogun
art last question the six of us are adrift in a life raft with no food starvation is looming how do we decide whether to eat someone
if the answer to number one is yes how do you decide whom
oh yes and it's it's definitely a john but
you are
i just say marty marty is an incredibly excellent physical shape
gonzales on drumming
but there is the healthiest the you're probably understated you already said that age forty is living too long so you'd pass you didn't understand it it's age eighty do you get to live forty more years
no no but you said at some point that was so what's your what's the age that you think he is determined that my life had already forty to eighty four to eighty
and while i eat subway
i'm totally i'm very i'm pro cannibalism i'm would eat and i would be i'm sorry you wouldn't get on the boat in the first place

quite to eating
bad idea to you either
just how are we going to decide that's an interesting question how much longer it's a good group because we have two groups of three year because we were on it we were on a boat tour together and like oh no we split is there a way to consume portions of each body in a way that didn't kill the host but the prolonged everyone's life
is there a doctor in the house
you couldn't get enough you could me right now and you wound and how would you treat that well that some need you need one hell of a first then we're going to vote all of us are going to vote
feed david would he really yeah he met with one of them
that's kinda great very guys boat how do we decide booty
already baylor well eat marty
whoever said they would no longer eat cold food would be a good person
i'm not even anyone i just like that i'm not getting involved in deciding and not eating any when it's you
the dead that girth down to be alive and eaten alive
he dead
guess no no no no no fresh and i resign be totally fine
one hundred percent
