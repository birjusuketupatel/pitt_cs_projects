hey
arizona republican jeff flight took to the floor of the senate on tuesday and delivered a sculpture of a speech without mentioning president trumped by name which honestly is quite hard to do it is very hard not to say trumps name for ten minutes i found flake assailed the president and his funky he said ray
reckless outrageous and and dignified behaviors become excuse and countenance just telling it like it is when it was actually just reckless reckless outrageous and undignified
we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is are right around the corner returned to stability instability right behind it we know better than that by now we all know better than that then this brave david this profile and political courage took his slingshot and his five stones and ran for the hell's he announced he would
not seek reelection in two thousand and eighteen he joins bob quarter the tennessee republican retiring tender from tennessee and george w bush the former president john mccain the arizona senator republican senator presumed to be serving his last term and five years from an election even if he has not serving his last term among the
few republicans who will call out the president almost by name
so emily is what flake and quarter and george w bush and john mccain is what they have done is that courageous is it cowardly somewhere in between
somewhere in between the right it's taking on the president of their party i don't understand the not naming i mean i guess for george w there's some to on the bad a former president that it was so clear that flake was talking about president champ that just seems like that's odd
in the speech deadliest me look i mean i think given where the beef is given flakes own polling which showed that his whole stance against chomp has cost him enormously there is some cost to being the person who stands up at least an immediate term and i think he made it pretty clear that he was making a play for
our history and he was talking about what are we going to tell our kids that we did at this moment on which is pretty profound that's a different lens and politicians normally use to make their decisions about what to say i think i'm the other hand i don't think we should be giving too much credit because speaking against champ is different
from taking actions that actually derail or unsettling his agenda

john
will see and and called the speech one of the most important sentence speeches of modern times which seems premature but
do you do you think it was important do you think this is a significant moment lead depends when you put the needle down on modern times that would be an interesting i know right
if you are going all the way back to the enlightenment
it right
and barely between the enlightenment and and and like eighteenth century that they really weren't that bad a really one and it will send it
they just sat there mute
waiting for the cameras to turn on can i
can i ignore the question
and address this question which is if you were doing the twelfth grade english paper about and analyzing flake speech he started it by saying
mr president i rise today to say enough so the fun of this is okay so the reason and senate custom you don't say the names of your colleagues that's why it's always the gentleman from this the gentle lady from there so when you rise to speak to the president you're actually speaking to the president of the senate but of course in this case it has a double meaning because he could say i wrote mr president
you could imagine he's talking to the actual president since that's the thrust of his remarks but the present in the senate is actually the vice president my pants who is a lifelong and dear friend of jeff flight they both came up through the same kind of tradition the same kind of conservative ideological position and pence through the campaign
constantly trying to convince flake to support that tramp who who did not support any and he said when i interviewed flaky said you know my pants kept saying that the president in private is a different person than the person you see and flake said well that's fine but i don't know how you govern in private
so just in that first sentence he kind of the the entire speech is contained in that first sentence and it's really what struck me about it was that it was a charge to his colleagues to not be complicit in what he says he is allowing this to go forward jeff lake is not exactly a rhino you know he comes out of that western republican tradition which is that the huh
of the new republican party knew i should say after eyes an hour or in modern times here so but you know it's the party of goldwater then of reagan of of nixon all from california all from the west he is not like some ish so this is an ideological argument quarter burger the german the center for relations committee who also not a square
well isn't is not a squishy i mean these guys both vote with the president like ninety five some on percent of the time which we can get to later but coworkers coming at it from a different side not from he basically said that the president is is in danger of getting us into a war by mistake so he's came from this kind of dire
security side so i'm trying to figure out how to characterize what the schism it's about because it's not really about policy i mean quarter and flake have particular policy differences with trump but really it's not that it's tempting to characterize it as a difference of style i don't think that quite does justice to it because they're also
these kind of fundamental democratic values at play about free speech and you know norms and structure of government so is there what how do we talk about it's a really good question because if you believe in what corcoran sleek and the number tempers the conservative movement believe in you are at a disadvantage if your critique is seen as just
theater review in other words he's a little too boring hurt for our kind you know he's not one of us
seemingly and unseemly miss which is and easily punk trouble debating point because it's like you know we could use a little more kind of spirit in our in our country and in our leaders but so the critique it seems to me from the two different positions are from flake it's that he is laws that he is not a conservative and so that ideologically he's not of our movement and therefore doesn't believe in the things
we believe in about limited government about morality restrain freedom like he doesn't believe in any of those things so why are you putting all of our chips on this president i think secondarily he has a moral claim that he makes about the president both the way he behaves in public and also the diminution of the party and the republic that comes from not standing up and saying as they often did
during bill clinton's presidency
is wrong behavior in quarters case it's that he is not up to the job and then he is in danger that he's undermining his secretary of state which is going to get the country in a position where it might stumble into war and or in a position where he is surprised by something on the foreign policy front news air or anything else that his instincts are not up to the top
ask of the job and so his is a much more kind of in the situation room when it's hitting the fan incapable of raising the level where he can make the kinds of decisions that you need to make to keep america safe for do whatever you need to do so those are two the critiques and then of course there are others to emily one of the thing
that flake literally said in his speech which i found bizarre was that he he's essentially admonishes colleagues not to be not to quail before primary challenge not to not to be daunted by that and yet as he out
as he himself goes off stage and so how how can a quarter in quarter and it is perfectly legitimate for someone to give up on politics and to give up on a profession to say i'm not going to run anymore it's fine to do that
all kinds of reasons why one wouldn't want to be a senator wen one wanna be in washington right now
but how can politicians who differ with trump up for these reasons the john just identified there and are in the republican party how can they run what can they do if if these two men who are the so far the most vocal won't stand up and fight and actually do something
what can anyone else do write they're essentially saying that the battle electoral he is last i mean i think you can argue that for the two than they can still be effective laces and maybe an offense if they're not being kind of mocked by steve baton for how poorly and are doing and twenty eighteen race they could get for like
they could be more effective that there's a way in which that they can now on rise above politics and in a particular campaign but they're absolutely not providing a model for anyone to join them who is actually running and array so who would that be a well i mean susan collins decided to stay in the senate and
she is on that would be on the target list in terms of being a republican she's actually far more moderate than a nice too
and so she's decided to stay now and she's obviously not have been this vocal sas has been super vocal will see whether he runs a nap and twenty nineteen and young at that's now
i mean there is a an alternate view of this which is not focused on the to who have dissented but on the and any many many many who have not the fifty who have not joined bad and so the argument turned in another direction is the president's winning he's pushing out these people who who
he doesn't you know who don't like emma say mean things about him great he's gone people be elected who will have to be get elected by supporting the president can be able to get their voters to turn out without that it's to change the votes because these guys normally vote with the president but it's never the less going to have you know it's moving things in the trump direction on its books every one other you are assuming that there are public and they're going to hold the
especially in arizona has no foregone conclusion chain and then i'll be interested that i'll be a fascinating thing to watch now
you could argue that if you want a republican to win in that seat you want to know who you get there is a chance that somebody comes in who is more like somebody mcconnell might like and who would win and there's also a big chance that somebody comes in who's more like the ban and and who's the van and gets as a condition for giving him sport money love and other
he was they will vote against mcconnell as majority leader which will be is one of the things to watch and in twenty eighteen one of the things that i find sort of sad about this whole spectacle is how easily flake and quarter and other people who oppose trump have folded
on this and that to me it's not a surprise that the defections that racine are coming in the senate because the senate is a place where essentially your job is to be a writer british and you don't actually ever do anything you're not responsible for anything
don't govern you just sort of you you high mindedly speeches the vote on class action lawsuits may is slightly again that it was a town
i know but it it matters yeah
it doesn't matter just as most of what they do is give speeches and then occasionally you cast a vote not and rarely these days i mean the article one has not been carried forth with the intensity there anything in there is expected husband one more moment on that they just dismantle the years of work by that consumer financial protection bureau that with going to the right to feel
it was a town of okay but i think it's just they've run at the centers of run up against someone who is it better read a recession than they are and president trump and they've just given up rather than say let's try to take him on let's let's challenge him at this it depends what your audiences because i think
there and this is what we were just talking about which is in terms of the republican off non presidential year electorate he's a better writer addition than they are in terms of the general election on audience or the country is a whole their rhetoric is probably more powerful with that larger group and then the president's yeah i think i believe but yeah
they're not but they will be in the in that year and two thousand and twenty they're going to be lobbyist working with her
pharma well and learning john k six campaign right there's a chance at some of the law primary job but on cases i think has been an admirable figure in the john casey has been consistent about this has stood up about this and has basically been doing this for a year when nobody else was so i'd give him props
so here's another thing that's going to happen is there's going to be a vote on this tax cut bill so what if like quarter doing with that
right so flake because i think fat nothing and opposition quarter has talked about not wanting to add the deficit so he could use that as reason to vote against bet i bet he will vote for and that the reason will be both his conservative politics and beliefs and also the fact that to vote against would be to vote against all his friends right it's not
just trump sick and agenda it's also mcconnell for the leadership that they're buying something harker as close to those people right i think that's yeah i think that's possible
it depends how many more rounds this thing goes i mean because it you can imagine it getting to a level where ones person whether you get into the middle of a fight and you just do stuff that the fight for for other reasons i don't know do you guys read there's an interesting story i think it was in the atlantic
it's always true
but it was the think
think the atlantic sort of surveyed a bunch of historians about whether they thought the civil war was how likely they caught a civil war was the united states in the next ten to twenty years and what was astonishing was that the there were some folks who thought it was like eighty percent likelihood and some of the thought of as as low as five percent but the consensus was sort of thirty five percent
which is a terrifying number but one of the one of the points that that the civil war historians were making was that sort of a instantly they don't think it would be something like where it's shiloh and gettysburg they sort of a different kind of civil war but we're going to bracket that
rounded up with
low low intensity gorilla conflicts low conflicts not not fall two sets of our charlottesville times it and got times right exactly sure i follow every week
and but one of the points to the civil war stories made is that they thought of a necessary precursor to a civil war was actually that the parties have to fracture they're one of the reasons why this happened is that the party system in pre civil war america fell apart and the wigs vanish the republican party emerged democratic party split split
and and so the question is is that likely to happen and the party i assume that's more likely to fracture would be the republican party
john do you think there's any possibility that this what's going on with the flake and a quarter and mccain and bush and romney presages an actual split i don't think so because you see romney mentioned in their romney's been pretty silent there are people even at
the who is in the usual suspects category he's now been golfing with the president twice you have you don't have critical mass and that was talking to a republican is definitely in the never trump camp and trying to figure out what to do with his energy and his argument today was the problem is that you have you have individually you have moments where you have flake and quarter and sometimes season
islands mccain and graham but they're one offs and so what happens is the president can just go as he explained to maria barter romo being the main and then he takes them on individually
they don't get gain the strength in numbers now one really interesting notion would be if the if those numbers let's just take the three you are and up for reelection and then susan collins who seems to be protected from this even though she's running again they could they could hold the senate hostage i mean if you want to pass them and your if you want a majority on tax cuts then come talk to us
for because without us you can't pass it and then you could add you can imagine adding but old ask questions with the president that's the problem as well as well as starting out on health get a definite it on and on taxes on we don't even know i mean right now there is a tax framework which they've now stripped like several things out of and the press
and has suddenly said like i don't want this and so it's not even clear what the tax cut packages anymore and even if you even if it wasn't about getting policy past it would be a way to say wait a minute you want these things to pass then you have to listen to us and you know and to use that as some way to change because one of the things that that i think you're touching on is okay there are complete
since their complaints everywhere but like what are going to do about it how are you going to leverage this moment to improve the lives of the people you were sent here to to represent and on you know that's not happening last point on this emily do you think in a year that jeff reuters a more about her more important figures and american political life or less important than america
the laugh let all yeah i mean i know i think that a well man or less as they see as as what what matters is who is taking over and in our state they're going to have a laugh and laugh at and microphone and know the question really will be as we've been talking about are other people then followed that and what else
happens if they turn out to seem really present but isn't it really just about trumps numbers but the base i mean how can you really get away from the deciding factor can i just on one point which is that there is the substance of what they're actually saying and whether anybody has to rise to refute it and say
i know this is not the case or in the people whether it's president bush john mccain and even john kelly last week talking about the collapse of standards in the country
it's a lot of people are don't on the collapse of standards various people are saying here's who's wrong and his not but what we used to agree on is that if standards of collapse one of the people we might turn to is the president because f d r said officer the presidency is primarily an office of moral leadership so the question then is is this
even if you even if you hold the president let's hold everyone blameless for the dropping of standards who then do we bring on stage to reassert the moral character of the country and if you can't make the case at the president should be onstage
isn't that curious because in most of american history you would he would be the first person you would bring on the stage
i think the first person to bring on stage
that anybody can different

when asked to a hardly need no introduction to your home audience but because we also have left turns out there in the world can packs of the state's attorney fuck a county which means she is the chief prosecutor for the city of chicago and environs chief band twelve years in the office handling cases
what insiders call line prosecutor she left the office and came back and cans action in november two thousand and sixteen to me was part of one of the most interesting and i think important phenomena in american politics today which is that a group of candidates ran for district attorney and state's attorney around
the country in big cities and small cities as self declared reformers and progress and to have a kind of different vision of criminal justice that is not merely about throwing more and more people and press and and it's a more holistic approach to trying to reduce crime and making their community safer and at the same time
i'm really paying attention to fairness in the criminal justice system so it's something i'm watching avidly and fuck am i going to ask first question so you came into office after the killing of the clan mcdonald on and a big fight in chicago for the release of the videotape of that
shooting both your predecessor and mayor a man you all really did not want that video to get out so it seemed and then it dead and so you came into office at a moment right think building and rebuilding trust between lawn poorest man made in your office and also the police department you don't want for see is
it's crucial factor for the culture and health of the city of chicago so how do you what are your first step the big job to take on how do you sort of start thinking about that why either give do first acknowledge that that has to happen and i think you have to say that we have to rebuild
preston and saying you have to rebuild means you have to acknowledge that it's broken and i think third too many people in our systems who don't want to acknowledge that perhaps we had been doing things poorly or wrong or backwards because then you are somehow complicit in breaking it means that you'll continue to do policies
that are bad because you won't acknowledge that it's broken and so i think i was very honest with the people in cook county that our criminal justice system was broken i thought that it was only right to not just look at other law enforcement agencies say police but what is the role of the prosecutor and i think in two thousand and sixteen
there was a real conversation about prosecutors know nobody generally knows who prosecutors are i wished you guys can follow other is around and clapped like you did for me
i have been
does not happen
have you thought about giving them like instagram account i mean
the nature prosecutor yeah i mean because no one it's it's one of those offices that are largely unnoticed ninety five percent of elected prosecutors run unopposed and so yes ninety five percent of elect prosecutors run unopposed so i ran against a two term incumbent
it always i think to myself what happens if i hadn't jumped in even in the midst of everything that had thing
we may have stillman with our former prosecutor and going down a path not just with police accountability around the climate that amount but around mass incarceration around a bail system that punishes poor people around wrongful convictions around juvenile justice in the school to prison pipe
fine and so i think for me same are bail system is broken and having the credibility with the public who already knows it
matters and then it means that i can get by and to actively work to fix those things

every time i
other states attorney's across the country
thank you
so can i do think that probably the first question the are always asked and our local audience may already be bored with this end up going on board with it
but from an outside perspective the the first
thing that everyone is remarking about chicago is the remarkable rise and gun violence and murder over the past couple of years and you are obviously new to grappling with this problem
what for those of us who were outside of chicago why what's what's happened why it had happened and is there any reason to think it's going to reverse so i mean we are in the grips of would spend the last couple of years arise in violent crime in chicago what this audience knows is that we have an over privileged
guns on our streets we have more guns taken off the streets of chicago the new york and los angeles combined
we take more often those two large municipalities combined and so in the course of the last couple of years in the wake of what was happening post lukewarm mcdonald in criminologists and sociologists will all debate
the impact of that is it the police are not doing more aggressive police is it that the community has not been as engage is it just the proliferation of guns i think we don't know what the answer is and anyone who says that they definitively know what the answer is i think is being disingenuous what we do know is that having
access to that many guns no matter who we have children eleven twelve thirteen carrying guns that level of access to guns in the absence of other things that we know that they need quality education mental health drug addiction treatment
really affordable housing the constellation or things that are happening in the neighborhoods most impacted by violence if we only have a conversation just about guns and not about those things and think we're gonna solve the issue of violence we're gonna miss the boat
was really important as a way of framing the fed of question that city needs to address i would add one more thing i'm curious what you think that's matters but i was looking at a graph of chicago's rate of solving homicides and and that has gone down significantly
fewer orders are being solved and that was horrible way to people can make an argument but that also yeah i mean it's all in related i mean if we look at the chicago clearance rate for homicides the number is hovering somewhere this year about twenty three twenty four percent which is incredibly low
when you look at it and twenty three twenty four percent solver not solved
and the national average
sixty percent i think
for shootings is so not not killed someone but you've shot someone and we have on pace of four thousand people shot the clearance rate is five percent one
trump could walk down with the three trunk could walk down the street been literally get away
he's very good so even if it's not clear what's causing why i mean that is a huge factor in terms of how people think about crime reporting the please come as a witness to testify in a cave and which is why i think the legitimacy of our systems matter if you believe this
someone can shoot you are shoot at your neighbor and nothing will happen to them then your inclination maybe if something happens to take it up yourself
so good oh street justice and that doesn't make anybody safe and so i think again
kim ill afford to say to people that were doing everything that we can win we're not and homicide clearance rate the shooting clearance rate i think the chicago police department is actively working on those things and actively looking at innovations from other municipalities because they're not happy with the i mean i don't want anyone who
here to be resigned that this is it is our normal right now but that is acceptable and i think the shock that you all have expressed by that number should also mean a push for accountability and i think that's where we are right now is that there is a reckoning
with our law enforcement partners what we have been doing hasn't worked and we have to do something different is there a isn't a problem to identify where chain
causes these low rates and or is it you know where the problem is you just need to implement a fix i mean how complicated use the response
it's complicated only in that not one entity own sake raid so if you talk to people you know the easy answer is what people in the community don't trust the police and so they're not talking and then if you talk to others it's like well the police came out in they saw the guy lay it on the ground and air and i who shot you and he was like i'm not talking to you and like
while we don't know and then walk away like that's also not acceptable it's not acceptable didn't no one talks and so i think you can't own why into of why that disconnect is there what i do think you need to do is a deep dive i think you do need to look at the data i think for some communities they feel like the effort is being put in
and that kind of fatalistic view of you want us to perish and that's frightening that is frightening and use said
they're looking at other cities and other communities is there a model that has worked in this her listen new york's closure rate is somewhere around seventy percent and at dc is down a little better but one point with almost one hundred of them through was really interesting and homicides went down thank you and pretend to understand
it fits decline
so yes there are other models
and
are those other models replica bowl or they just like well they've got a whole chicago's unique i think we i think it's only fair to say that i think how we do the structures around what we have historically call gang violence in chicago is different than it is in l a different in new york and different in dc
given other sentence of up a i mean yeah i think what's happened in chicago is we don't have traditional gains like people have seen from television shows of you know the bloods and crips on one side or the other we have real fractional a nation of gangs and we have
crews have two three four people who are part of a larger said who are literally fighting for a corner and not a full territory and so trying to figure out who's doing what you're looking at social media looking at facebook looking at snap chat an instagram to figure out who's beefing with who it's really complicated and
again over proliferation of guns also makes it difficult and so how you attack how do you you're
no head the to go after there was no structured is not it's not like the sopranos you go after tony they give up everybody knows there's the smaller factions that make it a lot more you have to be more nimble you have to be more innovative you have to have more ground level intelligence in a way that i think and other jersey
addictions there is a more organized network i'm here in chicago the only thing worse and organized crime and stuff going on has grown guess i'll have to give people a reason not to participate and see my other avenues for raid and of like fighting for our suspect all the time
what a lot of it comes down to listen a lot of it is respect a lot of it is money a lot of it is survival a lot of it is a amount of these neighborhoods that are impacted their quality of life is so dramatically different than any of us could ever imagine
no we we talk about why do people carry guns and i think for a lot of people the notion is where you must be a bad guy if you are and license gun carrier for them it's survival and what happens when we have a mindset where it is better to be judged by twelve
been carried by six and that is a very real thing and i think it's hard for broader communities to understand i think there's a there's a judgment that comes but the reality is we had a horrible murder
i have a nine year old a few years ago here in chicago who was lured off of a swing into an alley and shot and killed allegedly for the sins of his father and one of the things i say when we talk about that case people are it's gut wrenching
and i say that nine euro i had a nine year old at the time
who's now live then we lived many miles away and cheese happened to catch it on the news and she couldn't sleep that night and why and she's like there was a boy who was killed and i said that's not us it's not shoes traumatized
the classmates to shanley who will sit with that empty chair
everyday and sat with a chair everyday for the rest of that fourth grade school year
our thinking i've lost a classmate i've lost a friend in the most horrific affections is someone going to do that to me
and then there's someone who says halo mean i got something for you which is a gun
when we can get more guns than mental health and trauma treatment
we got a problem and that's what's happening

laptop that are though it's favorite example of what he all
the department of justice has really changed what it was doing and how though it under the obama administration there was an investigation of civil rights violations by the police department big report the city may or may not be implementing some of those changes but the federal government is no longer that kind of presents and what champ
attorney general fashion of talk about it's tougher police thing at the answer in chicago and across the country is that rhetoric helpful or not for you
i don't know anyone in chicago who takes this seriously
i say that with all due respect i mean i think if you
all due respect
do do is the key part of that thread
yeah we lived through would happen on what the climate donald we we know and that was kind of that was one big public nationwide issue but we had issues of wrongful convictions in this county for a long time we had the cases of john birch
he was a police commander who ran basically what's called a terror squad
where when we abolish the death penalty in illinois a few years ago it was because there were years of these horrific abuse is so much so that we have a curriculum in chicago public schools teaching about that torture
the people in chicago recognize that there is an issue with wanting to make sure that we have a police department that is the most of professionalism and integrity and doesn't abuse its citizens i think that is been a recognized give any here and so the notion that and as you say for most
most people here
the notion that what we've seen and heard for the course of the last two years is make believe no one buys that i think we have a real opportunity here
the attorney general lisa madigan went to court
to fight to enforce federally by a federal judge for oversight of the consent decree or work out a consent decree which i think is amazing we are gonna do a plug for shit cairo where chicagoans we really don't wait for people to come save us
we were waiting for jeff sessions to come save us
it's abundantly clear he whoa this is a real opportunity for the city again in that level of accountability to say the city of chicago you can afford not to do this and we're not going to half ass our way through it we're not going to just do small change
his we have to fundamentally change how we do this and it's in the interest of public safety that this isn't about villa nice aim law enforcement i am a law enforcement official it's about elevating the work because our communities that are being the most harmed need us to be at our absolute best and the pub
should stand for no less
what's the proliferation of guns what's the what's the plan their how does that get that that is the vexing question because a wee gets sixty percent of the guns that are flooding the streets of chicago come from indiana
mike pence
but still people who don't know there's intimately as our audience does what does that mean exactly that they come from india so we didn't have gone we don't have done dealers in the city of chicago there was laws on the books they're prohibited gardens been sold in the city of chicago
and we have very few and our surrounding suburbs and so the guns they weren't just popping out of the sky it was literally an iron pipeline from indiana and you don't have police officer standing on the border sand let me check your your trunk so there has to be greater coordination i will say
that the
add an additional twenty eight you have agents here in the city of chicago
police superintendent and i have been working on trying to come up with a gun strategy to deal with trafficking we're going to have a new us attorney in short order who have heard nothing but good things about who is committed to climb trafficking and i think it has to be a local and federal response that it's not enough
we've been doing has not been enough to do they just did the federal peace does the do they get this i mean in terms of you f
and the us attorney
i think they said they would send in the feds
in two thousand and eighty f agents
so i do think that they get the guide and pieces huge i think the us attorney's office
now this year my i'm saying have done more gun cases than they have i'm in the last several years i think we you can't not get it at this point you can not not get it but also getting at it the universe of getting it has been out rape and the real question is does congress get it would congress have her path
kinds of laws that will close the loopholes and allow i mean if you're having people go across one by one and bring back gardens that's different from like seventy people i mean one person bringing all bunch of gone are the purchasing them through unlicensed gun dealers is that the way the purple and works
one more question before you head off to and gums or whatever
this is a totally different
subject which is your elected prosecutor elected prosecutor seem like an atrocious only slightly worse than what the judges but i've never had the chance to share a stage
what's the case for you know what did rather than appointed by you want me to defend and buy it because i know
listen i it is an awkward position to be you know when i was a line assistant
again there was no you're out there you're doing justice you are advocating on behalf of communities and victims and the like
having to go and declare party and raise money and shake hands i mean when people are running for mayor congress so i wanna road i want to offer is justice grade
a lot it is thought that guy
hey you find that sometimes people who like are willing to engage early not just as that one something else
is that something else the three calls to cargo just
with a gamble tv show
oh by the way they had carl weathers play in the state's attorney and
and it didn't last
and
i agree with you i think the notion of having politics in in the justice system isn't is an odd thing but i will also say however having the people be able to give a voice about what their justice
system looks like if the traditional role has been quite frankly people who have not had contact with the community who believe in law and order and punishment if you have people like a jeff sessions who is appointed not elected he is appointed
are you getting a better system of justice i think the politics is awkward and eighteen and how you have to go about doing it but i also don't think you necessarily get a better result i think you don't get someone like me from the public housing of chicago
who lived the wired it and watch the box said
say and having proximity to the issues in where it's not academic if i don't have a chance to run for the people of cook county believed in a better version of our justice system and that's what they chose

what small left inspiring fact it is i think forty six or forty seven states liked prosecutors the appointed prosecutors are in alaska in connecticut and new jersey and maybe one other state that i'm forgetting say around and state it's our nor and there is a way
way in which that accountability banking or pointing to you can be a good as well as troubling petra it can fox thank you so much

so the first a trickle now flood
this week has seen torrent of news about really ill behaving man
but that's true most weeks really put this particular week it turned out that bill or riley paid thirty two million dollars
hey to thirty two million dollar settlement in yet another sexual harassment case after which fox still offered him a new contract
this but this revolution appears to have scuttled riley's plans to go to work for sinclair broadcasting director genes tobacco was accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than two hundred women
amazon tv executive price lost his job and mid allegations of of this kind of misbehavior john bearish a new orleans restaurant her lost his job with the head of his own restaurant empire for it the weasel to you're a literary editor and long time public intellectual was dumped by the brookings institute and also by steve
his widow marine mourn powell jobs had been bankrolling his new magazine
the group of former colleagues if weasel tears complained of his sexual advances and lecherous and harassing behavior and more and more and more so if at all over it's all over for the men is it just can we finally put a pan and these battles fell shiny
then more people out there who are quaking more than they were last month and they'd get i do think the fire say what the heck hasn't changed
so it does seem like since the bill cosby revelations and maybe there's a way in which you could date it earlier than i'm not thinking of that when a group of women come forward in solidarity there's a way in which the numbers themselves are giving way to accusations even if we don't
have a ruling in a court of law that in either the form of a criminal conviction or a civil suit backs them up and that wasn't true before it wasn't true when a group of women accused bill clinton of various forms of harassment and abuse so that does seem to me like a real cultural shift on the other hand a group of women accuse donald trump
of these exact well some of the same forms of misconduct and he was elected president so i'm not sure how we can say that now impunity has been forever rectified she say
the things that you did on the way to becoming president was bring some of the accusers to the second debate yeah the summer bill clinton's accusers to the second attack has worked for i have my thing
well the extent that he got to literally
but that also it me the idea of hillary clinton taking on this issue are the more difficult and this was after the actions center though
billy bush to tip to yeah isn't but doesn't until after her everyone's do that's the thing that because cosby was as you rightly say is the sheer tonnage you just and sheer numbers but that was kind of director good him what's striking here is that all of this behavior
it was at one level or another hidden suddenly once i mean just like there was a huge shifts
when that didn't happen after cosmic ray i do wonder though about putting giving too much power in terms of example to a situation in which a lot of some some to a lot of the women who came forward a very famous actress and with oh you have that that sort of additional
no interest in their word right because turn mean that you mean that the regular mode old person who's got a boss who's doing this has no more power than before her everyone's to that's right and that i'm just not sure we can universe
although but just don't know all of the examples that i cited and most of the examples where to think of in public our media business has mean john bashes at a restaurant germany's a fundamentally er media figures and i don't know that we're seeing in the mid sized insurance company market is not
sure that is happening in the hospital sector or men being called to account for their grotesque behaviors and only in professions where people are celebrities were there is a megaphone that can be used against them were this is going to happen or do you think this can apply to i mean because i am sure that if their sexual harassment going on
and how everyone seems office and and john better his office there is also it's also going on at hospitals and insurance company
no no no just a few worked for if you were just like an anonymous person and he worked for our relatively anonymous employer company and that's what's happening to you and you weren't sure if it was happening to anyone else would you be any more likely to come forward and also a simulated so i'm thinking about this a lot in terms of leon result here so he is the figure
we're in our field and you know we know of han we know women who have experienced lake crappy treatment from in the one time i met him i thought he was total lack dress shark probably doesn't even remember that i wasn't working fran but it's like a memory i definitely have
discussion of why don't people come forward earlier and when everyone knows this about someone why does it continue in that moment there's so much shame and you blame yourself and you feel weird about it i can't even remember whether i went home and told my husband like the weird yucky thing that i experienced a dinner with the enemies
voltaire cause i was like twenty eight and it made me feel worried that i had done something to bring it on the environment it happened in made me feel like you know that there was something probably wrong with me or just that he had power and i didn't so that's a crucial point is maybe my original view which is
wow something's really changed
yeah jumps over the fact that if you're still at anonymous company and you're still or it
it's only obvious in retrospect right it's like once the momentum starts and gwinnett culture was on the front page of the new york times making these sober accusations we see that as heroic an honorable man we start pointing fingers at everyone all the man around all the other women around some of whom were part of this are enabled that and it seems so obvious
who is good and who was bad and who's up and who's down but her a break like it's not the least bit clear that it's going to play out that way
have these of these households now made it unsafe for consensual work close relationships
is it a removing to a place where were you can't you can no longer sleep with your boss basically
i mean that's something that's happened on college campuses much more of a sort of old model of like okay well maybe i'm not gonna ask that woman out on a day while she's in my class but as soon as it's over i will and mean i have friends who are married from situations like that in how your
the bomb as a few resort of his supervisor right way i guess that's true technically yeah right so it's not as if it's always terrible problem that that power imbalance then translates into a different kind of one hopes equal relationship but i think our concerns about relationships that begin from the power imbalance is
continues belief in it does seem like when you look at the one scenes with bush's and a word processor weasel to their really pathological there's just you know it's not just one person who they've had a bad consensual relationship with it's like doesn't scores that guy two hundred you know one hundred there's a story written about this this director james tobin
some fifty sources in it and then in over the next day the reporter was contacted by one hundred and ninety three other women who had been abused by this guy and so should we make policy to deal with these highly predatory people who are abusive to everybody and thus should have constrain
what may be more innocent but still slightly a key relationships
where do you draw the line and his own i mean yeah i don't know i mean i don't know is it
there's so many people boss mary secretary
barack obama marries his supervisor whatever it is and you think that's a good story that's a happy story there's nothing wrong with it and but if we are fundamentally going to constrain sexual relationships at the workplace those things will go away and maybe they should maybe they need to go away to prevent the
the wind students from running rampant think you could argue that right now we have legally speaking the worst of both worlds so we have a lot of talk about sexual harassment the workplace and most of us have been through some irritating training about sexual harassment and that makes them seem like a box that you check off and it was ever failed that train
they make and model detailed though
i mean all other things like it's theft a should you steal the computer and take it own be no
and yet it still excruciating right so we have these training is why do we have these trains because the supreme court basically said that a way that companies can insulate themselves from liability it's by taking steps to prevent to say that they are on it and this kind of training checks the box and then if you get a complaint you have to have a
process for that complaint you have to investigate it but you can take do that investigation and a cursory manner put the results in a file draw and never look at them again and again you check the box and these allegations are hard to prove they often come down to situations of the classic he said she said where you know sometimes there's corroborating
evidence and sometimes or isn't and so we have a lot of talk about this in the sense that it's unacceptable and a lot of bad jokes about it and not a lot of actual successful lawsuits and successful monterey you know between bad jokes about it i can imagine somewhere now and workplace somebody in the course of just a p
or otherwise ambiguous interaction with people have somebody saying oh don't you know don't call me leon weasel day or something and using that to create a different power dynamic
in the moment we're in right because then you're essentially like mocking the person who has made me feel right and then the i think we should talk about are these non disclosure agreements and the role they play because this is a way of buying silence and then people who had these experiences don't tell what happened in a way that warren's other people now maybe
we think it's ok for companies to contract for people silence but there is this social costs so here's a question about the non disclosure agreements presumably a company that has a non disclosure agreement has this public media reputation that they're trying to basically protect because that's why they're the goes are so you don't quit and then make fun of your boss or the company and so
in that position isn't even asking for a non disclosure agreement that has this kind of sexual harassment okay by as clause isn't that asking for that now in this new environment
like a no no you can't you can't ask for that because because you had you are this kind of company were talking about you're not the anonymous company i don't think it can be i don't think it will work as a taboo if it's just a social norm and taboo only work if it's a legal problem right so there are these questions about the harvey want about miramax like if they find a new
contract with harvey weinstein knowing that he had all these settlements with women and they basically agreed not to look into that to treat as a private manner same thing fox and riley how can you say that your complying with these laws where you're supposed to be protecting your employees from sexual harassment
just to go back to
kim fox
as much
i cannot just say if i worked as an anonymous person an anonymous company it would be these kind of the chairs would be sitting
don't you feel like they're like from cannot going on
no exactly your performance reviews going very well and monster and minimum
you guys didn't answer my question should you be allowed to sleep with your boss
i mean i think my wife would be unhappy
yeah i don't i don't believe in telling consenting adults that they cannot facts that seems like a bridge too far can i say something else
this this moment of
scoundrel man has made me so much appreciate the man in my life wife worked for and work to whack who have like never made me feel like any of this was a problem we haven't been that and i don't mean to make the so purely
gender and but since usually we're talking about predatory man and blaming ma'am there are a lot of like in heaven
a decent honorable men out there who promote women's careers and make us feel like you care about our whole person
so we've had a series of stories about basically sexual harassment sexual assault point of women by men misbehavior to from we have not seen
i don't think kind of similar parallel examples of grotesque racist behavior or anti religious prejudice generally anti religious behavior
is that because those cases don't exist or is it because those cases art do happen but people don't perceive them has been outrageous or is it because people are afraid to report it would you think there is there's the harvey weinstein equivalent who is just
treating his latino employees in this incredibly terrible way racist way and then but it's not been reported or or or not
i think there are employers out there who do those things it way and then i guess are they doing it in a way that is somehow more hidden and so then harder for people to address lately speaking or is it possible that the sheer volume of sexual harassment is baker i'm not sure
i don't know
i mean yes of course it's happening i'm just trying to think through the
it doesn't i think it's chosen looking for the example the alien when i know what is mel gibson which was not a not what you're describing but it is
a way which public sanction for that kind of behavior when it burst into the open was severe and now maybe somebody would argue maybe not because he's still going to the academy awards and all the rest of it and and so is there i guess is your question
could this is easily happen to accompany the way it happened to harvey weinstein were some where there's initiating event and somebody says oh yeah it's been that way for years and just as a cute and egregious yeah
doesn't seem like those either people aren't interested in that are the the just don't become public or maybe people this is not a form of terrible behavior that people engage in all the time i don't know that doesn't mean the dentist it's just a super clear that racial discrimination in the workplace or and hiring and promotion takes place where i may or may not be like as
right right had pets oh no it's more women who aren't happening on in me in this kind of yeah a cute acute were yeah i have been a homeland continental yeah

so let's go to a cocktail chatter when you're when you're down in your peroni john dickerson what are you going to be chattering about
i'm first
you
okay me like it so i have recently been spending some time thinking about calvin coolidge is all of you have
because it feels like to me that the the modern presidency is bound on the one in by president trump and on the other by counting college and here's why i think that so calvin coolidge sometimes would sleep fourteen out of twenty four hours a day
and he also indulged and frequent the president is up early and we know from his twitter account that he's up early coolidge said that as a national leader president should not called go ahead of the majestic army of human thought and aspiration blazing new and strange pants
the president has definitely blaze new pants
cool it said perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my administration has been minding my own business
no presidential candidates said coolidge was ever injured by not talking too much so this is so a great president and then we could look back a myth
also this tragedy in the middle of colleges presidency where his son dies and so a lot of people think that this is what that he anyway but as i was looking into colleges life i found this somewhat amusing thing first of all they were obsessed with his health because of course harding a died we think of the presidency being covered a lot now but bank man there's a
story in the new york times coolidge takes it recovers quickly combination of heat and cantaloupe causes a breed
causes a brief attack of indigestion now is the sub presents up so there's an entire story in the new york times on may twenty third president had suffered a slight attack of indigestion today in his office
so as i was
as i was learning about the president's cantaloupe indigestion manners i found that one of the ways that the president and work towards good health was was was this and this again from the new york times prison coolidge owns a hobby horse this hobby horse is a very remarkable creature it bears little resemblance to the hobby horse have no issues or mary
grounds mr cool just played thing is an electric device designed for exercise at the fireside or for one who is not disposed to go outdoors is horses installed in the president's dressing room
so equipped that the person in saddle can take light moderate or heavy exercise the president's mount is said to meet the demands of exercise of a man who was pressured for time
so it turns out that the president of finland elliptical machine three times a day and hey zeus can we put a put a picture up on the screen
three times a day the president was up on this thing why he did not ride actual horses according to the new york times because he suffers with a nasal infection which is this is my favorite third tier my about marketing
better this is i'm just reading from the new york times what can i say
the failing failing near times
feeding and he suffers with with the nasal infection which his friends declare becomes aggravated by a fluke here
that arise from the equine hide
now you might think that this does not provide the kind of exercise that you would need to face the challenges of the job even if you are as coolidge one said that nine out of ten problems brought to his office could be safely ignored
this this device behind me offers the following vibrating handles and quivering straps on the automatic shimmy makes the body of the user shake and a highly effective modern jazz style
it seemed extraordinary anyway
so and then now i'm moving towards my conclusion
and i'm glad that that line did not illicit of blows
the reason we all came to know this was not because it was talked about or snickered about in the white house canteen but because the president apparently got on his mount and suffered an injury it seems that recently mr coolidge was putting the horse threw some of his pieces and that in the midst of the excitement
he got mixed in his buttons
this is not this is not a euphemism
according to the new york times the result was that the animal became involved in gate and the rider was forced in haste to jump from the saddle
can you imagine during the cold war if the russians new this thing be like
forget cuba we're just going right in we're just going to move the missiles and to baltimore anyway the white house veterinarian was not consulted wrote the new york times
instead and you feel like the writer had like a martini next to the writers he was having so much
instead
the president sent for an electrician
where is that
we're fed object
that's the calvin coolidge and historical museum
not part of your have
no no no when they have right that's like an early pellet time
emily what is your chat or fell and i have been paying attention maybe some of you have been as wow up late have a seventeen year old girl whose name we don't know i'm she was bad can't came to this country cross the border from a country in central america where abortion is legal and when she was
nine weeks pregnant in custody asked to have an abortion and her case has been litigated for more than a month
the champ administration's efforts to block her abortion included going to current and arguing that even though she was a miner who was saying that she was endangering her home country that the choice to not have an abortion was once she'd brought on herself that she voluntarily removed herself from the country and other words when back on to a place that abortion
recall that she could have the proceed to herself that making on abortion accessible to her and got custody of the federal government was was not acceptable to the politics of the trump administration sell lots of litigation judges on both sides and wednesday the just made their decision
you won this lawsuit and this girl of evil to have
so he through her lawyer issued a statement she said i've been waiting for more than a month since i made my decision it's been very difficult to wait in the shelter for news that the judges in washington d c have given me permission to proceed and then she said that she was touched by the show of love from people from all over the country who wrote to her
her and then she said this is my life my decision i want a better future i want justice seems like it's always when it comes down to in the and are women are girls going to get to make the decision themselves about what their future is going to look like and with all of the you know moral dilemmas and disagreements that abortion
gives rise to and i know those are deep seated there's always is this question about what it what it looks like to actually for someone to have a baby when they don't want to do that and how how you can ever square of auschwitz letting women choose their own future
so i want to tell a story about why it is there no living people on us currency
based on some a story to one of my colleagues michael waters wrote for most obscure you're worried about there being a donald trump
troll dollar bill
we're no longer a eighteen sixty six law that prevents any living person from being on us currency why that's perfect
prevent for every job drove the congress will never pass can't pass the healthcare reform that are going to pass
currency reform either they're not going to rid of the penalty for example this story begins with a man named spencer clark and spencer clark was brand
the superintendent of the national currency bureau from eighteen sixty two eighteen sixty eight and while he was the superintendent he became a very controversial figure for sort of harvey weinstein reasons he he the treasury under his watch became court a house for orgies and buck and olds he was accused of hiring
women based on their looks rather than their ability
he one woman told congress had offered her first one hundred dollars than ten times that amount for a tryst with her
which is a lot of money
i guess he was ahead of the current just take one of those take one of those bills as monetary on many more money but so but this that's not why that's why we ended up here so in eighteen sixty six one of the with the wars of a war
having wreak havoc with all sorts of things and the economy they were shortage of metals and so there were there isn't enough medal for coinage and so the us decided to print fractional currency they were printing bills and small amounts and including the five cent bill and god i'm so glad we don't have that anymore
which is really dumb because there was a nickel
so
there was also having that there was a three cent bill also god
and so congress passed congress because well they passed a law said william clark
should be on the five cent bill william clark with get a picture of william clark up there wearing parkas of course the great explorer of lewis and clark
he was going to get his place on piddling asked denomination but still that he was going to be on the five cent bill now let's get a picture of spencer clark up there you'll notice that spencer clark and william clark have the same last name
they're not related they're not the same person however but the instructions came over from congress and just said that someone named clark had to be on the bill and so what happened is that spencer clark for going over next photo
had himself printed on the five cent know you just that better beard he does have a he's very he looks like he belongs on us currency
but this to no it was in circulation and congress went crazy and in eighteen sixty six shortly after this bill was printed they pass a law saying no living person could be on us currency but what was there is actually a coda which is that they neglected in passing that bill to actually get rid of the five
sent build clark so they had to go back and has a second bill which which stop them from printing the five cent note with censor clark on it but so you have to admire a man who had the moxie to get the us government to put put out bills with his own face on them
that's a show for today the political
frank a researcher is is he rode faith smith who you met earlier organize this live show and thanks to the risk in theater for hosting us and
follow us follow us on twitter athlete
