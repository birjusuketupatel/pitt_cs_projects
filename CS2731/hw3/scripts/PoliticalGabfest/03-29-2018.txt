hello and welcome to the fleet political gab fact that pardon me edition for march twenty nine twenty eight and i'm emily bath john and david are where they are off on vacation but who needs them anyway because i'm here with a two excellent
das du mal gooey who is the chief political correspondent for sleep page now
hello and jacket who is a co host of uncivil game let's amazing pod cast about the hidden history of the civil war which you should all go and download as soon as you finish listening to the show a jack thanks for joining a regimental okay on this week's show we are going to talk about three topics the trip
administration has a plan to add a question about citizenship to the twenty twenty census a bunch of states and civil rights groups are suing over this idea why is this a very big deal
our second topic the legal plot surrounding donald trump thickens i think maybe we could have that is like a tagline every week but
miller the new york times is reporting that trumps erstwhile lawyer john dowd dangled the possibility of a presidential pardon in front of former campaign manager paul matter for it and national security advisor for a nanosecond michael flynn before they were indicted and influence case pled guilty
so doubt isn't actually trumps layer anymore trump is looking for new lawyers we can talk about how much we think that we should care about that and then finally there is another whole legal subplot going on involving stormy daniels her accusations that trumps lawyer michael cohen paid her
hush money her efforts to get out of her non disclosure agreement and the entry into the story of her lawyer michael of a naughty who is a kind of enjoyable character in this drama which is packed with too many characters okay and then our third topic is the partisan gerrymandering case that was before the supreme court this week this one is from
maryland it's the second part isn't gerrymandering case that the court has heard this term why is this issue back and front of the court and what did we learn from oral argument this week and of course will have cocktail chatter commerce secretary wilbur ross announced this plan to add a question about citizenship to the census ross said he was prosper
wanting to a request from the justice department that the citizenship data would be would help the justice department better enforce the voting rights act we can discuss that rationale on a minute
there are a dozen states and civil rights groups who are suing and they are saying correctly that the constitution says the census has to count all persons and the argument is that by adding us question about citizenship the census bureau would interfere with this mandate to count everybody because the count is going to go down and the state
aids in particular are claiming harm because this if there's a diminished count and that law affect their ability to be able to get government benefits for their citizens jamal marco rubio a saying that this is like a big freak out by liberals like what's the big deal asking about citizenship it's just going to be the last question on the form on
your alarm scale how high does this register
i think this was a pretty pretty serious thing having cure
count of the people in the country is a recipe for miss allocating resources then when the people who were going to be counted or
fortunately hispanic or and american or low income this hers
andrew level stroessner because the everything the says huge for his reapportionment crush congressional representation
and needing assistance of course courtroom makes roy
there were given give him under term of those region groups which will in the in reapportionment shifting power away from urban centers or wave from put on with are more communities
the deal
from the idea that this is just liberal freak out with this was overblown
is isn't by the fair past census bureau chiefs people who are intimately familiar with the census have also been sounding the alarm and saying no we really shouldn't have in the courtroom the senses
right i mean that was actually a bipartisan responds by farmer census directors right and they talked about they called it highly risky to introduce this kind of questions so late in the process as part of the stack just like a problem of making this change at the last minute
well that's that's one of the arguments with the experts are saying but the effect this could have beyond what jumbos you saying about reapportionment zone
summit simply california might lose an entire congressional sued texas would game seven seats in the state house of representatives so there would be a huge shift in power and allow minority white districts to retain power in minority majority places the other thing is that new test
did this a couple of times in other kinds of census experiments and i was reading about one where not understand latino counts but estimates of good every census because of this panic so it went down pointed out to go over
is identified by the road and writing detained or deported accidently outing one of your relatives so there's a lot of people who are legitimately could be counted as citizens who are terrified that answer the question mood so we're now putting this question on the senses and then the question is are you a citizen of the united states it's that simple
and so they've done these tests and the accounts are amazing
one point in the middle of the census questioning the woman just ran out of the house and another case when they came back the family had moved away so it's clear that it's going to cause panic and it will definitely drive down numbers that are already going down by a big amount the other thing to say here is that like this idea comes from people
chris go back and other really radical right pepe mean loving republicans it's been promoted by the guy who was briefly nominated to be the head of the census by trump was a guy who literally wrote a book arguing against competitive elections he actually thinks like having no car
petition just straight up handing the seat to republicans is the way to go so yeah there's a lot at stake here so the sexes did a study and eight showed that there is already as you are saying a groundswell of concern about data sharing and confidentiality citing you know fears of a sudden and what's happening with the
dreamers right now particularly among spanish speaking arabic speaking residents of the united states
that makes me wonder if one argument here is like already people are scared and nervous and so leg so what so adding that question like we've implicitly made people think so much more about citizenship is a mark of residency or belonging is actually adding the question really it's own harm or to
ask this question in a different way has a triumph administration effectively already won because even if this gets tied up in court and the citizenship question doesn't go on the census there's all this news and fear and alarm about it that is already dead and depressed account to melody you think about that problem you know i think that's a get suffer observation
the effect has already is already there there will be like most likely a greater undertone of these communities
for the twenty twenty senses
yeah i know i'm not sure how one would prefer instead the it's actually interesting or have mrs extremely or door but
go for it
college classmates who are either four million documented and no longer and argument third or are engaged in one
however activism room and pictures are a very vocally say no we have to become for the senses
so my hunch just hmm
go loans is that effort to convince his communities to participate or already are going but normally of and you're right
the damage has already been done the consideration has been so successful instilling fear in these new news that when has come to room
why people are just american are just to want to participate in the us code it says personal information cannot be used against respondents the census by any government agency or court but if you're inclined to be worried about this you might note that during world war two the census bureau gave the names and addresses of japanese him
americans to the secret service and that was part of the information used around people up and put them into detention camps so you know one of the other rationales the champ administration gave as well we asked a question about citizenship between eighteen twenty and nineteen fifty on the census what's the big deal bringing it back currently we ask on the american coming
the survey which goes to one in six households we ask about citizenship there so i guess again i'm just asking like is this as big a deal as big a difference as people say what's the argument to kind of push back against that history will during obama is handling of this right and in two thousand and ten
and again you know the drill the republicans thread to under fund you know the census in his eyes
his emigration cohort rigorously pursued their jobs throughout the census and obama literally said like don't know that i worry the are they went ahead with the count so on some level maybe i mean we don't know just how big a freak out it's gonna be but we did go through this and two thousand and ten and ice was in full force and people get
counted maybe not
according to sampling maybe not at the levels that they should have been straight any money thing that struck me about ross's let our with that it was very carefully written right so here's this rationale that like we need citizenship voting age population data and order ten forest the voting rights act if you were going to take
that argument
he would say like it's true that there's a litigation around latino representation in states like texas and the questions is how do you make sure that you're not diluting the power of the minority vote you look at citizenship voting date and or to make sure you have enough people who actually can vote as opposed to just people who are latino but can't vote
and yeah it's just so hard to take out trump administration concern about the voting rights act at face value that is the greatest argument from the trump administration since they fired james komi on the grounds that he was unfair to hillary exact thing that actually we have these arguments that like seems a reasonable and yet
you know though it struck me reading this letter that the trip administration has come a long way from the travel ban and what i mean by that is like that roll out was so ham fisted on it was such a mass such obvious problem now and we see government agency is doing things that seem to have fairly sinister connotations
they do it much more skillfully so i'm also thinking of the news this week that scott pruitt the head of the said you know what we're only gonna look at studies where the dina is transparent we care a lot about transparency so what does this mean it means that studies that have been crucial to looking at pollution and chemical exposure often use confidential
health data that can't be made public because it's like people's confidential health data and so you have this seemingly very benevolent rationale about transparency being turned to this other use general do you feel like that
the folks who are running these federal agencies are figuring out how to do their jobs they're just getting more competent i think that's right
think more than the year into the trumpet and the mushroom this point in with the case of the political appointees especially be sympathetic beer her to move in third with administration just more serve the skill and what they're doing grown more effective
subverting the mission to the institution to that's cool that's certainly true the department of the interior it's true that the department of justice
the thing the thing i always think about is this is the stuff that's going to take a generation to reverse yes i totally have been thinking about that because you know the twenty two thousand census those numbers stay with us and tell when you're thirty that's a long time even absent the citizens of question we have a census with budget cuts
no permanent director and so there's also just like this erosion and denigrating of government going on there's another sort of diabolical feature to this particular question and it's long term impact besides sort of luring congressional seats on the democratic side and raising them on the republicans said there's another level in which you
can kind of gerrymander districts using the voting rights act so you can create a republican majority district by vote and a democratic majority district by numbers so if you put in so say you have a fifty two to forty eight percent democratic
the majority district but if you make seven percent of them non voting non citizens than you actually have what looks like a democratic majority district but in fact it's a republican so it's a it's another tool in the short of gerrymandering quiver totally and this is related to this on principles one person one vote
and how we interpret it and the supreme court settled this question very recently there's this case called evan well vs abbott brought by the way by edward bloom the same guy who is very good at challenging affirmative action in various universities around the country and this was this open questions i'm now that and never been saddled does one person one vote actually mean
like one human being or does it mean someone who is eligible to vote are likely to vote and the supreme court said one human being but one of the reasons was that the census didn't count citizens and sell the data of wasn't as reliable of the data we have from the american community survey and so another sort of like lingering
question here is whether there's you know in line with the crisper back agenda of require proof of citizenship and boating you could also go back and open up that president about one person one vote and change how can people i really see this as part of in the united states is becoming more
racially diverse this growing cohort of non white americans are more liberal booting even if the identify conservatives they have less conservative views on a variety of issues and really be only hope for the kind of traditional hardline conservative agenda is true making sure
sure that white americans a number two
a white americans and rule x herb and places maintain kind of a group from political power in all of this to me from not just gerrymandering congressional districts put this attempt to turn of the census to the occasional every couple years a republican long republican lawmaker summer
our focus idea of allocating an electoral votes on the basis of congressional districts
nice to meet to be like him actual effort to attempt to germans are american democracy writ large to ensure a kind of fake extend little dominance of a cohort of white americans in their to politics yeah it really struck me this particular statistic i found that in the twenty
twenty cents census for the first time people are predicting that the weight share of the population that's going to fall below sixty percent and maybe it's anxiety over and that shift that striving lot of that so i'm glad you brought that up to now i mean i think democrats are in a very tough place trying to argue that counting citizens is a bad idea it just doesn't sound good on television
one but also just watching pelosi some of the others react to this it's amazing how incompetent the democrats are at trying to frame account or issue so what did she do that you thought was lame so she said you know like this is going to hurt vulnerable communities
she other people's of all night exactly as she said trump is putting politics over the constitution that's precisely what they want to hear he's stirring things up
the other thing she said was like you know he's not listening to the experts
the three points that could not possibly failed better than those three so how what what
pelosi is crap message craft or what would you recommend a couple of things one is that there was this really radical right police chief and in los angeles named darryl gates from years ago member him yeah so he actually had this special order that he made to all the cops which is under no circumstances where there to enquire to some about someone's immigration status the reason being is
it would cause a spike in crime that if you drove people away from cooperating with with law enforcement institutions and other things like that that basically would make his job harder and so there's a whole crowd
a law and order argument in favor of making an accurate count of the people and not just citizens
yeah you could get caught to step up to that there are also a huge number of republicans who oppose this change because they're from states where their districts are going to be disadvantaged after the count made alabama might lose a whole new jersey is the republicans there are vehemently against the so i mean there are republicans
you could put forward so that it looks like an unfair change in the census ray and changed the complexion of the way the the whole debate happens rather than playing and specifically to the trunk voters worse desired i can
offer that advice other for an entity little see i'm sure she's that's your hand
oh i get to our second topic i just want a t s r deflate class topic today jack and to now are going to come up with an excellent food and cooking advice for me and for you to slay plath kinds of things that i don't have time to figure out myself they are going to figure it out for us and i also wanted to remind our listeners that the gap that has a lie

i second topic sell we have this news story this week about john dad champs erstwhile layer offering to pardon man for it and flan it's the took me reading this news potential say that dowd denied that it seems at once totally bizarre and not normal and yet i'll sell i could imagine
currently going on tv the next day and being like yeah we did that so why and in fact i found a tweet from july and which chubb said all agree the us president has the complete to power to part in so jack what do you think the political consequences of this story about this dangle of a pardon offer are gonna be well will there be any
i think the thing to watch for with of doubt lawyers up in the next couple of weeks because one argument hate when argument is that he was he quit because he was he was afraid the meal was coming after him
i mean the thing to remember here is a trunk and say all this stuff because he's the president of the united states he can probably get out of this but these other people they're living in our world where the law still matters
and you can't just buffalo your way through these arguments and endowed maybe one of those people to me that i'm not clear to he i mean the rumor is maybe he quit because of this pardon thing or that he was forest our out of the others
it's not clear why exactly he quit but it is clear that he's left with essentially a bunch of radio talk show hosts and sluggish blow hards like michael cohen to be legal representation yeah amount you have any thoughts about the dad store i do you think should we care how whether chunk has like a really top high quality
layer in his corner so i don't know if we should care
it is interesting rape that the press the united states cannot get good legal representation
some would who
you know you would assume they're at least some top show from would want to represent the president but it into them have them do the three of us on this whole could get better legal representation right now than the president of the united states
come and find just reverse mean for yourself nobody would ever line efforts represent the attack
i'm very due to fund such moments
i just find a remarkable may well there some calculations so obviously you ever does this is going to be super famous and gets lots of attention and yeah you have a client who doesn't listen to you i mean that seems clear right i mean another possible reason for down leaving with and he was telling tramp not to sit for an interview with mahler and champ is insisting like i'm going to do a great job but that
despite his reputation for let's say inaccurate statements
and bolivia nation so there's that problem and then there's also the idea that chant could turn on you on any second and you become the goat and restore story for two theories about this one one is in a lot of a prominent law firms there are a number of women now her partner level and they're they're not to go wash on this yeah interest and the other one is that it
possibly may be the least and legal circles we've reached the tipping point of trumps dignity racing as josh marshall as it were like people fear that if they take this job rather than amplify their resume it's actually going to ruin them what gary coleman i mean there's a number of people now
who just wandering the earth
shell's of their former selves and and it's know the atlas taylor said tiller i mean people see these guys and they realize like in all likelihood that will be me if i take this job
so should we be worried and i have of criminal or constitutional terms about trumps layer dangling it's hard enough right let's assume this story is trail said there is this interesting piece on the blog just security this mean by alex waiting was a harvard law professor and he was making the ah
argument that a pardon dangle is different and actually more problematic legally speaking that an actual open pardon offer and sell weddings argument is that dowd dangling an offer before an indictment and guilty plea was done in secret done to discourage cooperation with an ongoing investigation without any kind
public scrutiny so you're saying like a promise don't worry trying to early on cut off whatever cooperation flynn is giving and manner for it could give and that we should actually analyze that differently legally speaking in terms of its constitutionality and the possibility that it could become part of an obstruction charge against our
god or against tramp if you could prove if dowd could then say that trump encouraged him to do this to say it but everything i've heard from legal scholars kind of concurs agrees with trump that he had the power is pretty absolute and there's really there's no good constitutional law behind any kind of restriction of it and so i don't know
giving it or dangling it i think doesn't matter it doesn't matter at least it's not clear gym outlets what are your thoughts any i don't have any particular expertise here although my intuition
is also the department of the president's pardon power is absolute this just gets district of the way in which could have been people around him but being essentially shameless have completely confounded the constitutional order that someone someone from system only work
if the people within it has some true shame which is a signal from should have commitments be armed themselves or even a commitment to their own jan's like self interest in that just an extremely narrow below since because doesn't have that the system initiative and a loss for what to do with him
intuitively we all kind of think that dangling a pardon in the face of an investigation is room even if it's not illegal he shoot you'd would imagine that a different president with some awareness of what this rate due to his party with this ring to to his agenda would refrain from taking
step because i'm only really thinks about himself in his of animal is stick my immediate security sense those considerations are in their way i mean i have to point out as always do or it does at this point in the conversation that if we had a congress that was willing to think hard about
what it means to have a president corrupt they use its power that you know impeachment is not narrowly defined legally but because the republicans in congress have so little interest and ness we end up having a conversation about what strictly unlawful in either criminal or constitutional terms and
you're right and we totally don't know the answer to the at their unsettled questions instead of having the more sort of like reasonable or easier to attain conversation about norms and what's right or wrong we end up with this conversation about like the galaxy and that precise meaning of corruptly impeding and investigation and the extra
action of justice federal statute you get the sense that in certain circles there are these norms people in those circles are abide by them are alarmed when they're breached and them as the president one more thing that i found really just striking about the story was that leaked i mean i and maybe this is the layer and me but
there's all kinds of attorney client privilege that should be relevant here the layers for a man afford and flynn who didn't comment in the times they shouldn't be the sources for this doubt shouldn't be the source like where did this come from did it come from champ are magnified are flynn one other staff members know about that
this idea i was really confounded by that question where wouldn't have come from i guess is there an advantage for men afford or flimsy council to to leak this doesn't make it does it maybe encourage trumped up to the park or mean is that a strategy for someone who's out to get john doubt i mean obviously read or is the worst from dowd he's the only one is dirt
leon the huck yeah the whole thing like that part of it bothered me
other people in the counsel's office that we're trying for vying for dad's job well done things they that way no because the white house counsel is like over there separately right medina yeah yeah i ran and even ty cobb is organizing how much to cooperate with mahler and what to turn over rate we have to talk just a little bit about stormy daniels her lawyer and michael
i am really enjoying his entry into the job
a particular character and type i'm so he is being super aggressive he's having a great time with his moment in the sun he this week filed a motion he want to depose trump to take his sworn testimony also wants to take the testimony of michael cullen trumps layer and this is off course about this one hundred and thirty thousand dollar payment made to daniel
days before the two thousand and sixteen election
jim now some commentators seem to feel like stormy daniels this is a side shell and it has a kind of like monica lewinsky possible feeling to it of far far from the russia investigation all it out the president sexual pack a day although it's like beneath us is that how you feel about or do you think there's something more substantive
but think
beneath us to pay attention to this desert least one actually quite serious concern that this raises which is that if the president and his team have been willing to spend large sums of money to cover up an affair what else
he has the as donald trump in his past spend large amounts of money to cover up how black male level is the president but beyond that i mean just thinking politically
significant know just that the president is can have caught in this scandal like a like everything i mean really like almost every every scandal this one has had gross staying power that's in part because of the daniels legal team has done a great job of keeping the story the news of releasing tip
bit of the tripping out information and kind of taking advantage of the media's should have
obsession with appetite appetites i couldn't resist and giving the when you live
seems fitting guess yes exactly as is ongoing we learn things like that this may not actually prevent daniels from from speaking if there are other women for whom trump is done this that also raises a question about their in the and their ability to speak publicly do you think this hasn't real pretty
henshaw of snowballing and also does affect the political situation that the republican party which is then forced the kind of and least addressing this defending the president's actions yeah that's really interesting the flow jap the idea that stymied daniels as using a strategy that champion fell fell masterful adding kind of
key thing that er bits of information at our class reality television that's how i understand store me is not as a legal question but as a competitor in the twitter sphere and in the attention markets today it's about campaign finance reform or maybe it's about defamation that's the new angle
again attack or ads against her out are getting liking her daughter out of a car to the gulag and then she is dropping one chrome at a time and she's doing to trump trump is is doing to the country this twitter constant twitter feed constant turning the story back to her understand the sixty minute show got better ratings than
every episode of the apprentice he knows that and it has to be galling right and so if you don't follow stormy on twitter you really should she is brilliant
fending off trolls she corrects their spelling when they come at her with vulgarity about her about what she does for a living she's super sex positive and just come right back at them vulgarity doesn't shame doesn't affect her because she is coming to this in this wide open way at the same way that tromp was
you know teflon candidate back when jab and marco and all these guys were trying to hurl insults at him you know she is doing to trump what he what he did that yeah you know as as someone who has written about sex work at me it is so gratifying to see a an actress and a business while men come forward and be
frank and forthright and to me credit ball and just as you're saying like an embarrassed and yeah she's doing a really good job of representing herself and she reminds me a lot of characters in the deuce and david simon i shall reign of out the point industry in times square in their seventy's like there's just
kind of openness to her the way she's presenting herself that i think it's just like really good one last thing will change them
taking a page from trumps own playbook is that apparently you know he does now have a nickname just like he gives other people nickname oh really president spanky
hey and family or even republicans them and in dc year now i didn't know that you know and i should have because i've been waiting for the nickname i feel like that's actually have been a problem for people a chance that he has been found much better and nickname that's true i thought benedict benedict donald would catch on
but i think presidents bank he has you know better i feel like that marchetti i have accolade and see where that goes to

very topic the lawsuit benefactor first known came to the supreme court this week this is a lawsuit over the six district in maryland which was redrawn and twenty eleven to boost the likelihood that the party would go from having on six democrats and to republican congress to seven democrat
rats and one republican and when he was asked about this redistricting plan in a deposition the democratic former governor of maryland mart no malley said yes i did my duty within the meats and bounds and maryland law to try it out my party he knew that this redistricting would be more likely to elect a democrat than or
public and that was clearly has intact so that america is on the record saying that just like republican lawmakers in north carolina have been on the record saying like yes we did political gerrymandering we thought it was perfectly legal so sue us and in fact and it in light of vaguely legal added has been perfectly legal exactly so jack should it content
due to be perfectly legal well so that's the question that maybe the supreme court is going to take up but even he has another line and there were he says of yeah i created this district to be more likely to elect a democratic and republican yes this was clearly my intent right so we're no make no mistake man no think about it he was saying what the supreme court said
which is which is distracting is purely a political act of political phenomenon and should be entirely handed off to the legislatures right he's also by the way in favor of reforming how we gerrymander but he's out of the closet saying yes i do it and which puts him a little bit ahead of some of the other guy
governors pretending like they're making a fair map by the way just to give you a sense of just how gerrymandered some of our states are doubly so pennsylvania which normally is a battleground state and the presidential elections meaning it's roughly fifty fifty is thirteen republicans out of eighteen seats north care
landis the same it's ten out of thirteen seats and republican in a battleground state so has huge effect this this case but the question is what can the supreme court do to change the partisan gerrymandering that goes on because it seems like fifty years ago maybe it was harder to gerrymander because there just wasn't good data
but the problem is now is that you can really fine tune the data so that you can actually move one house after another with these great computer programs and you can actually gerrymander every district to a fairly well i mean you can actually get precisely the exact vote it's no longer the voters selecting the representatives it's the representatives selecting they're on voter
wait and the answers your question luck in the supreme court do is the judges can use the same tools to analyze how much partisanship went into the gym and during how much this redistricting is based on party preference as opposed to that traditional principle is that some states put into law about you know how compact is the district doesn't respect existing
county and city lines are the lie are the district die in a manner that can take us out of said something that the supreme court can even solve i mean can you can you decide how much partisanship goes into a gerrymandering will doubtless like them i would say one a very few interesting moments in oral argument this week was this this question so in we have a long tradition of address
racial gerrymandering right but as i think chief justice roberts pointed out we don't say like okay a certain amount of racial discrimination enjoying district is okay but with political gerrymandering the courts are likely to say that as long as the district in many states remains in the hands of the legislatures and so i think
the hope if you want the courts to step in here is that they're going to start by saying well really extreme efforts of gerrymandering are unconstitutional and then you have two questions one is this question of intent which an alley was so nice to put on the record but presumably if the court start treating this and in marseille
aspect fashion future politicians are not going to say stuff like family said and then you just have like the various measures of part is any symmetry that different political scientists have come up with to look at and i mean to me it seems like you could wrestle through that there could be a whole bunch of lower court rulings and efforts to figure out which of these tasks or more
useful are you put together some composite of the tasks and not all seems like within the realm of the courts if they choose to do it to now what do you think about this from a kind of political as well was legal point of view because you know one of the arguments against worrying too much about part and gerrymandering as well
democrats or republicans have sorted themselves anyway and ten cities and rural districts and yes republicans have a geographic advantage but that's not something that court should worry about that something that you know the political system should address on its own are not addressed it could me isn't are you just doesn't take history and to accrue
the best example this is if you get actually the midwest right
and you get a map population
police reports and ship
you look at it
over them construed and cleveland or their country some temerity the
in chicago in milwaukee and so forth he sure you can say this just reflects care of the gertrude geographic for distribution of him their identities but if the overlay of our up over america population my race where you see is that all those democratic concentrations are mostly just black people the reasons why they're going to people cross train
the two particular census tracts in particular cities has everything to do with determination
violence and so and so forth for me at least that that raises a really important question which i do you want our system for district king to basically reinforce racial inequality
i understand that's probably not something that the court is terribly concerned with but as as politics and something to discuss of my public life
no we don't want that in that we should be looking for ways to make sure that it doesn't the narrowness of conversation divert gerrymandering i think frustrates me because
wilbur deal yeah are dealing with a broad question about that kind of democracy want to have for my part it is not great that if you happen to live in a city
if you happen to live in a good neighborhood
essentially begins to mean very little of the scheme of things can i just say that there is another solution or at least one kicking around which is that voters themselves even ones in districts that they like are repelled by the idea that they can't have they don't get a choice i going to give a shout out to a republican governor
larry hogan of maryland who actually filed an amicus brief against himself and his state in favor of and nine nonpartisan commission being created to draw the maps and so that's one thing this happening and some of the states is that the voters are demanding that the redistricting be taken away from the legislature
and given to a nonpartisan committee and i don't know if that solves the problem but one thing it will do is that will make those sort of like unsightly the the jerry the salamander portion of the gerrymandering metaphor
less likely so if you look at like pennsylvania
a bunch of a lot of these districts around say pittsburgh are these big rural was taking a small bite out of pittsburgh to dilute urban power it looks ridiculous if you just look at the current map and if you look at the map that the courtroom the pennsylvania new supreme court yeah didn't play the maps that they drew it's largely just like this clump here
this clump there it it looks right the other one doesn't look right in there is a visual component to this that i think would be harder to pull off if you had a bipartisan committee saying like come on bob look at look at this area and ridiculous yeah i mean the nonpartisan commissions and in some states like california and six ass fall
measured in terms of how many competitive races there are which is a pretty good way of thinking about their funding and can also think about fairness of edging toward proportional representation
one argument against the supreme quiet finding a way for courts to a gas parties and jay mandarin as well states should all have non tires and commissions and if the courts can't many this problem that will push mar states and that direction at an hour had strikes you to now i'm actually fine without a if you would asked me this five years ago
or eight years ago my inclination to say yeah this is this is a fundamentally win a prize in that it should remain in brooklyn and price but as the technology is true and more sophisticated i think that in itself is a very
important change that for me means that maybe we should take the center of the hands of politicians are at least take the hands of partisan entities and put it into the hands of i think ethel accountable institutions in the missile accountable to voters but it isn't
directly consumer product and personal concerns and asked want to add to this conversation is there seems to be adequate representation in general there are three hundred and twenty plus million people in the country but we have four hundred thirty five oxygen
viruses in the house and think that ratio makes these conversations over gerrymandering regular for british even more fraught this just isn't limited pool of potential representation there are a variety of schemes that would say increase in size by fifty seats are sexy see through seventy seeds
in those has been largely distributed pretty evenly across the country that's right and saying yeah and that's a nonpartisan obviously york i mean yeah it it would be it's a kind of situation or california we get like you know thirteen additional seats but texas bucket nine and in georgia would give three and it would all kind of bounty they are balance each other out taken nationally
and i have one my observation i want to make about the supreme court so one of the questions why did the quiet take this maryland case since it already had a j mandarin case from wisconsin and when the quiet check the case my assumption was think well if they're going to find that there's no way for cards to do anything
you don't need a second case sell it seems like maybe the idea was to have a case where i democratic gerrymander was being challenge and that would provide some political cover for addressing this problem but i had her thigh about this after all our argument so that the key vote on the court is justice kennedy on this case presumably
justice briar seems in favor of finding some kind of role for quarks and policing parties and giant mandarin he flirted a couple of times in argument the idea of let's kick this today calendar for next year let's hear wisconsin in maryland and the north carolina case and think about
all van together and what kinds of remedies we could have that would address the different kinds of gerrymandering the different kinds of proof we had a cases and first i was think rolling my eyes at this idea i mean really like we need to do this all over again and then i thought her if they have to do it over again that would be reason for justice candy to stay on the supreme court next year
there have been rumours as their had them for the last few years that he is about to retire in this is a big deal issue one that he has written about in the path and seems to care about ally and i wonder if just as by as a sort of alternative motivation here that's some serious triple bank shot
evidence suggests just like why did it
this conspiracy exactly
the thing about you mentioned kennedy
as i understand it his argument is it excessively partisan gerrymandering
disfavor favors different people's first amendment rights radioactive to express your political opinion as an association
if you marginalize a whole group based on their political association you violated their the first and emirates yes and she has a really cool way to to think about it yes and that is actually the main argument of the challengers and the maryland case that was another possible reason why they added this case the dock at you're absolutely right

remarks
getting paid back size of the night
people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars to now a new further recovering from your called over the weekend and ready to shrink i don't know what maybe bourbon bourbon seems like a good thing to drink with having some look
and spread fear cause bad for your throat when you're recovering from a cold
what will i be chattering about so i have recently been on this michael mann kick director michael man i've just been watching a bunch of michael mann films and the one thing i wanted to one so i to recommend is two thousand and four as collateral which a fuel
is it can be expensive movie that has two big stars jamie fox and tom cruise but this basically manage from the cultural radar
it is this a strangely into action movie action movie
you can imagine the pig solution to make a thriller involving one of the biggest stars in hollywood but when it turned out to be as it's like very cerebral very tense film for the first hour and a half day in to conclusion
becomes a kind of late michael mann does is take of jason voorhees movie with tom cruise playing the monster at the end it's very strange in very interesting i would highly recommend it i also recommend man's follow up to collateral which which is two thousand and six miami vice film is extremely strong
change
currently deconstruct good action film where the action is incidental to the entire narrative and everything's about atmosphere and feel and mood and it also star is jamie foxx than him and and cone feral as though is the white guy in this case highly recommend them if you're looking for gestured of quasi experimental
mainstream movies that check out which is what i do when i'm sick jack are you going to need shattering about a very direct that's what i have been chattering about is this writer television producer
anthony horowitz i read a book by him
oh by the way back up and say like occasionally i will run into something that i really like like for instance when i saw mark or islands and chrome well i had read the hillary mantles books and love that show and then i found myself just basically renting every market islands movie so lately best us our been doing stuff so i read mag by
murders which is this sounds like a really dopey book because it's a book about him a book editor editing a mystery novel and then the novelist in the book gets killed it sounds as if you know it sounds super lucky i read it and us really enjoyable it's really good yeah and i thought he really outsmarted me
what i was expecting the narrative to go and where i thought like maybe this is going to be a little too clunky when he marries the the the fictional world with the non fictional world and a really really pulls it off it was really entertaining already the head and then i found myself a while back slipping into a british television series called foils war
which if you haven't seen is fantastic it's about a detective trying to hold loan or together in the middle of a or and right afterwards turns out every one of those episodes was written by anthony horowitz and then i just picked up my wife and i are sherlock holmes freaks and were reading together right now
turns out that that's also written by inherit and i really just kind of like a winner is at the same guy op and it's all the same yeah it's not like five people so this is an accidental sort of marker islands thing where i'm i'm suddenly wake up to minors and the but i will say that for this kind of middle brow kind of mystery plotting he he is better than average i mean much
better with them with the show of hands book the certain expectations you have when you're reading a sherlock holmes books like of sherlock holmes is not in the story then he's in the sky somewhere in the story right and he's already he's already messed with me on that one throughout the book he knows what you're sort of narrative expectations are and is fooling with those while you're reading
or watching the show so anyway recommend of course i well those are tough match my fan fantastic the nine i'm gonna play my usual legal nerd wrong
i am really interested in our petition for the supreme quiet by brandon gaseous sell branded as he may remember is that teenager in the documentary making a murderer and if you saw that documentary or just catch their spit on line his interrogation is desk completely terrifying moment in which he
she's this kid who doesn't totally understand what's going on and the police lead him to implicate himself and ness like murder and it seems apparent that he is powerfully confessing and yet he was convicted on in part based on this video tape deposition so his petition to the supreme court with rectify that
that injustice i mean to me watching the video tape it just seems so apparent that something some travesty as a current that i can't believe the lower courts didn't figure out a way to overturn the connection but they didn't and more broadly his lawyers or at least like that various friend of the court briefs are arguing that what the supreme court should really be doing it said
a standard for how juveniles can be interrogated one that recognizes the same science about adolescent brain development that has led supreme court justices in particular justice kennedy to worry about death sentence says and life without parole sentences for juvenile so i'll be really interested to see if the supreme court t
makes this case and also in law suit watching land maryland and dc got through the very first round of the monuments clause suit against top so this is the suit that says that because champ owns a stake in you know various businesses and particular at the trump hotel in the us postal office
building think that that maryland and dc have had businesses that have been harmed by this competition and that because the president isn't supposed to be able to accept gifts and arguments that this should be illegal sell will be interesting to see what kind of depositions and evidence gathering discovery the judge allows in that case
so far it's alive eleven my can simply create one of those charts who we have all the sort of zones of lawsuits that are going after the president because you've got a monuments you've good stormy is now doing this sort of a defamation thing but that was also defamation was also jessica drake has our call
yeah some are know some of the average dumber drake was a harassment right right and then you good schneiderman the new york going after some of these real estate things and then you've got mueller of course school and after whatever money laundering collusion something obstruction it just seems like pretty much every zone of the presidency
of legal pursuit somehow has a lawsuit diameter
and for all this we can thank of course paula jones who run your sued bill clinton the supreme court said no it is not too distracting to forest the president to be the target of us have a lawsuit while he's in office and you saw that storm has is now insisting on a deposition guess the best reality show
