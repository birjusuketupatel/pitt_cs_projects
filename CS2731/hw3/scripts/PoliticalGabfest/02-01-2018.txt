i think anyone is still a thing will fit
the f b i russia story has taken on the quality of a tell a novella each day brings so many twists and turns that is impossible to keep up
i will try to capture a few of them just in the last day or so then comes the
news of the the rumor that a former trump official more corolla it's going to testify that hope hicks
suggested that the email to donald trump junior had sent about the legendary russia meeting and trump tower would never get out and play some element of struck the injustice perhaps also in the last day or so comes news that devon newness as memo which has been sent over the white house for approval
may have been altered and republicans really wasn't altered except trivial a but if it was altered doesn't need to be approved by congress also comes news that peter struck the f b i agent to suppose that anti trump bias is poisoning the f b i and subjecting into investigation was in fact one of the leading people fighting
to get the hillary clinton
i email investigation reopened right before the election and wrote the letter that there is a widely regarded as costing having coughed hillary clinton the election
there's so much other stuff the f b i chief chris ray has taken the remarkable step a publicly opposing the release of the nunez memo meanwhile the president's lawyer seem to be positioning themselves to project
special counsel bob mahler's request for direct interview with the president there and literally forgot i was ready my notes down that after we taped last week was the revelation that the president had tried to fire the special counsel it was only stopped when when his lawyer dom again threaten to resign if you did that when more thing which is it called episode kept it as tax last week and they sadness and and
a feminist
anyway i hate like literally as we were close it finishing up at the show
it was able to recover that it's just an extraordinary spectacle i continue to have doubts whether this is where democrats should want to spend all of their time but it don't seem to be aware of the media spending all of time can you can you find a theme in this putting in this kind of garbage pile of horror show whatever
mech metaphor i'm gonna mix here can you find a theme for us
well one game i think it's really important is the institutional prerogative and just kind of basic doing its job of the administrative state in particular i had the f b i and the justice department and the extraordinary spectacle of champs handpicked after i a director christopher array
saying like he has to defend his institution from devon nunez and from present and jump from this effort to discredit the f b i it's as if whatever the f b i is doing to investigate russian meddling in the election
it's as if from the point of view of the president and his allies that stopping that is worth burning down house basically it's very confusing to watch an institution which is led by people who travel packed which is in the executive branch have to take this stance against champ and against me
nice as if they were on opposite sides when in fact it looks like the afghan the justice department
these figures chris re run steam they are people who jumped hired presumably they're not eager to be out there taking this stance against him and i really feel like they must feel like they don't have any choice
i think i think and matter it doesn't matter because i think what emily is saying when you have a president in engaged with another branch of government in an effort to undermine the f b i in a broad way this is not just to say there was a bad apple here or about apple of their it's a really to throw a broad
skepticism over the f b i and to get more support for this idea that there is a deep state at the guy that was trying to to meddle in the election and keep donald trump from being president we should known as i mentioned last week if there is such a deep state and in all corners of the i they did a terrible job of keeping donald trump from being present
and they did such a bad job that perhaps they should be fired for malfeasance because the memo that was released eleven days before the election certainly contributed hillary clinton thinks the cost of the election it's certainly contributed to her rose in the final eleven days of the election and so they were trying to keep donald trump the deep state which in
this narrative is so all powerful the fact that they helped donald trump
in that very public way seems to me that they did a terrible job at being deep state participants may than this latest news about peter struck wine to reopen the investigation to cleanse emails and drafting the letter that call me earliest right before that two thousand and sixteen elections which are so damaging to clinton all that suggests that whatever reservation
stock had about champ becoming president which he clearly expressed in the text messages he had some other duty he saw his overriding i mean if you pick of like he was actually in a position to make a decision that would have a favorite clinton and he made the opposite call i don't
personally i think that guy in public at that moment was the right call but it certainly wasn't just that whatever political affiliations and preferences he had they were not determined to dev in his judgment and in a partisan the that's right as i read the reporting and i've only seen the and and reporting on this though i think there's an important distinction
and struck lawn in the investigation to happen which supports your point of view which is he wanted to investigate these new sets of emails where he had some debate is whether there with this should be made public and tell congress if he had qualms about it being made public what that connects with his the department of justice policy which says
make something public in a way that is going to have a potentially destabilizing effect on an election and the reason that matters and figuring out that is that there was a report this week and both why shouldn't post and the wall street journal that andrew mackay the number two at the f b i was being investigated by the inspector general of the
by for taking a month
when these emails that were found on and any means
laptop for taking a month before notifying congress that they were being looked into it
his defenders say that's because he was exercising the regular standard operating procedure of the department of justice
others who say know these shows the fix was in to try to cool things for hillary clinton so she could win the way i mean one thing i've been running about is it sounds like this inspector general part is going to be critical of mccain that that was part of why you know abrupt raid departed this week and if it contained that is true that
seems like the best rap and for a new nathan trump and describing the f b i and yet the haven't been talking about that much it's confusing to me maybe that's because it's not yet clear what's in it and maybe it's because the criticisms don't fall neatly along partisan lines because of the issues you were just talking about i mean commie really does
did we talked about the time and he really did depart from the regular rules both in the press conference he had the summer before the election and then in october let are still sorting through those questions about the timing of the investigation becoming public seems really important to me to figure it out and i hope
inspector general port will do that in a way that seems like truly neutral on has the institutional kind of rules and norms at heart well i mean john what do you think i just wonder if this is like an act of desperation that is just
maybe it's not a good place for democrats to put all their energy but i wonder if republicans are going to be sorry that they went down this road to i don't know how the politics play out i think the that one thing you have obviously is that you could imagine
whatever is in this memo being used to begin the case to get rid of rosenstein and then replace and by somebody who would fire muller now where am i getting that from that's from joe mansion the west virginia andrews on the intelligence committee who we talked to this week and who said that's what to look for another theory i've heard is that this effort
is a way to kind of broadly do discredit the f b i and then use that as a pretext for claiming that mahler's not on the level and therefore why should the president talked to him and don't know if we've talked about this on the show but for a president who is plays so fast and loose with the truth washington post counted over two thousand
misstatements lies on truce and otherwise from the president it's hard to imagine what an interview with a special counsel would be like it's almost certain that the president would say something that could get him into trouble and so if you're a lawyer and i wonder what your thoughts about this emily whether you would ever let your client go into such as
situation those are two possible options for what is happening with this memo i think there is another option which is the memo never gets released what's more powerful a memo with claims that can be rebutted buddy the director or remember that never gets published and then people can say well i mean if only it had been published we would know the true virulence of the
crimes that the f b i and now that it isn't you know it can become in people's imagination whatever they choose to one guy i would have thought that would have been the way to go except that they already voted to release like already going down this road i mean i guess like trump could stop it that just seems he does not seem him to do that it's not as character right and i kept thinking that
from his point of view and there so many examples of this rate this idea of any astros and stan are you on my team like where he just math find this like we have well we i have these bedrock assumptions about the norms that govern the president relationship with the justice department and the f b i and carefully worked out
balance since watergate that gas these institutions are within the executive branch but the president is very careful to stay away from anything that would seem like interfering an investigation i mean to determine trump this is clearly just incredibly frustrating and stupid and he just doesn't buy it and some fundamental level of the notion that like he's going to be the
one to stand in front of the memo out on the right
i was listening to a slow burn the really wonderful slate pod cast about the watergate affair i can't wait to listen to the last episode of that has gotten better and better as it's it's fantastic and what's really interesting about what happened with nixon is that the crimes that nixon
was accused of and with guilty of are somewhat analogous to some of the things that people are talking about with trump and in particular the find the smoking gun tape that took him down was nixon
proposing that that tell the to shut down and f b i investigation so it was something similar meddling in places the president shouldn't be meddling but where he did prove also have authority to do it but what was really interesting about the fall of nixon is that hear you had a president who was really pop
killer and it was also by most
reasonable standard a pretty good president someone who who has no interest did good stuff was really interested in policy was innovative on policy had a lot widespread popular support for a lot of what he was doing
and and that he even but there were so much danger to the institutions and norms of the country that that threat was so powerful that even members of his own party felt they couldn't support him the justified the removal of a good and successful president trump isn't good and six
president trump is a is a bad president who is not very good on policy
effective he's not helping the republican brand at all is not really clear why the republican party is so willing to defend that and to defend the destruction of the institutions yes it is clear and know is with them he as eighty percent and the higher approval ratings and my my my god like
pence president mike pence would have just as high approval and would be a lot more competent yeah but that has is believed to have and does have a connection has base and all of that is boosted by railing media and until that changes think this is the way it is so he is the president we elected president and you also forget the events between
been getting from trump as president to penn since president would cause extraordinary disruption them in that base and would not let which would not be good for those lawmakers on the republican side who made that happen they would suffer all the while while trying to get present trump i guess in this is honoring i think that was that was absolutely true nixon as
well that was true and the knicks and i don't know and there wasn't even close and the next time
yeah the republicans had a blood bath and seventy four and seventy six they were destroyed and then six years later
but but but the partisanship of today is nowhere close to the way it was in i mean you had moderate republican you had moderate republicans in in the nineteen sixties or in the early nineteen seventies and way you don't really have them today and then also the power of the base in both parties but but most particularly the power of the
base in the republican party and fealty required or else you'll get a primary opponent financed by outside groups and supported by media and social media that all didn't exist back then in the way it does today yeah no that's all and by the way through and that you know the cowardice that
it's been demonstrated is proof of that and it just is amazing to me that the level of destruction the level of threat to institutions that republicans basically support and think are good for the country is incredible
only an unwillingness the unwillingness to resist that so far is bizarre to me i think and so worrisome
you give to other things one it wasn't really until the june twenty third tape came out i mean there was a smoking gun and there was sterile million
none and and secondly you have a republican party that finds the president perhaps distasteful but they like the tax cut bill that passed they like what's happening in judicial appointments and this courses in addition to the points we just made about partisanship they like to direction in which judicial appointments are going and
and they like the supreme court pic of course as well so and they liked the fact that a lot of regulations are going away and that at the
and the rest of them regulations and the entire direction of those agencies is being reversed from the obama years so there's a great deal for republicans to like that's pretty generic republican viewpoints on all those things with the axe and on by the way on immigration but then the only thing where
there's an there's a distance there would be on trade but most friendly policies are all pretty much in keeping with what republicans like right but that doesn't that is actually has nothing to do with with with what we're talking about you are assuming that we are just like trade in for a no announcement and that going around know melodrama it
nato is the two thousand and twenty they're gonna lose the twenty two thousand election they're going to get a good chat about they're going to get crushed in two thousand and eighteen and that's going to happen and it's going to have been worse the more they're attached to trump but i thought you were saying he didn't why there that they didn't like the policies that he's supporting and they do well you are saying is a bad president which is a more global a statement they
like ish the policy supporting but he's embarrassing the party and he's making he's he's making the i don't think there are many republicans who think that donald trump as a president is a better president for the country or for the republican party than mike pence would be if you could just imagine magically said could achieve a magic wand maybe they'd way that they absolutely cannot
it's not how it works and they're deeply aware of that can i say one more thing steal one more thing from slow burn that really jumped out at me when a special counsel was a to investigate knicks and it was archibald cox who was this like harvard bow tie wearing liberal i am now stealing directly from leon on his show
nixon did not go after him on partisan grounds it just like didn't occur to them to try to argue that cox was is an unbiased i mean if muller was a cox like figure just imagine what would be happening and there is something illustrative in detail about the distance we've traveled
and what what what partisanship is coming to mean
i continue to think that this investigation is audrey flu super important in yet
is the wrong tree
to be barking up trump trump a terribly corrupt person he is obstructed justice it looks to me he is probably his campaign probably colluded attempted to collude with russians to affect the election all of that i think he's committed impeachable offense probably every day he's been in office practice
but it's if democrats wish to damage the presidency and and restore themselves to power and and make a political comeback it's spending their time on trumps policies on the republican policies
not on this stuff this stuff it's just confusing and model some and you know i know it has to be done because it's so law but i just don't think i think of an local
operative right now i'll just say that like a non later went to law school i'm much less shorter than you are that of those nefarious things about trump are true but i deeply care about finishing this investigation and finding out whatever mahler has to tell us because that's rule of law basic principle the the president is subject
to the laws just like everyone else i feel like that matters enormously and it may not be the best way to win the two thousand and eighteen or twenty and twenty elections focusing on this i also think like it's not an either or but it just seems institutionally to be an imperative that we get an answer to this we can't just be like you know what sire we don't care
care about looking into whether the russians like through the election we're we're not interested in whether the president obstructing justice we're just going to like caught her eyes this chapter and pretend that it didn't happen that's just that just seems like a deep error and we know how in this is from watergate
also democrats i mean i guess
what do you mean you mean like elected officials are just democrats in general what him in one in because because nancy pelosi and chuck schumer actually go and talk about this that much writer
i think i mean you on adam schiff and mark warner
i mean like i like i want us in the media
well we guns that are not discussing it and but here's the thing no think of it don't make all that he isn't enjoying slow burn and like the president and and and the chairman of a committee and congress going after the f b i is that's a that's an objectively big deal that's not about politics that's about
separation of powers and a boat as you were making the case last week about your rhino an independent institution right it's more me is speaking as a somebody who who wishes that republican congress ill and out of office and wishes this president out of office
also there is big the rabbit hole part of it is like serious i mean you have to concentrate really hard they're like new names to learn every week or remind yourself bob
wait this out a new piece of information and did i hear that six i was sure that i would never hear devon newness his name again i really wish sure he was somebody who i thought i've heard that learned this person's name back a year ago and i was like i don't need to know what i never knew to know this person's name again and now i know his damn name convention on the thing about marker although who
oh yeah you said trump official he was the spokesperson for legal to admit it
there before he left perhaps because he was concerned about obstruction wrangler had resigned i mean i think the reporting is that he resigned at a very strange moment and reporting has been that he resigned because of the handling of this memo about explaining this press release explaining what happened in them done junior meeting with some
the russian lawyer who is promising him dirt on hillary clinton he's a fascinating figure in this because he resigned in the moment
piers because he said something fishy happened and now the new york times is reporting that one of the things that was fishy is the whole pick said these emails will never showed the light of day i don't know what i mean was that obstruction or was that her just hoping something where it was true for some other reason but dumb great but something bad to mark corolla about
yeah to say that her picks says layer on her behalf denied that she ever made such a statement that's very very useful thank you that's right

president from delivered an exceptionally long state of the union address on tuesday night i'm must begin with a confession which is that i did not watch it i started to watch the dickerson in coverage on cbs i heard john i heard you say we're waiting for the house surgeon of armed and then i realized that literally anything i would do with an ex ninety minutes would be more edifying
fine and less distressing so i watched a black mirror episode instead
fuck me i'm great
okay really good yeah he really really good argument it's really good round but i mean a redneck things about the second season actually it's the fourth season but
currently yeah he's good
and season
in any case i did read the speech i read about the speech i watch some highlights i now understand that we're about to go to war with north korea and also emma thirteen that has been defeated that we are not going to spend one point five trillion dollars in infrastructure but somehow going to spend one point five trillion dollars in infrastructure and indicates john new
what do you thought that all americans are dreamers were all the dreamers i'm not really a dreamer so it didn't stick with me john how was the speech when there's a lot to there's a lead to unpack there's obvious
the theater review part which i'm
this is a president who thinks of things as a stage and so he used the format of the city union with dotted by these stories which presented his vision of america in which people end up the government were of the authors of their fate often in the trunk presidency because it comes to the president the messages and
it's a very blunt instrument and i thought in this case the speech itself showed some interesting political thoughts about how to use the speech to put democrats in in a box
by creating a picture of america and essentially saying to democrats why don't you come along with this issue this idea of america there was actually a lot of restraint in the speech the president didn't didn't talk about himself clearly he was they front loaded a lot of these stories to talk about other people to create this tableau why is that matter because it suggests that it
and an impulsive president who has been at war had one way or another with his own staff that has been raining these impulses got him at some level to trying to portray a picture of the presidency that during his actual presidency he hasn't bothered with much but in terms of actually extending an olive branch to
democrats by either accepting their view of the world in any small way to suggest that he was creating some political space for them to work with him he didn't do that he have you see when he said americans are dreamers to that was a direct shot at democrats and then we should obviously get to immigration which was the core policy part of the speech
but i've been talking too long but there was obviously a lot in the looks like the president has like not for an hour and twenty minute
finally every state of the union is too long it's forgettable and irrelevant is there anything reason to think this one will be relevant and remembered
wow i mean i think that divisiveness about immigration that kind of getting further from a deal on my taking them hard line on this that seems like it actually might matter i hate the state of the union i don't think i've lots to state of the union from more than like five or ten minutes in little pieces
his name be my whole life it's such a grab bag and i i'm allergic to this kind of political theater i don't like the standing up of people around the room then come to symbolize it just seems like using people to me i don't like the whole unlike anything about it to be fist just on the spectacle beaucoup
from the spectacle of it one is i simply do not understand through this every year why someone doesn't try a whole new format and just try to try to make a point in a totally different way shake it up
it's it's soul crushing not that it's soul crushing it's not a soul crushing other term it's it's just really boring and demoralizing
if you're if you're in the majority if you support the president it's it's like boring and you have moments to cheer about if you pose a president it's boring a new just irritating and frustrating but in for nobody is it actually enlightening or does it does it change people are energized people it doesn't energize people provide it sucks energy
away from people and so i i don't understand why somebody like trump who is such a master spectacle doesn't recognize i did i slightly disagree i think for republicans in that case i'm talking about not just the trump base i'm talking about the trump base plus the people who reluctantly supported them because they didn't like hillary clinton and those people who
i don't like him at all i think curing a president praise the military talk about the american flag talk about face
provide a public spectacle because that's what they say the union has become in support of those values in that picture of america i think is something that a lot of people who are republicans would find appealing
i don't think anyone really been of all democrats praise the military john that's a complete fallacies showing rape and so my point is that praising the military is different than praising it in the way that don't come to this was more now i shined that matter how many words and not along no absolutely and how we measure our like new
it's not it's not how we measure my point was just that there are a thought as ours and i think it's actually even beyond the trump days who would find something appealing in spending that much time on those things in in a presidential address
of course people will find that appealing and i'm sure if you install it and maybe cbs did this afterwards and you take a focus group that that there are people who are encouraged and heartened by it i just think you know this better than i do john if you look at historical polling data
the duration like does that indoor does that have meaning whole lasting significance to the change how people think or behave in the world no yeah there's no memorable for people you know nobody would make that claim i mean i just meant that dead when you saying that they're nobody would have liked it i don't i don't think that's true does it have any lasting significance i don't think it does i think it does tell
as something interesting about what is going on inside the white house a presidency dominated both in policy and spectacle government in which the president calls the tune about what is going to be going into congress and that's how it should go and congress is expected to do what he says
and then he is also the central spectacle in the american drama he is the ringmaster here at center stage even though his speech was obviously written and the whole tableau is written to create a notion of that america rather than i donald trump but in the symbolism you can't mistake that it's i donald trump which is also an aberration of the era
design are very representative government
that's very well said john i wonder that was the point i want to make read the pomp i think one of the thing that happens every year on the state of the union is that anchors like john dickerson perhaps i don't even know if you did this
this rhetoric that used about the symbolism the solemnity the the coming together that the peaceful coming together of all these branches of government you have a joint chiefs of staff you have supreme court
justices you have the cabinet you have the house and senate of both members from both parties in front of a public both physically present public and the galleries and then i obviously millions of people watching this
this magnificent solemnity that represents the glory of the institutions that i feel that that there's an element of poison has crept into it for just the region that you cite one other one other point just juxtaposition that i thought was really interesting was the state of union was the same day that there was this announcement that amazon and berkshire hathaway
and j p morgan chase are teaming up to try to remake healthcare they're trying to come up with a better model for health care and health care delivery so interesting and the reason they're doing that is because essentially the public sector has been hopeless that at public sector has failed or been these efforts but because there's simply no there's no agreement with
the public sector about what measures should be pursued and i just thought that the juxtaposition of a president standing up there and outline of course these grand ideas and in front of congress which is supposed to execute on these grand ideas and the contrast of the their shabby ability to do it first is that real problems that we face whether it's porto rico
whether it's inequality whether it's declines in life expectancy across the country whether it's that the failure of the healthcare system that is a pretty shabby and fad juxtaposition it is but if we feel like
partisan lock is unbreakable for all the reasons that we've talked about over the millions of years in in politics the idea that they at least one to try to do at work around is at least momentarily hopeful
that now i don't i'm sure there are all kinds of things i'm glad i'm glad yeah sure yeah oh i'm glad they're doing just that he can make them more likely to solve it but if that it's a sign of outline and have public sector oh absolutely no it's at i mean it's absolutely the case there is a nice column by dana milbank in the washington post which wax democrats for their
behavior during the state of the union
he says i should have and clapping my well that some of them didn't stand when the president enter the house chamber do you think it is ok for opposition politicians to behave this way i mean there were certainly
mega disapproval from liberals when joe wilson
yeah i'll do you lie at barack obama back in two thousand and nine or two thousand and ten indeed do you think the same the same applies to democrats who are who didn't yell you live but they certainly conveyed their distaste for the president on the one hand you are just talking about the danger of kind of lionized saying the president me off
yes to match in the way in the hall event creates that
rifkin that i would say reality and it's all geared toward that size does if that's your main concern then having people
in some small way or a large way exercise their right to distance themselves and make clear their lack of affinity for the president in both parties is fine it's like congress rabble rousing a little bad and using it's like nanosecond in front of the camera to try it
at present a different point of view
i know i'm not a big fan of these pomp and circumstance moments like i said from the beginning but once you're in one the just basic lake
politeness and fidelity doesn't seem to me like it has some worth and currency and i worry that because champ is such a device that figure this is an example i've had and just like bringing everyone down and that there is just like some basic civility that should reign in that chamber in public moment on i don't know
damn money and no i i i agree and
and i thought it was
bad on on those grounds and then just also in tactical grounds people are watching and see you not standing up when he talks about the national anthem a lot of people are going to realize that use think that this is a shot at you know come cavanagh and the players who are kneeling because of social justice concerns about america and
all of that all they see as a guy talking about in god we trust and national anthem and you're not standing and clapping you're looking furious and so it's just tactically it's a bad idea so why not just follows basic decorum ideas for this one min and moment of symbolism and then move on john end us with a brief
discussion on immigration
the president's policy goals as outlined in the speech and whether they will carry forth into legislation wow that president he outlined four pillars of his immigration plan
late in his back and forest for the president to be finally engaging and in the negotiations but anyway essentially what he offered was
this trade which is a lot of money for the border wall in exchange sure one point eight million undocumented immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a younger age that would have a pathway to citizenship then he would end of a lottery that's the third pillar and then ending what they call chain migration what others call family reunification
setting limits on that even the use of say that term chain migration if you are in earnest trying to put together a deal with democrats he just leave that expression out because you know what it does to irritate the other side and and so when the president's and also them when the president says americans are dreamers to your pitting democrats who who care about the dream
and basically you don't care about americans that's the subtext of that so and then when you talk about him as thirteen you you know you're sending a signal to democrats that i should say you know democrats will read that as you portraying all immigrants as murderers and the other subjects here is that the president ran and
add or the president's campaign committee ran an ad in which they said that the democrats were complicit in in killings by illegal immigrants
because they shut down the government so with all that mood music if you really wanted to get a deal done on immigration you wouldn't have done all of those things and so there's the policy but then there were also actual word choices and because this is a public argument over policy that were either not avoided or they were purposely chosen to irritate democrats there was no
nothing done in putting out those four pillars that's going to help solve the problem in the problem is that the president has concerned we target this last week and don't you to belabor it but he has conservatives who think that one point eight million dreamers are being given amnesty and will be furious that bad and then their democrats who aren't going to get any closer because he's he's up the price now for his wall it didn't doing
anything to actually make the situation better made it worse and he also had this little sleight of hand murray said we've been working with democrats and this is the bipartisan bill he presented his ideas as if they were the product a bipartisan negotiation which is why dick durbin was shaking his head and saying no violently while he was speaking so if this speech was an attempt to get a clue
closer to a deal i don't think it did that at all

hillary clinton found herself on the wrong side of me to this week after reports came out that she had overruled a recommendation back in two thousand and i met her presidential campaign fire it's faith advisor for harassing a woman who worked for him
the faith advisor who was named burns striker a name you could not make up if you tried was accused of delivering unwanted kittens and back massager sending and toward late night texts and generally behaving in a stock really manner when alerted to this to senior
campaign officials o'connell and then the campaign mentor petty fours doyle recommended that fire striker she this is
in to two thousand seven overruled them refined a woman to a good job elsewhere in the campaign duct starters pay and required him to go to camp for encountering never went to infect the kowtow to the story the appendix of the story that five years later working at another clinton affiliated organization a pack striker with fired
for sexually harassing other young women who worked for him
clinton at first weeks old when this story came out then a few minutes before the fate of the union she released a longer facebook statement thane she wouldn't do it the same way again that she had talk to the woman who had been a victim and that woman were satisfied with the disposition of it and that
her thinking of the time with the she hoped the punishment would change strikers behavior but it didn't and therefore it was it turned out to be the wrong choice
emily this prompted an outpouring of fury from women who have long supported her do you share that fury
yeah right i mean
so i guess i would start with saying that in the abstract i am in favor of an interim measures and punishments for people accused of sexual harassment i don't think everyone has to be fired and forever like drummed out of their profession i actually think that hearing about this kind of
measure it's like it's important that we figure out some in between punishments just as we need in between punishment in the criminal justice system
that fad there are two things that really very troubled me about this story one was clinton overriding the recommendations of the people who are investigating and supervising and the reason that bothered me so much as this is the kind of story that jeff like a few sentences
sentences we have and news coverage don't really get at it i think you have to like talk to the people involved and really understand the context deeply and why this woman fact i'm comfortable and how constant and it gave this guy his attentions of work to really understand and it sounds like both of the
women in the clinton
world who were investigating and supervising really got all of that context and then they made a decision and so the idea that hillary clinton wife of a kid sexual harasser i'm proud or clinton what if overrode those recommendations because she liked striker or whatever just seems like bad too
me the other thing that really bothered me was her facebook statement i think ruth marcus wrote a column kind of rewriting that statement to make it much more forthright and powerful the part that just drove me up the wall as when clinton said well i thought that the time this was the best solution
oh come on like you thought that this guy didn't weren't getting fired for your own reasons and claims not it's not fair and to hold her accountable in that moment of decision for the stuff he did five years later but it is also i just i just found that most of
that statement to be self serving and defensive in this way that this is the the weakness the kind of achilles heel of bill clinton as a politician and now that she's not running for office she doesn't there's there's no excuse for that kind of we easily language and that just like disappointment
i think i totally disagree with you about everything you just said let's go let's can time
why this is not it seems to me it seems to me that if striker had not really offended there would be no story at all well what about i mean
striker are not really what about the fact that she overrode the recommendations of patties all that oil and other that's what bosses do they make decisions based on more knowledge and
a grander sense and more life experience and that's why she was the the boston they weren't this is very analogous to you parole in in parole decisions all the time parole boards make decisions and there a parolees who reoffend right and when they re offend everyone like well why did they let this person out because they made of
they make bets and sometimes your bets are wrong and i think if if striker had not really offended that you would sit look back and say okay here's a case it was it was a fifty fifty she went one way and it look at this guy got his life together he he he got on antidepressants he restored and the marriage counseling you as opposed to
that is that he didn't go to the government and check to make sure no that was that was poor i think the that decision alone in a vacuum is a perfectly reasonable decision is a perfectly reasonable decision to have made in two thousand and seven and it's very weird to me to impose the standards of two thousand and eighteen
on the standards of two thousand and seven and to say that just because there were these recommendations that cheat you know she committed some shrimp fell act by doing this i think that was was she was engaging and subtlety and she was wrong because she picked the wrong guy
he didn't learn his lesson and he went on to to be a predator elsewhere and so she was wrong she she made a bad choice but i don't think that the choice was intrinsically
wrong at the time that wow i'm wrong in retrospect maybe but so two things i mean i just i do think that when bosses override the decision of the people like involved in the investigation they better have some really good reasons and i haven't heard any really good reasons and i don't think she wants to get it
into that but like that's not good i guess the other thing i would say is that given that the two women who are investigating are overseeing the investigation had a saw style and just o'connell came out the other way it does not seem as if by the standards of two thousand and seven firing this guy was like sa
extreme action to take mean they first thoughts that dozens of is not an anti delivery and period i mean i realize it's like before our current moment but they need the opposite call because that seemed like a reasonable decision to ban and so i think that suggests i don't know it's
also impossible for me to separate this judgment call at hillary clinton made from her relationship with her husband which is none of my business and many ways but does make one wonder whether she is not so good at preventing men from prowling as i think gal kind of thing
yeah i come down between the two view on this game time decision she made she could she could have just believed in forgiveness and redemption and that he was doing a good job and shouldn't be shouldn't get the maximum punishment if she believes it was going to stick but i think you know what you say family obviously has got to be a part of the curriculum
as well surely your own life experience with this must have played a role as a manager it's probably not great either to overrule to have your people sometimes when they make a call you have to trust and this is way truth president's because you can't do all the the speed work yourself you have to basically trust that you hired good enough people
values and you do all the investigative work here make a call and unless you really really really really really have a reason to do it you basically go with them
i just think emily for you
somebody who believes when it comes to the criminal justice system believes and mercy and and subtlety and in
the value of taking a risk that people are learned their lesson and been given a second chances to be so immediately condemned mentor if her giving a second chance to somebody who is far as we know at the time and maybe this will change this was a first offense of his and look the last person
who who needs who deserves a chance in the world the hands he gross middle aged white
i'm not gonna pretend yeah well as it heads triggered abstract principal keep going but i do think the fact that she came down on the side of mercy know maybe she came down on the side of mercy because it was purely opportunistic she didn't want to offend the faith community she thought this guy was doing good work for hearn did
want the the trauma that's entirely possible it's also possible she did because she thought this guy has he's screwed up he's having some messed up time and his family he's depressed and let's let's get him some help and and see if he can rehabilitate himself right so that is why i started out by saying that i think we need to find a place for and are on punishment someone
i first read about death if i was more sympathetic to that point of view and yeah the consequences for this person it seems in retrospect again like this is hard because you're right if you hadn't really offended then we wouldn't be clear about this and she didn't know that at the time and that's like important to kind of hang
onto but one thing i was thinking about is in our current moment we are relying on shaming a great deal right so you know one parallel that clinton kind of obliquely brought up in her facebook stay men with the new york times like interim punishment of gland thrash right near times mine blair i don't know gland but this i
you know you in suspense of mine take him off the white house be but not fire ham and then there are obvious like charges of hypocrisy because the times had broken the story and i guess what i think it's really important element is that you know thrushes been publicly shamed and embarrassed and we're relying on that part of this to dissuade
made him from continuing to treat women like this and that was not part it all of the burn stride our story and in fact there wasn't really any follow up if he didn't go to counseling and sell it seems like the lesson he took from this was that he could get away with this now i don't think that you have to fire someone to show them that they can't get away
a with this but something went wrong and yes it's true that it's only in retrospect we see that but i really wonder what message was sent to have that was insufficient and whether you know the clintons decision as a boss is the main ingredient here for a kind of lacks this and i guess also
yes it's important to allow for a mercy and leniency in second chances but that doesn't mean that you know bosses shouldn't take strong action or not in a current we're not talking about someone going to jail or talking about whether someone should have like a very high ranking positioned sensitive position and that's like a different calculus
yeah i certainly think the if you want to call hillary clinton to account new color to count one for not following up to ensure that counseling was done to for continuing to keep striker
very much in her orbit until very recently until the present essentially if she knew that he really offended in two thousand and thirteen and then still inviting him to her parties and still hanging out with him then she deserves more stick for that them i mean what if she didn't know because no one thought she would care man i don't know that seems weird to he was working on of her pack
either way it seems problematic

and like having drinks with the fish advisor
tree county congressman from south carolina republican and and he's not going to rerun and there's going to run again for congress and what the fuck wrong with him he's been sick of washington for a while so this is not he said something about the returning to the judicial system he was russia henderson judge great
anyway he was elected in in in two thousand and ten in south carolina and is basically gotten sick of congress in washington he is not the only republican in that position
a little little less than forty republicans who are retiring
now some in that number are running for other republican offices but that's a huge number of the other really big number is the nine committee chairman in the house who are retiring this week also brought the news the chairman rodney freely highs and is retiring he is one of the appropriations committee chairman
and there are people that spend entire careers just trying to be on the appropriations committee and so you now have these people who for all kinds of reason should stay in congress butter now choosing not to stay it's kind of extraordinary what's happening
before we even get to the actual election time
can i pause on targeted for one second to i know it's which means your best friend know i know i knew him slightly many many years ago and i found him delightful haven't talked to him and fifteen years but so trade gowdy one that's yeah bob inglis bob inglis
i remember this because you and i recover but bobbing list was notoriously incredibly conservative he was one of the gingrich revolutionaries he was he was the icon of conservatism really really right wing by the standards of the nineties and doubt he beat him in two thousand and ten by say same essentially that english with saw
often was no wonder conservative that and inglis was a moderate know you have god he himself has become get he had no one would call him a moderate go to you as somebody who people treat as is a reasonable republican people on the left will say well he said you know he's a very thoughtful person and
just to signal of i guess how far right party and we have to say something else about bob english switches that last summer
the growth are bad for the washington times about how it's that ten minutes i helped draft clinton's impeachment articles the charges against trump are more serious yeah he's been on a that
iran as long as he's been on

members of the parties you to actually like debate each other a lot in campaigns instead of just rushing off and telling their bases what they want to ear and that was it but two of them read a senior center together and english was very balanced budgets
reno restrain the growth of entitlements kind of candidate and so he went on and on about the demographic boom that was going to cripple the budget and this again
at a time where republicans all were running as deficit hawks counter to the behavior in the most recent tax cut hollings as a purveyor of pork i remember the headline of our story at the time has parks on the gretel was was ruining our fiscal future and he gets done with this long
wind up much like the one i'm on right now
and hollings just goes monkey talk that was her rebuttal
