on this week's gap as doctor glossy and mr cavanaugh the extraordinary spectacle and chaos surrounding the supreme court justice nomination will he and his accuser testify on monday will they not what are the politics of this really interesting story then president trump moves to declassify various materials related to the
russia investigation into the f b i handling of it
why our national security folks so outraged by this or are they they justifiably outraged by it then police shootings david french has a an interesting take on how to understand them and a change in how he's been thinking about them and we will talk about that emily always has good thoughts on this as well plus will have cocktail chatter and
for we had started just a quick announcement we will as you know be in austin texas next week on saturday september twenty ninth at the capitol factory as part of the texas tribune festival there will be slate day a day long

before a fad a and you can see me interview eric holder our former attorney general while and about mm and that are called are going to be fun exciting make a weekend of it yeah
go to texas to be interest for which is fantastic as we tape on thursday morning the cabin on nomination is in a fog
the sexual assault allegation term christine policy ford has prompted a delay and the judiciary committee boat as we're talking the committee has proposed that ford and cavanaugh come in as asked both of them to come in on monday
to testify before the committee
just them individually no other witnesses no other investigation ford meanwhile has asked apparently through her lawyer that no hearing be held or no testimony be taken until after an f b i investigations conducted into her allegations as i understand that the committee has given for a deadline of friday at ten am
to decide whether she's going to testify on monday
there's just so much going on in this story and it's so complicated
but emily when they start with a simple question which is if there is no investigation should doctor policy for testify on monday wow so first of all i think the classroom and investigation is a completely reasonable line and make sense if you're trying to actually ascertain the truth of these accusations stats
investigators do they look and surrounding circumstances and look for corroborating evidence this accusation is about something that took place thirty six years ago and it's possible that people aren't going to remember whether this party happened when it was etc but at least one would want to allow investigators a chance to try to sort that out
you know especially because cavanaugh said that he wasn't at any up at this party and that seems like something that it's possible to at least find out more about so i understand why a doctor but as he is asking for the investigation i think that if the republicans are going to refuse to do it which seems to clearly be their position then none of that
you know republican senators who asked for the hearing meaning flake and corcoran condom murkowski none of them are demanding and investigation and so i think the republicans have decided that the politics don't force them to do one and in that case i think that if doctor but as he wants to
try to have an effect on this confirmation then she has to testify on monday
whether she decided to do that or not that's her personal decisions i'm not going to tell her to do it but i think that sort of how the politics have landed at the moment david french do you think this merits of fbi investigation before any timid judiciary committee tests and or do you think that the testimony should go ahead with the two of them
now i don't think it merits and f b i investigation let's let's be clear about what we're talking about here we're talking about investigating what would have been a violation of state criminal law more than thirty years ago
something that the f b i doesn't investigate now to sing though when we're talking about investigation people keep ask acting as if the f b i is the only entity
that can investigate the senate committee itself can investigate the senate committee staff must both majority staff and minority staff can investigate a person who has been a a lawyer on the plane of side and have been a lie on the defendant side in a variety of kinds of cases in my career including some really tough in really tough sex
rasmussen type cases and a plaintiff can investigate a plaintiff's attorney can investigate and so there are a lot there are many different avenues of investigation here and so i think one thing i think is pretty clear and from what i'm hearing is it's not i do not believe that republican senators are sitting there
going i can't wait for her to testify in front of us so that we can destroy her on national television i think it's i think these republican senators many of them view her testifying on national television is an extremely high risk endeavor for the nominee
and for the g o p
i think that there is a is you that if she comes and she testifies in public and she's very compelling that this could absolutely sink the nomination but at the same time they also know you cannot possibly vote on this nominee without offering this testimony and so i think that they're going to continue
the offer up right up until the deadline and at the same time you would hope that these committee staffs are busy doing their jobs investigating this all the while so david maybe i'm a little confused about your position because a couple weeks ago you were saying that you know if there were only four four bars there were the other two let's hear from them
when in fact investigator shit interview everyone else at the party so are you saying that the f b i should not investigate by somebody showed or that hearing shouldn't just go ahead on monday on without any investigation no i'm saying and investigation should be conducted by the relevant committee and so the problem is if you're gonna say
hey there should be an investigation and only the f b i should investigate when this is not in the eyes standard operating procedure and think that's a problem that it is absolutely within the purview of these committees to do these kinds of investigations and from what i understand at least the majority staff has been doing these
instigation has talked to cavanaugh under penalty a felony has received correspondence from at least two of the other people who are allegedly at the parties say don't remember a party like this
so there is something going on behind the scenes that is not highly visible to us and the f b i typically doesn't investigate allege violations of state laws but in this context the f b i had does background checks of every supreme court nominee and did investigate and need to hell's allegations about
lance thomas in fact according to the lane as at the time said they were unfounded i mean i'm a little confused if cavanaugh is innocent i would think he would welcome investigation to clear his name so that part of it puzzles me but i also think from lousy for point of view the republican majority on saturday
judiciary committee is not a neutral source of investigation right i mean some of those centers have already said they believe cabinet and so i think what she is asking for here is to have some neutral fact finders but you also have the minority staff and powered investigate as well so that those are both part parties an entity is
the majority and minority parts of the committee and one lousy far is asking far as a neutral investigator and that seems to me to be different from just saying oh a particular entity the f b i am
i mean this is a slightly different point but i'm sleep i sort of your like he has not been
the this is the senate has the senate is the body carrying out this hearing the senate is holding a hearing to decide whether they want to confirm him for the supreme court this isn't a criminal investigation this is not an attempt to open a criminal investigation against him
is
process designed to decide on confirmation and i feel like if the senate rules as set by the majority of senators are like you know here's how we're going to do it even if they're tinge was partisan bias like it's why not just go ahead with this she can make a point as she testifies here's why this is an inadequate investor
location and here's what should be looked into but i don't know that that necessarily that she necessarily is entitled to this kind of investigation well i'm not delight and tied on the nonsense means and i i feel like i'm repeating myself but if you really want to try to find out the facts here as david french road a week or two ago you would investigate and
idea of having a neutral investigative body that more people might trust their findings seems totally sensible to me i mean the already have a situation in which people are lining up on one side of believe ham or believe her with a lot of partisan bias and forming their choices about that matter so if there are some hope here
of finding out other facts that could help people see this in a more neutral way galaxy important to me one other related question i have about this is the decision to only call to witnesses when there's a third person market judge who according to plan for it was in the room and then also is someone who suck
ports cavanaugh his version of events i mean it just seems to me that not to call him our judge has everything to do with marked i just character and the fact that he wrote a memoir or maybe even two memoirs about his alcoholism and black out drinking and if they call mark dogs they're going to say to him hey there was a character in your buck who you called bartow cavanaugh
you you know talked about peaking and passing out from alcohol is that back cavanaugh they'll the republicans don't want that guy you know testifying in front of the american people but again if you were really trying to ascertain the truth here and try to figure out who's credible and whose stories hold up of course you would call that third person
anyone else you could find who was supposed to be at that party david why do you think david french why do you think
mark judge and particular shouldn't be called on wonder if you do think that i don't think that i think that if you can identify people who were allegedly at the party they should be called and they should they should testify
so you know i look at this i look at this and in a way that is very similar to the process of civil litigation this because there's there's no prospect of prosecuting a crime here
that's that ship has sailed a long time ago
in in the process of civil civil litigation
a person comes forward with an accusation and then there's a burden of proof and this is the burden of proof i articulated in an article when all this just first broke on sunday was the lowest burden of proof possible and court and that is preponderance the advocates are more likely than not because i don't want to have a supreme court justice
sitting on the supreme court if it is more likely than not that they committed this this heinous of the sexual assault even when they were a teenager i if it's more likely than not that they did this i don't want them on the supreme court in the same way with roy more i was utterly opposed to this election in alabama because i thought it was more likely than not that he
had abused under age young teenagers when he was a prosecutor in alabama the same worries and i don't want i did not want trump in wealth for many reasons i did not want trump in the white house one is i thought it's more likely than not he was the sexual abuse or the same for bill clinton
that's the standard which i think is a fair standard as that we don't want someone in that office when it's more likely than not that they did this well then how do you go about establishing that i tend to believe that the accuser the person who comes forward with the accusation bears the burden of proving at least that it's more likely than not they did it
occurred in one thing that troubles me is as of right now
the only people who have said anything under it's not precisely penalty of perjury it's more precise he said sort of penalty a felony the only people who said anything under penalty of felony so far about this or cavanaugh and to the other people who are allegedly at the party and the accuser to this moment
still not said anything under oath or under any penalty a felony in a court of law that accusation would be tossed out unless the person was willing to state their case
under penalty of perjury and so the staff should investigate the heck out of this thing between now and hearing and then they should call relevant witnesses and if the majority doesn't want to call relevant witnesses
then i'd say shame on them but that is what we we we require of people all over this country and very very difficult circumstances when they claim has made his to come in put their hand in the air swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth and then make their case subject to cross examination that's the way this works
do you think if we end up seems highly possible at the moment with simply the two of them testify and on monday and may maybe is david friend says there will be a background investigation so at least the senders will come armed with with material to ask questions about although it doesn't sound like there will be the other people under oath at the moment and
we have one person who makes a claim and she was credible and we have another person who denies that claim and he is credible what do we left with at that point if me and i'm gonna check because we haven't read the testimony and i agree with david french that it's entirely possible on i mean in my view likely that lousy for it is going
be a compelling and sympathetic teller of her story and that that could have a real impact but we have to wait and see how it plays out you know for me some of the arguments people have made about why a lousy for it doesn't seem credible to than are not arguments that hold up to me on and i
for example because one of the arguments i think david french you've made this argument that you know because she waited so long to come forward that suggests that on i mean certainly true of makes it harder to prove but to me doesn't at all make it clear that she's not telling the truth
caitlin flanagan did an amazing job on the daily this week for the new york times and in the atlantic talking about a sexual assault she experienced that she didn't tell anyone about i had to experience of sexual assault in high school in the eighties i didn't tell anyone
for a long time we just didn't do that i felt we too much shame and responsibility to talk about it just seemed like something that was my fault
but i know it happened to me
and i have the same response to hearing president chant and others suggest that maybe she's mixed up about cavanaugh his identity because i would never be mixed up about the person who did that to me so i find those efforts to undermine her story
really hard to listen to do you guys think that the
peripheral evidence about cap and o's teenage years has his own joking about what happens at georgetown props to the dirt can prep the hence in the mark judge memoir about cavanaugh do you think that's going to come up is it relevant to senators need to consider that
look i think whether or not he drink to excess on occasion in high school is
you know to to let let me put it this way if he said look there's no way i could have done this because i was stone cold sober all of the time and remember with clarity where i was in where you know what i did and then there was evidence no in fact you drank too much on occasion i mean at some point
it gets very very difficult to say evidence that he drank too much on occasion he calls evidence that he committed a serious act of sexual assault to mean you know
it's funny how all of this is when when you when you lack in one of the problems that we have here i think is when you lack a lot of evidence one way or the other we begin to fill in the void with our own experience in i think that's one of the reasons why some of the articles that
for example caitlin is article that you referenced earlier has been so so powerful for so many people because it resonates so much with their own experience and so in the absence of a whole lot of evidence to really sit there and way and carefully consider you begin to import your experience in these things and i think
that's just a very human thing that we all do but it's a thing that we do in the absence of evidence and when that occurs it ramps up what's already and intense and emotional high stakes high stakes kind of confirmation battle political battle and it becomes something else entirely it becomes a big call
neutral moment and we've seen this many many times and so no i don't say that there's a lack of corroborating evidence contemporaneous corroborating evidence means that she's lying i'm saying it more from a legal standpoint is that is a lack of additional evidence that is of consequence if you are going to be making this case in court
saying that that's where i'm going with that
making this into a cultural moment sounds like it's very machine and being propelled by a few individual anecdotal narratives so i want to bring enough and smart article by sandra new meaning courts about on though relative rarity of false rape accusations are just something that i've also written about
the low rate of people of women or anyone men to whoever who come in to police stations and report a rape falsely and we've known that for awhile but added to this picture which i thought was really valuable his bed when people do maze make false accusations they usually have a his
three of fraud or mental illness or something sometimes there's like a clear motivation of revenge something that allows the facts to unravel pretty quickly and shows that there is some external motivation behind the false claim and also usually the false claims are like really
the floor it there you know highly dramatic accounts of rape like the claim that you know the uva student made and the rolling stone peace but fell apart which we've talked a lot about on the show
people rarely and make claims of things that could be mistaken for consent and that's the kind of claimed lousy for it is making here so i think that's important set of not just a few anecdotal narratives but some day that to add to this picture that to me
no balance against this notion that blogs you for it isn't telling the truth
there's one there's one problem with those studies so the problem is our our legal system just not adjudicate for falsity so
what you what you end up having as a general rule whether a prosecutor if the jury equipped for example a defendant they don't adjudicate the claim to be false said that the burden of proof wasn't met if a if a prosecutor declines to proceed with the case or a judge grants a summary judgment
motion and a sexual harassment case a civil sexual assault case the there's not an adjudication of false news when it instance there's a a failure to meet or he believed failure to meet a burden of proof and so all of these studies that say well x percent or false
and there's a methodological problem there because that's not what our system adjudicate for and so you can have a situation in this happens all the time were a person isn't a false accuser
in other words are not deliberately making a false claim but they're making a claim that is insufficient to meet the burden of proof sometimes for reasons due to their own memories sometimes for reasons due to conflicting evidence sometimes for many reasons and so i think it's
i don't think outside of the some of the fever swamps on the right i haven't seen too many people sitting here saying that doctor ford is it maliciously sitting back there and making all this up
what i'm seeing is more people saying that based on the totality the evidence it appears that she might be mistaken about one or more elements so you are talking before about a situation of proving grape beyond a reasonable doubt and it is absolutely true that rape is a famously hard charged approve but the notion that
then one moved from there to the idea that there is some large number of false rape accusations out there we just don't have any evidence for that it just like canard and when you say that you think that lousy for dismissed could be mistaken that's a very delicate way of putting it though what do you think she is mistaken about she could be mistake
and about identity of the attacker she could be mistaken about the exact circumstances of the things that happened in the room she could be mistaken about the amount of alcohol that various people including yourself consumed when you're talking about one of the things that's really interesting about memory
is that in this is a hard truth for people to understand because nobody doubts their own memory
if you say to somebody the thing that you remember is one of the most important things of your in your life you could be remembering incorrectly people get really upset about that and they said vicious not possible
better everything that we know about memory says not only is that not only is it possible that is frequently the case frequently now it's not doesn't mean that this thirty year old memory that i have seared in my mind is false it's just that i can't be sure that this thirty year old memory that is seared in my mind is true when as a young lawyer i used to
this is you have the law so naive that was here's one side that's telling the truth and here's one side that's telling a lie and i always want to be on the side that's telling the truth
when i began to see his on these really really important things in people's lives i would see people believing with their whole heart that their story was right and then sometimes reacting with extreme shock when confronted with contrary evidence and so there
is actually a really interesting malcolm glad well pod cast recently revisionist history that sort of use the brian williams controversy to tee off on some of these aspects of our memories and so that's why when people say we need corroboration we need corroboration you're not saying you lie or you liar you're saying these things things
things get hazy in our minds play tricks on us and the more that we can have that can give us assurance that this thirty year old memory is accurate the better off we'll be we're very close there's a article this morning and the times by richard feynman is a psychiatrist about memory and he is pointing out
in a way that i think has a very different emphasis then your rendition david french that when people experience intense emotion that back and actually make memories more powerful and lasting and one of the really important distinctions that freedom is making here is between are covered mammary where someone you know
a memory completely goes away and then supposedly returns there's a lot of reason to doubt situations like that and a memory that's there all along that someone has tried to pass but can't get rid of which is very much what happened to lousy ford what happened to me that's what happened caitlin flanagan you can dismiss bad as a few anecdote as you want but i think they're a lot of other
people out there who have experienced sexual assault a lot of women who are in that category and to me all of those things not to mention the culture of silence of the eighties ways much more heavily than the kind of doubt that you are trying to sell here though i realized that you know for republicans it's really useful to try to sell that kind of doubt right
now

under girding the carter pay page five application the text messages of former justice department f b i officials who criticized
including f b i director games komi former deputy director andrew mackay lisa page the lawyer f b i agent peter struck former agent peter struck and also a material for the former justice
if the former justice department official birth or i thought he was he's current current he's still there
an extraordinary that i'm happy yes
so it's clear that the president has the the right to order the classification of anything he wants
so david brent what if anything is problematic about him ordering a the classification of these materials maybe nothing as well so there's a couple ways to think about this one is
mr believe having seen an awful lot of classified information in my life that we have a massive over classification problem
here in this country
we classify way way too much information i mean he would almost laugh out loud
i was in iraq i had my super net computer and and my cypriot we you know it's a secret system and i would look at all of the the information flowing through the super net and i'm just like only about ten percent of this really needs to be classified so i default as a general matter towards more trains
guarantee especially on the matter like this that were conspiracy theories are just ripping apart our body politic however however to say that i'm against over classification does not mean that we need to have total transparency because the fact of the matter is some stuff still does need to be class
certified in i frankly i don't trust donald trump to make that distinction
nor do i necessarily have a greater degree of confidence suddenly very authorities that are responsible for over over classification problem to draw the boundaries either so i feel like we're at a bit of an impasse but my general default is towards greater transparency rather than less
it would be slightly more persuasive if it wasn't so obviously designed to benefit him if he pick things that weren't so obviously about the thing for he has been making noise around him at her personally related to him and he's that he is obsessed with the fact that he continues to use the justice department or use the justice system as his own personal
all vindication of his own personal legal troubles is what to me as problematic emily do you feel like there's any defense for what tramples trying to do you really think of it i mean it's true that over classification is a huge problem it's true that deciding and this incredibly selective way to release the materials that you know
mark meadows and other people who have been excoriating and castigating the mall or investigation and the justice department for a month practically years at this point on that is just a very specific an overly specific part is in biased way of addressing the of reclassification problem mean i just think they'd want me to do with each other
on and i've been struck by the response of a lot of or justice department officials that this kind of order like there's no precedent for it in an ongoing investigation i also wonder if it's really not gonna help trunk in the end i mean every time these you know incredibly part is and republicans have tried to make some
case of bias on having to do with the face application for carter paid for example just part of what we're talking about here they've just been proven wrong when documents have been released i think it's useful to try to try to get that tax between pete struck and lisa page you know from the f b i and the just apartment back in the news because
cause even though i think that's a lot of smoke there and there was a whole investigation and yes they were biased against but the findings by the inspector general at the justice department where that had no bearing on the investigation despite those important central facts i'm just having these kind of bad sounding tax out there is like a way of turning up a lot
of chaff that than confuses people and it's like a good sort of love obfuscation are just like smoke for time to hide behind and that seems to me to be like the only real utility hear that and just railing against the justice department in trying to undermine you know the people who are protecting them all our investigation right i think your chat
point is right on i'm a way which is that even if there is less in these documents and current pope theories in terms of indicating hammer suggesting a partisan bias and investigation and against him it creates talking pouring to create things to mull over think it creates just distraction confusion and and undermine and also
oh it fulfills what i perceive to be one of the implicit goals and the trump a president trump same a trip administration which is to undermine certain institutions of government because he perceived those institutions to be a threat to him personally and that to me is what of so unsettling about all of this the weakening of institutions which we
as americans should want to be pretty strong david friend she said this week that we don't have an attorney general the present term conclusion a remarkable attack on his own attorney general know i have certainly have no deep fondness for jeff sessions and attorney general illness find him to be engaging in matters policy will i find appalling but what did you make of that
as as
conversation for him to start
our time
the to asian of a battering that jeff sessions and the dating or months
i disagree with sessions on the number of things civil asset forfeiture some of its approaches on the word drugs some of this purchase on prison reform i mean i could go down a list there are also things he does that i like but i think at least thus far
trump administration i think history will judge jeff sessions as being a pretty courageous guy in the face of some pretty intense pressure from the president states to distort the wheels of justice and and so you know each time the president says this and each time the president pitch when these temper tantrums my
initiation for session standing firm and rosenstein saying standing firm increases and you know look i do think on that he to give people a little bit of background on the d classification issue there there's another reason why
net net i'm for greater the classification of the quarter page pfizer applications
and part of that is i think that there's a lot of people who are making a faith based assertion about the carter page pfizer applications that i do not believe will be warranted by the facts based on everything i know about the pfizer process and people that i've talked to off the record who have been at least
what connected to this process
and that is the faith based assertion you see on the right there sort of this unified conspiracy theory that exists and the unified conspiracy theory goes something like this that the entire russia controversy all of it truly boils down to the use of the steel dossier they got
this this shoddy dossier they used to corrupt f b i and everything and this is the fruit of the poisonous tree is all of this flows from the or page pfizer and what is interesting to me
is that assertion is often made most definitively by people who have not seen the document
and so i actually i believe two things at once i believe most of the reactions of the car to page pfizer are not actually you can remove them and not harm national security and the other thing i believe is that i also do not believe that these fights applications
when they're seen and when they're in context and that's going to be key is this just going to be a super targeted reaction that only redux information helpful for the trunk
side of the argument or not that in when read and context
i don't believe they will provide the support that people believe that they will regarding this sort of the unified conspiracy theory and you know once again you have to go back to these these fights applications where new time and time again by different g o p appointed judges and all of these people who say well these these fires applications were material
misleading materially misleading forget that the judges have the ability to go back to the d o j and ask for additional information and to sanction the d o j d o j if they believe the d o j was materially misleading suit every david i mean i have a question about that if that's the case then why with president trump be so eager to get more of it out the
would think that than the ambiguity who doubt about what's in them and the fact that people haven't seen them would serve him why would he wanted to why would you then want everything exposed where if you say what you say is true it's going to reveal that in in totality is actually doesn't that make his case at all i think the answer lies in some comments that he
made recently after the classification order and that he says that he made the classification order after hearing from sean hannity judge janine
and i can't really dogs don't leave out of it and lou dobbs and lou dobbs so the idea i think that the idea that trump i sitting there at the resolute desk remedy you adviser at like like
having a teaser confirmed as they did exactly that he really unify the ah clouds it yes yeah the idea that hey sat there and sort of like this saturday the remember the old saturday night live sketch about ronald reagan that raised looks bumbling when say the boy scouts or how america when yeah then that trump when he's he's reality tv star by
day and then by nineties behind the resolute desk pouring through classified documents i just i think he's operating under the same faith based determination and one of the reasons why he has his impulse to declassify has been for did for so long and said other people and his orbit who are not operating under that faith based determination are saying are you sure you wanted
you that mr president are you sure you want to do that and sean hannity we finally convinced him that he sure i'm in the veil and that is the concern about burning intelligence sources i mean this president has been careless and that in the past we have evidence ad and so the tricky part for the justice
part and you know in responding david to what you're saying about how a lot of death doesn't need to be redacted there isn't a national security interests bear i mean you may be right about that i have no idea but i do have to take seriously that potential problem and exposing on intelligence sources or methods and an ongoing and best
and and you know maybe you'll be proven right and these documents will be released and will see that the justice department didn't have a national security interest in protecting the classified nature of these documents but you can certainly see why trumps lack of concern for that would give people pause and internally
just someone who weird little more feel like
we all live with been would have since world now which is mean by that which is you know that now that there's there's a president who is playing so fast and loose with intelligence and how the intelligence or more per attack and pretend that i n enroll david david french's and initial point which is that we are live in this world of massive over classification remains
and it's you
i don't want to be put on the side of than saying okay let's let's declassify everything that any any intelligence agency wants to keep classified because they're not betray want your guess i mean i think you could certainly promote a culture of great er the classification and i could be all for it at having more stringent standards but to have this incredibly selective you know
self interested even if deluded order like that this just isn't that one final point about those actually question for you guys is so the president ordered it but it hasn't happened right i know i was sent home with that
i don't matter just like when it will it happen will have to see and also unlikely actually that they actually engage in a review process which i don't know if the president orders that was their review process what's the deal their david french shouldn't they just shouldn't we all be downloading copies of this on on our i phones right now
well you know the race a really good question
remember trump has issued some pretty emphatic declarations in the past that if not come to pass for example you know he he should the string of tweets about trains and or soldiers in the military and where where exactly that that policy was about a slow walk as you can possibly imagine
my understanding is essentially the positions been taken now is that his order triggered a process it didn't end the process
and one of the things that you see
frequently in this administration is there is a gap between trumps words even seemingly trumps emphatic orders and the actual actions that take place and so i'm going to wait on the d classification assessment until i see the final result here the ultimate the classification assessment
until i see the final result here but to the sources and methods point so i think at some point if he pushes this to the point that truly jeopardizes national security that truly jeopardizes the lives of say a source or truly japanese jeopardize it's a method that is vital to american national security protect
he literally vital to our surveillance of russia our primary geo political rival that's when it tips into serious people and b o j saying mr president i respect for i respectfully resign rather than carry out your order we have not seen that kind of thing happened yet but i think that that would be a tipping point we haven't seen that safeguard
click and quite yet
i know for a fact it's been considered on certain occasions but we haven't seen that safeguard get clicked and and i think that safeguard should click and if he is truly endangering sources and methods but one of the things that makes me a little skeptical about some of the classification battle here
as you remember the the infamous nunez memo several months ago which feels like in the in the hang of a bad break that yelled headache yeah yes mean that's probably just a few months ago feels like it was twenty five years ago it is just a few months ago but still hang of it yes
there was a lot of anguish over the fact that the nunez memo was going to be declassified and then it was declassified and you reddit new thought what in there was worthy of classification this is just a very poorly written memo containing information that we basically already knew but the the anguish over the class
location people telling us this was going to cause national security problems and then it comes out in it and it lands except in sort of again conspiracy theory twitter
with a third i am skeptical even in this context of the muller investigation and all of this of claims about national security and sources and methods in part because all of the mistaken anguish over the nunez memo there should have been anguish over it because as a cruddy memo
but not because it was endangering american national security every i hear devon and his name or remember the first time i heard it and i thought i'd never want to hear this guy's name again
somebody who's given nunez to me and bodies the kind of person who
just isn't is an embarrassment to the republic is terrible and his job he's a disgrace and you just want him to vanish and yet he keep and yet reality the heat but he keeps mushrooming crap and he he has to me a symbol of all that is all that have screwed up in america and i want him i always want him to vanish

why i changed the way i write about police shootings
the peace that david brent wrote for national review it raced around liberal twitter liberal twitter loves it when somebody who is on the other side takes on one of their positions or at least seems vaguely sympathetic to part of their positions and you know david you have written really interestingly from a lot of different perspectives
police shootings about qualified immunity for government officials notably for cops
and so let's have a conversation about the state of of police shootings in the state of how we think about police shootings and maybe we'll start with another piece that you wrote right before that about the worst police shooting that we've had yet which is the amber geiger shooting of both i'm sure john
a neighbor of hers a hamburger as a police officer in texas who barged into the apartment
a neighbor
at night and shot him
essentially unprovoked and she thought she was enter into her apartment know
she what she said it we say what was sitting on it attempt it's a crazy story the idea that it's considered a police shooting as ludicrous she's a she's a civilian she was acting civilian neighborly way and went and shot somebody in a different apartment but anyway we can talk about that and she's game charged with manslaughter it's that happened yet
she's charge as of right now but the grand jury has not yet weight in i would act grand jury to ultimately go with murder i would expect but it wouldn't shock me if it stayed manslaughter but i think murder is the correct charger and reasons i explain to my keys are david
first of all is that a police shooting this is a woman who is not he wasn't carrying out her duties she wasn't carrying out her job duties the time and and then talk a little bit about why you why you feel you're thinking or writing about this in different ways to their yeah i'm going to say yes and no to the police shooting yes in in the sense that i honest
if the story as being told if the story that's being told right now is the story and i do not believe that there there is inconsistent evidence right now that contradicts the officer story
that we can get into but if let's just presumed for the moment that the officer story is correct
i think that her identity as an officer was was important to her to the decision to pull the trigger and this is what i mean she walks in off duty she's armed and and winning a cop is in in their uniform most cops i know still view themselves as being closed with the authority of the state she goes into place that she
he believes as her own apartment and we can talk about that all day how that's not very credible delicious say that it is there's a person in there and this was this really an important element of this that she was using as a defense that he would not obey her commands and when he did not obey her commands she shot him
so in that standpoint what she's trying to do quite obviously in this account is to close herself with the authority of the police officer responding to an uncertain dangerous ambiguous situation that's what she's trying to do with her account so that's why in the one hand i say yeah police shooting because that's true
what she's trying to do but the reality as as you as you said it's not a legally speaking it is actually not a police shooting because the instant that she went to the wrong door
and the instant that she brandished her weapon in another man's apartment she was not close with the authority of the state at all at that point she is functionally and armed home invader and the person who is in reality close close with authority by the state he was he had the authority
at that point he could have defended himself a deadly force she was a criminal at that point so in that same point no it's not right to call it a police shooting and that's one of the things that i think is so that was so disturbing it was so disturbing on count number one that she is attempting to fit this into the box of her
of her authorities and officer and then number two it appeared that she received some pretty substantial treatment special treatment that you or i or any of the three of us would not receive if we walked to the wrong door and shot dead man and his own home
she walked away from the scene apparently without being arrested it took several days to arrest her she was charged with a crime
several magnitude order of magnitude less severe than what you and i would be charged with and attempting to benefit both prior to the shooting and and after the shooting from her status as a police officer and i thought that was outrageous to david you point out the police should shoot and kill about one thousand people a year in this country
for thirty seven hundred since january two thousand and fifteen
five to nine percent of those people are on armed
that number has gone up and down a little bits here and there it doesn't appear that black man
our been shot and killed disproportionately
they have been killed proportional to their share of the population but not perhaps their share of the population potential criminals or violent criminals
but they just want a fan like i find that pass and really proud attic as a starting place no and yes because it assumes that all black men are violent criminals and therefore the subject
more vulnerable because of their own behavior which is just absolutely not true and it's also true that cities where there more violence
does do are not the same cities by them are police shooting so and all that i just said comes from wesley lowery in general do and also the other point being that black men in general are wildly disproportionately subject to other forms of police mistreatment or or police use of exceptional for so peppers
pray for example even if even if they're not shot and killed it rates so what what in those days are what in that suggested to you that you were thinking about police shootings
cock eyed way yes a couple of things one is if you go back to sort as the inception of the modern form of this debate because we were fooling ourselves if we say that this debate just got really rolling two thousand and fourteen thousand and fifteen
but if you go back to the inception of the debate
and you were trying to look and figure out how big of a problem did we have a police shootings we really had huge gaps in our data just huge gaps and so what we what was happening is that we were extrapolating an awful lot from anecdotes and so you would have you know that my
brown shooting say in ferguson or they eric garner shooting and you would have these individual you know something there
it wasn't shot with letters at a choking the choking guess yeah
and so you'd have these individual incidents and then we didn't have a huge amount of data so then what would happen is you would look at these incidents were almost like a proxy for the whole debate
so you know when the hands up don't shoot when you know even the the holder d o j couldn't substantiate the hands up don't shoot
that see that debunking achieved first and partisan reasons and also said for some reasons good faith reasons
outsized important then news organizations notably among them the washington post said wait a minute
all this data we have about police shootings
is just wrong
it's way in complete so we're going to try to be more complete as they began to try to be more complete and applying real methodological rigor the number of police shootings skyrocketed like the number of actual shootings went way up and that wasn't in the post it and keep count of all the wounded so you know there's wounding for
every shooting so that number expanded dramatically than another thing began to happen and that is we began to seem more video of the actual shootings
and as i looked at the video of the actual shootings i was filtering that that through a prism of my own experience and i have experience serving in iraq during the surge with the third armor cavalry regiment and i have experienced not as much as an infantry soldier of course or an armor officer of course because i was a jagged officer but i was a jagged awesome
was outside the wire a lot on foot patrols
i'm in convoys in tribal relations in meetings in meetings in situations that were a hundred times more dangerous than any given day in any city in the united states and i saw that the soldiers i served with exercise greater fire discipline
and a far more dangerous circumstance than some of the police i was watching an american cities
and that was deeply disturbing to me so you have a couple of things going on at the same time you have number one the number of shootings is far more than many people believed and number two the circumstances of shooting after shooting from my eyes looked more suspect
what looks suspect even under in a war zone even in a war zone compared to being an american city and and there was a shooting i looked at in sacramento
where an unarmed man was gunned down within sec i mean within seconds after the police believe they spotted a gun when he actually had a believer cell phone
and all of these people were saying well the police were fine because they thought the cell phone was a gun and said no whoa whoa wait a minute i know that for example soldiers take into consideration the back ground level of risk and are trained to take into consideration the back ground level of risk before they pull the trigger
well so for example in sacramento i did the research and i found that there was you know maybe one a shooting of a police officer say about every fifteen to twenty years
that's not a circumstance and says i opened fire within two seconds when i'm pursuing not a suspected armed robber but a suspected vandal and that combination of factors
led me to believe that whoa wait a minute the way that i had extrapolated and talked about this issue in the past was it's not that i said all police shootings were right or that all it and there was no such thing as races cops it was much more on the standpoint of to be sure there are some races
dropped by it and then debunking the larger problem if that makes sense and so now i realize that wait a minute
there is a larger problem
and here's why i believe there's a larger problem
one and i think they liked it at your p for the or recognition that while the justice department in dade the officer killed michael brown they did fine if history of deep history of discriminatory law and forest man in ferguson missouri where brand killed you know to me that is very relevant contact
and i assume from the way you what your piece that you're also thinking a new about those kinds of facts on the ground in the past i think you've been very critical of the black lives matter of men and you know i see that movement of coming out of their fans of a recognition of those racially and discriminatory facts in a lot of places
the country the black lives matter of men have in families evolved into being more challenge the democratic process right now and is in a number of ways i'm looking to influence politics and something that was hilarious been raining about lately and i wonder if your views of black lives matter i have changed along with your
thinking about what kind of context matters for evaluating police shootings
well it depends on what aspects so for example their formal black lives matter movement still seems to it doesn't seem to it actually does honor some of these convicted cop killers who are in cuba right now
it's still maintains one of its goals is to disrupt the western prescribe nuclear family those things i just i just never gonna i'm never going to agree with those things and and then you know some of some of the rallies turned violent that i'm not going to agree that that's
writer or a proper in in any of these contacts so so here is my my problem i think in the past as i would look at those things the the violent to incidents the more radical statements from the organization and then i would say i'm going to focus on those things that i disagree with right and i was in and i was not
going to focus on the other areas that i was over time began to grow more and more alarmed by so then about you know i don't know year and a half or so ago it flipped over to where my alarm about the things that i was seeing on the streets and things like the substance of the second d o j ferguson her
court and the elements of the study i mention in my piece about the much greater likelihood of non lethal force but still very substantial for being used against african americans that became more important to me to deal with than the excesses of black lives matter the formal movement so if we
i think we all believe that that
people there are too many police shootings and i think david your analysis that officers are over preceding risk and acting more with impunity because they feel themselves at risk even if they aren't at risk what are the the actual remedies are improvements that can be made i mean for for one question i have is should cops always carry guns do
police in this country have to carry a gun all the time if necessary adding that they're really good question it so hard to unmanned and then giving up their weapons at this point and because we're such a weapon i used culture and so many other people have guns
that makes it feel sort of and plausible that you know i think let me go back to death terrible shooting and now we're talking about earlier we see the real dangers of cops caught carrying weapons out the time
i imagine david france you have a different perspective honest and say no you're much more of a second amendment guide and i am oh yeah i mean i think cops are always going to carry guns i mean i live here in tennessee i have a concealed carry permit i typically carry a gun
the i think the issue though is in here's where guys can christian democratic questions or it because we don't have that many people with concealed carry permits so look who come on the show and
interesting to me
just can i just can we just linger for a couple of seconds with them question what has her how often do you think you what makes you decide whether you're going to carry that day i said default that i do unless i'm gonna go to a place where you know like the sound engineers like wait a minute this guy armed not for the record i doubt the
as a general know or feel that will carry permit it
well you don't want to be a little nervous and i don't want to wanted me to feel uncomfortable now i as a general my default as i do i don't when i know that i'm going to replace that is a gun free area so like a going to school or concerts things like that so that's my default is that i do i use to tonight i've always supported the right to
kerry by my family
some listeners may know i was pretty prominently in involved at least prominent by you know obscure pundit standards
and the never trump world
and we got a just an avalanche of vitriol and against our family and including some really really disturbing things that occurred and so i'm very keenly aware of the need to protect my family so that's my default
is that i do carry and how do you have clothes that are modified for to where are you don't mean if you want to say where you carry and know it's it's very easy as just a matter of of
which you know it's a matter of gun choice actually so it's very easy once you settle on the gun that you are most comfortable and accurate with you then adjust your clothing accordingly and it's super easy you see me and you would never ever ever in a million years suspect that i'm carrying a weapon so around here in the south you know like if you if i say that when i'm up in in our head
in new york
and i'm talking to just random fogs it's sort of they look at me like you might be a little dangerous and crazy
that around here it's just you know you're kind of surprised if somebody has never carried a weapon
my wife's friends carry my wife carries it's just the norm for an awful lot of people so it's not even a socially awkward thing at all
one more question for me on it so i carry a phone with me all the time and against my my will against my better judgment uncomfortable touching the phone turn you know on checking tumbling like when you're carrying your weapon how often do you just like touch it or cart like remaining engage with it and how often is it just sort of sitting
you don't even think about it a responsible gun owner is constantly cognizant of its position but is not fiddling with it
at all
so yeah yeah hear you're sitting there your cognizant of it but you're not manipulating it and that's just basic safety and so and when the interesting things about the concealed carry community
look at the statistics a remarkably law abiding our best indication is that the concealed carry him community is more law abiding the police
which can get her back to live in a and where you've been saying that not very impressive but ah well one of the reasons and this is i think really important distinction between the private citizen with a gun in the police officer with a gun and this is super important i think for people to understand i know that if i
fire my gyn and it isn't unreasonable use that weapon i'm going to prison
i know that if i fire my weapon and i negligently or recklessly harm another person i may not only go to prison but my family i may be bankrupted as i pay damages i know that now if you're a police officer
and you use your weapon in the line a deity unless it's like some sort of like cartel style execution as long as you can make a plausible see my semi semi plausible argument that you felt afraid then you're almost certainly going to be acquitted and then you're almost certainly going to have what's called qualify
immunity against damages so think about the difference there you have a concealed carried community that is absolutely subject to the law in a police community that is sadly and very important respects not subject to the law in the same way and i think that has a real negative
pat on the police use of force

max max and i visited paid
backlash
eight people of pennsylvania taxpayer dollars go on to cocktail chatter
when you you more about one in your post yom kippur
mad consumption of food and alcohol and booze in your your girl falling down drink after drink what are you going to be chattering about two things actually a of hurry and came and van again wrote this amazing fannie atlantic that we talked about earlier and dead and and interview on a daily with
hey really recommend and i bring it up particularly because they felt like she was articulating something about her own feelings about forgiveness there was related to what i was trying to say earlier in the week about second chances for people and why it matters more to me that if cat and i indeed committed the factual sell that he has never in any way
hey reckoned with it or on paid any debt for it so i just recommend that and in line with that when i was infinite god for young people are the rabbi read some text from my mom at ease that has to do with died my mother
for my motive thought you said
from my manatees i know text and lift in the modern the modern world have a different meaning i was just like imagine my mom he's texting
oh really
dammit an ending like you it yet
i mean i know i was actually do at the can't the concept of tissue it
judaism which is what we are striving for on yom kippur war and it's some combination of like a town meant and seeking forgiveness and also return anyway and my mind he said among the paths of repentance is for the penitent to change his name as if to say i am someone else and
no longer the person who did those acts i don't know if i exactly think that you can no longer be the person who did the bad acts but i think it's really important to allow room for the notion that people are not the worst thing that they dead and that one matters more is what they do or don't do to fix the worse thing made it and now i'm going to sneak
in another sort of hit chatter which is anti to recommend a piece in the washington post this week by elizabeth burn and about rape allegations that took place at the high school she went to in arlington texas there are allegations back from two thousand and six that ended in just total disaster for the teenage girl at the time
time who said she'd been raped enlisted that's just did an enormously sensitive and also on comprehensive job reporting out this story and trying to understand why these boys were never in dated even know there was quite a bit of physical evidence implicating man as well as and or why it the teenager story and
it's just such an important reminder at this moment of how many girls experience sexual assault and not only does
are not able to bring the by its to justice in the criminal justice system but themselves are turned on that is still a reality that is present for us and fails relevant to me this week
david what is your chowder
well let me let me echo the complements tool is but story it was an outstanding and moving piece of reporting and did show very very vividly the challenges particularly and in this is sad to say because we've seen it many many times are in this country when you make claims there's sort of this
category of person that people rally around in a vicious way and it's high school athletes
you may claims against high school athletes and it's remarkable what happens in that story can be replicated has been replicated around this country many times and that's evidence i think of a cultural sickness that we have so i recommend it it's incredible piece of writing but i'm going to completely shift gears
i'm working through ozark season two i'm net flicks i recommend the show i guess the the the you could title it a little differently it's a named ozark because it's taking place in the ozark mountains and in southeast missouri but it's like parachuting into a family that's been bad for
a really long time
and it's it's just not only is it gripping on its own terms
jason bateman and laura linney are fantastic in it but it's really this interesting exploration of what it's like when crime has become a routine part of your life and then the the reaction when the routine starts to be disrupted it's i can
it's just a really good show i mean part of it is i'm colored by the fact that i've always been a jason bateman fan going all the way back but it's just fantastic it's so well done it's i would say it's a top three or four net flicks show so so if you don't like dark television don't watch it but if you do
if you do like sort of the anti hero genre you're really appreciate that show
my chatter also a quick double so the upshot at the new york times both the most interesting data analysis anywhere and they have a really fantastic
interactive feature up this week and it's about how we are connected to each other and uses facebook as the tool to understand it so it looks a different count every county in the united states and says if you live in that county how likely are you to be connected to a person in the next county into any any other county in the united state
dates and to you can see you know if you live in if you live in
dallas texas you're very likely to be connected of course you people nearby counties but in general you'll be connected to people in texas a little bit to people in louisiana and and
so on it spreads out but what's what's interesting is not the ones where people are just naturally connected people live near them which is true everywhere but when there are these weird other kinds of connections and so so the upshot identified a few that are quite remarkable
one is is how history ways on us and so if you look at people who live in chicago and milwaukee who probably in this case in the case of him talk about our african american you can see huge connections in the mississippi delta because these are families it migrated up to chicago and and
no walkie generation to three ago but maintain relationships down and the delta and so there's just there's a heat around now walkie but then nobody this other spot of heat down in in in the delta
in there is another in california in certain parts of the central valley in california their big links to oklahoma because these are still these are the keys who came from oklahoma and the great depression and the dust bowl who are now their descendants live in california but they maintained relationships that are way back and where they came
from so it's it's just a really fun to play around with
and i recommend it highly i also recommend because i cannot get through a week without lol growling the atlas obscure kids book is out today it's called out with obscures explorers guard for the world's most adventurous kid it's beautiful it goes to more than one hundred of the world's most magical and replaces the gates of hell and turkmenistan earth and
mexican cave which has crystals as big as elephants or to sneak island if you have a kid who's five five to one hundred and five years old they were like the atlas obscure kids book check it out it's really really good if you saw original book you'll probably love this kid's book and of course we've been collecting listener chatter
you dear listeners have been giving us great suggestions about what you were listening to watching reading absorbed with
and we encourage you to keep sending us great ideas at athlete
yeah fast
fast with your with your cocktail chatter ideas and this week comes from deb as rail at dead as rail she says
the new york public library grow up many lending library program a project for new york public library and it's fantastic because what does it do it allows people to checkout ties and briefcases and handbags if they are going to a job interview so if you're if you're a person in good standing at the library if you don't have outstanding fines and you've gotta go to a job interview and you've got to make yourself
look presentable but maybe you don't have a close for it you can go to the public library and check that out
check this out for a brief time i love that idea it's great good for you near coupler library for coming up with that
that is our show for the day the guy festus produced by just on franco researcher british laugh you can follow us on twitter and at slate get best for emily bows on and for david french of the national review institute thank you for coming in back and time i am the and clots
