and we will have cocktail chatter and before we go any further a reminder december twelfth in new york university scribble center in manhattan we're going to do our annual conundrum show
the time when we gather to pay such important questions as would you rather be a fish or a tree
you can still get tickets that slate dot com slash live please join us
at the scribble center on december twelfth for conundrum show it can be really fun play dot com flashlight for tickets the apparent torture and murder of distant journalist from show by team of saudi hit men inside the saudi embassy in istanbul has turned into an international crisis information
seemingly leaks by the turkish government which has its own reasons for doing this indicates that show he was murdered and dismembered when he went to the embassy to pick up some documents he needed for his wedding
other reporting suggest the murders were extremely close to crown prince muhammad den some on the crown prince's of course the increasing me autocratic ruler is the the ruler in fact that not name of saudi arabia
the young prince who is quite good friends with jared kushner the trump administration which has been hand and pocket with m b s as he is known has contorted itself not to blame the saudis for anything yet
they accepted saudi denials more or less at face value
dispatching compare the secretary of state to saudi arabia and then to turkey to weigh the evidence and at least you know just of make a make a face showing have been interested in this and the president has indicated explicitly that he does not want to disrupt the us had a relationship for this
john in some sense the the the attempt to keep business as usual with the saudis is not that surprising we haven't disrupted business as usual the saudis are murdering thousands of yemeni when they broke off relations with canada over a canadian foreign minister making a mild comment about their human rights when they kidnap the lebanese
mr and so on and so on
why is the us government and in particular the trump administration even more than us government them of have so willing and eager to work with the saudi government and to turn a blind eye to their repeated misbehavior
well there's a there's a series of different reasons
some with more proof than others
and they range everything from
military orders the saudis have booked which is different than money name checks i've already written but things they said they wanted by which is where the president gets his one hundred and ten billion dollar figure experts say that the numbers closer to twenty billion but they are big purchase of us
arms and
every time you sound the plane you're not just telling them and plane you're showing them the parts and all of that so that's the argument presidents made it's about jobs but the big reason the geo strategic reason is that to saudi arabia is helping the united states with its number one priority and in the region and maybe it's a number one priority but probably number two to north korea iran
so saudi arabia is is at the center of and iran focused us mission in the middle east
and then the other reason is that the president has bragged about having interest in saudi arabia in the past and his son in law also has interests financial interests in saudi arabia and so there's a web of interconnected news that the private level some of which is opaque and so that may or may not
be involved here
you could imagine it not needing to be involved because of the primacy of the iranian focus of and that's the focus from people like bolton and i'm pale which who don't have financial ties to saudi arabia
emily what do you think it is about the show be murder i'm going to call it a murder because although we don't know for certain yet they're cute preponderance of evidence and rather than have to couch and each time i'm just going to say what what is it about the show the murder that has inviting international outrage
that all these other incidents including the ongoing war crimes in yemen did not why is it causing people to withdraw from and b s's huge splash he davos in the desert conference and casting doubt on whether you can even continue to be the crown prince
i mean if you're talking about loss of life and you're being completely rational and counting then the atrocities in yemen are far worse and leave ignored damn you know at our moral power peril for a while now but i think first of all jamal khashoggi had a lot of friends in washington
he was someone who is well liked by people on the press corps there are a lot of people with personal connections tan line and position to make a fuss and i think the thing is just that germanic nature of this crime and been described is horrifying ways and it seems as if it was carried out by
did were very close to the crown prince of saudi arabia who is himself very close to jared kushner and so there's just this sense of personal involvement it makes it feel like a kind of mafia killing or just their head of state eliminating someone is politics he didn't care for and that kind of breath
taking blatant way and they think there's just something about that that on has distressed people and captured their imaginations and you know sometimes the narrative of one person and how abuse of power affects one human being can transcend a bloody conflict like the one in yemen in which there are lots of people who
are being terribly harmed but they remain kind of a mass of face last people to us whereas i care is this one guy we can see pictures of her family can read his words his fiance was waiting for him outside the embassy walls as the consulate walls i mean they're just all these reasons to identify with ten and strongly in their story
you know science wouldn't be the first time that the united states made a decision
a moral decision
in its strategic interests that was against its human rights rhetoric
i mean honestly the first grade so in a sense with the president is doing in appearing to slow walk this we don't know the full story but one thing that is so jarring is that we know what this president looks like when he is on the hunt for suspicious information he does it regularly but he also rose to power as a political for
figure by being relentless in his pursuit of the truth about barack obama is kenyan birth so when it comes to the kenyan birth know piece of information is too insignificant
and all information is credible and then in this case nothing seems to be credible in terms of the way the president reacting the way each reacting as a way you could argue a president should react which is with restraint let the facts get in there are other equities at play here he may know it's it isn't public but again relative to his reaction in all these other cases and it does matchups
pattern of a seeming disinterest in the and authoritarian sluggishness of latimer couldn't kim jong il and duarte so
it is he comes within his his pattern just on need to yemen point and not only in saudi arabia
a bombing there but the un report of a week ago and claim that saudi arabia was responsible for at least twelve hundred deaths of children
and in some cases the munitions they're using in the prosecution of this military action or munitions it bought from united states
dig into that point of yours and this is the age of impunity this is the age where if you're a lot more potent you can assassinate people you don't like on british soil using chemical agent
if you are the north korean leader you can you can use a nerve agent in the middle of a incredibly busy airport and malaysia to kill an enemy if you're china you can kidnap ahead of interpol and imprison a million weaker citizens and yet
it has no consequence for any of it i totally understand the need for rail politic in the world my i'm not in any sense an idealist but it is pretty shocking to see how far the united states has strayed from its avowed support for human rights for solve
and it's and
not only is it that the trump says nothing when these things happen said he couples that with criticism and attacks on the countries which do support democratic ideals and which are do behave with respect and dignity towards its citizens were where our biggest enemy is the countries that are getting the full rhetorical brunt of the united states
canada and germany and meanwhile we have assassinations occurring in embassies and atrocities occurring
all over the world it's it's very very disheartening
right doesn't he actually gets it gets going to be a costs that we're going to bear in the future because we have lost america has not always lived up to it's ideal often been cynical it is often overlooked as emily you'd be pointed out overlooked a human rights issues when when it has needed to but we've been
at least to be minus on it now we're a d and it's going to be a cost we we are no longer a moral beacon in the world are we increasingly seem to not want to be immoral be can and that's a big problem usually there's about a counterbalance so the us may not act perfectly in all cases but there are cases in which there's real effort to try to live up to and
spread the ideas of human rights and in this case there's the balance seems out of whack and in the other thing that is i think this is an occasion i think about is whether our priorities are focused on iran is a cracked one and whether that is part of why we're being led astray i mean we think of saudi arabia we wanna think the bad as it
partner and fighting terrorism that some of the saudis on tactics breed terrorism and you know the it is an autocratic monarch call unaccountable regime that we have more or less supported for many years because of our own tactical decisions and you know president obama express
some reservations about that and some desire to distance are south and edge sounds and hold the saudis at arm's length and i think what we've seen less champ and particularly with kushner are these very close relationship is john mentioned earlier may or may not be tied to their own financial interest and you know you see kushner making a
bad on the asked mohammad den som man that seems like a terrible that to make in terms of human rights and that were that he is embolden ing someone who is not going to be a good leader for his country either domestically or internationally so for also just thinking here about judgment
and about you know all the responsibility and praise that trump lavished on kushner especially early on in the administration you really have to one here wonder here especially because of the reports that us intelligence picked up that the saudis were planning to detain jamal khashoggi before he showed up at that consulate and we don't seem to have warren ham or done anything
that map
i think the m b ask questions
complicated the thing he is the alternative to is also terrible the thing that he is the alternative to was a monarch system that was heavily corrupt also supporting very theologically conservative in fact radical islamist theology all across the world and spreading it a country that
if anything less democratic than what he wants to make it more in many ways more repressive than what he wants to make it less open to the world than what he wants to make it and yet he hit he himself is now proving to be an autocrat a dictator thug a villain murder of the were sword and so it's not i mean with
weird as that is not that somehow saudi arabia has taken some really dark turn to a much darker place has just taken a dark turn into a different dark place it was in a dark place
as you have no good alternatives than don't make a big that rendered agreement yeah yeah yeah that's how i'm his own i know million like i'm all iran and iranians are just texans there in a text message a dark hair
it is important to remember the saudi arabia it was the location of the president's first foreign trip it was the ball the chips were moved him to his
that that wasn't just because they had happened to work for the itinerary it was it was
chosen in specific for a specific reason with it for a real orientation of us policy and a big bet on saudi arabia
yeah and our relationship with saudi arabia is essentially built on two pilloried are out built on a shared cent of set of values are shared set of principles of how country should be governed or people should be treated it's built on oil and arms sales which to are two things which i certainly would like to reduce in the world that the spread of lots of
us time to saudi arabia to me multiplies the danger in the middle east and creates more likely that there are more things like yemen and more likely that there's a war between iran and saudi arabia between their proxies and i don't want to live in a world where all we were fully dependent on saudi oil being pumped and keeping saudi oil prices low that seems like a tear
bubble world and one less dependency on that must use of it so i'm all for a turn away but i don't i'm not sure that there's any grand
coalition to turn away from saudi arabia
these days anymore but there's not a grand coalition to support saudi arabia in the senate
marco rubio said there is no saudi arabia caucus
and so
will be interesting to see the pressure if there is any pressure or what the power the president divergence from from his from from republicans her one thing i've been wondering about his tongue i'm not sure that's the right word for it that you know there's this real party like we don't want the saudis tears stop pumping
while because that could really canal throw a huge wrench into the world economy gas prices could soar like can have bad and we don't want to stop the arms sales because we like that money and then there's you know my palm pale shelling out and being all jovial and laughing at this moment of great seriousness making it seem like
this is just acceptable behavior that the us is ready to just completely
brush by and i had the same thing when i was listening to jump say almost in one breath and not giving covered anything saudi arabia is this arms deal is really great for us and we do that's a business for them so he was giving cover in this moment where he claimed not to be it was incredibly clear and i mean if you are like
a real critic of us foreign policy and you think the us is always a cynical actor then you might be like okay well now it's out in the open you know good we have a washington post lead today on thursday which says that the us in saudi arabia are searching for a mutually agreeable explanation for show his disappearance
let's just show the complicity and have it all out there but i do think that it matters a great deal whether the united states is explicitly condoning and looking past this kind of murder it's scary to have us just off the moral compass entirely either
no i see the hypocrisy in the past i'd still think i'd rather have some sense of limits even if it's incomplete and flawed and etc while the hypocrisy did some did some work in the past which is that it that some limb is some limits and kept some countries from misbehaving and ultimately
the idea that you're fighting for truth and honesty in the american way ends up being the saying that marshals
american men and women who go fight in the service of their country is that you know that we're the good guys and we stand up for the right things i mean that's the i'm not saying in this specific case but it is it's all on that same continuum the person yeah yeah i mean i guess the other thing i keep thinking about is that i feel like the delphi for
the trump era is gonna come do dramatically later but we kind of see these foreshadowing submit and this is one of them and none of the foreshadowing seemed to be big enough on their own to change the political dynamic inside the united states sufficiently but you can imagine how in the future where
gonna look back and be able to like trace the bread crumbs to a different kind of world order and weaker democracy that's certainly true that the deficit this week
yes that's a good thing to bring and right now exactly speaking of bells coming do just one final point on that actually which is i think it's important to recognize there is no saudi caucus as you say in the us senate john there's a huge saudi caucus for saudi money for investment
and every company in silicon valley every company that that wants capital is is trying to get a cut of of saudi money i mean through i go out and pitch my company and talk to venture funds and private equity people and a lot of them have saudi money and their funds and spend a lot of time
i'm going to go into saudi arabia and meeting with the various power brokers there and so so wallet is it's the case that those folks they don't want to be associated with with murders and they don't they don't want to be associated with a with a thug regime the poll of all that money is very very powerful and and yet
people withdraw from this conference which i suspect actually has the biggest threat that feels right now is at this conference is going to be a fiasco but they'll come back of the money is they're they're going to come back with that money is it's extremely green and there are huge huge puddle

senator elizabeth warren announced the results of a dna test this week thunder warren who like like so many of us who are good students i think it's always expecting all test results to be good test results was very happy to announce the results of this test and probably thought it would prove triumphant instead it's been a result it
in a huge backlash
warren was of course attempting to prove that she did have native american ancestry and bust that trumps slur of her his constant calling her pocahontas was even more baseless than it seemed she instead scored what we call an own goal in soccer and in politics he made herself look foolish he reduced herself to trumps level
and last and she irritated really really irritated people who are to support her
so isn't as lane a cherokee nation should be just say another name mac engraved yes and emily can you just should have given the background about why weren't ancestry
became an issue to begin with because i think some of it locate to from ivy league law schools a place that you places that you know well
embarrassingly it's out so i mean elizabeth one did not get her job at harvard because she claimed to be native american she as far as we can tower has explicitly no implying and benefit from it and she made that really clear in as five minute video that she released however however did claim her
one plane as like the first minority end to get tenure she checked the box on a farm for the it's called the last the american association of law schools anyway and like a law professor directory basically so she said his lead clean in a small but significant way to having his heritage now
you know she says this is based on family law and that she was like expressing pride in this part of her heritage
okay except did you know making anything that seems to be a sort of self interested claim of having native american heritage is questionable thing to do especially because tribal slow tribal identity is you know really important matter for tribes how
you establish that you're a member of a child daycare a lot about it and they have their own rules and ways of preceding that are not based on dna they're based on a longing and family ties and you know directly been impacted by being part of the tribe so i feel a blind throughout this has been in
sufficiently send staff to put it nicely to those interest and so okay so she takes the stand a task and in the sort of basic straightforward way she can i guess she did it to say to chant like luck you said you'd pay me a million dollars if i could prove that i had indian heritage luck i just proved that
now be quiet but it just to do that without talking to the cherokee nation and figuring out how they were going to feel about what was essentially a political stunt i just don't understand that all like i don't understand on a human level it seems mean and on a political level it seems like
own goals like a nice way to put it i just don't get it and you know you can say like given all the things all the if if you're a liberal like elizabeth warren has lots to recommend her policy wise and character why is that this is some kind of blind spot that is troubling i don't know how else to think about having
ran all the responses from the native americans who just seem like this i mean especially given our history of how we have treated in decimated native american tribes to be an american politician that doesn't seem to really care about how they're going to react to your self interest to claims about your heritage like i have stunk
here's would seem striking to me democrats are
twenty days away or little less than twenty days away from a huge big mid term where everybody's is a nationalized election route wants to keep the eye on the ball why would you do this three weeks out when your party is know needs to stay focused on the never benefits from culture wars know precisely right and
that's that's my next territory here which is it seems to me that when you getting one of these stupid political fight would you want to do is get into a stupid political fight where if people can't follow the details of why you're fighting they never the less have communicated to them you're deep interest in a thing that they care a lot about and
think they're a lot of people out there who care about this question of identity or not identity now
you could say well what they care about as they want to see a fighter for the democratic cause against this president who is fights in a different way okay but if that's the case this is not a victory in the wily primary right the wily primary is who is more widely than donald trump and whose michael of an audience
is pronounced bathing is winning that he's trying he's trying to participate in the wily primary everybody on the left is going to have to and one in one way or another participate in the wily primary to show that they are more widely them donald trump against to mayor going to have to go up and this was a bit in that i don't think in law
yeah yeah and the lost in a bad time at a time where democrats it seems to me if i were a democrat i would want to see somebody fighting on my issues in his and to be really fair to her this is what i was with foreign when people used to watch your you tube videos that's what they used to watch is her fighting on
kind of traditional democratic issues in a way democrats like to see their candidates fight and so she's replaced her herself is that we have herself as this for the moment for what his a new cycle what south park
been frustrating about this is not only does not trump trumpet basically confirmed the attack
that's fair know his attack which was a racist and gross attack but the the subtext of that attack was it wasn't really about did she have native and history or not it was she taking was she virtue signal into she taking advantage of it in the game in her elite snooty ivy league university and getting
privilege out of it
i don't think she did that as a university professor but she certainly trying to do that now she's trying to virtue signal now she's trying to indicate some connection which she hasn't earned she's a white woman who has some as we all do somewhere and her pass something happened way i think you're being a little unfair hear what like wow
she does i mean i don't i don't i'm so disinterested and of the stand a stuff like this is convinced me that i am as person who's going to kill the last but i will just to stick up for on the fact checking friend and now i'm relying on gland cast lot of the washington post she does have more native american
suggestive dna and the rest of us like and she does have this family story of some sort of tinge of racism and prejudice of her father's family toward their mother's family
like that anyway that's feeble also you don't know anymore was in the messages aren't even have a dna test as far as i know i don't have a girl i know i'm
elders and your family
yeah here and it wasn't in the united states whose families that you know you get the test who knows and is it is also clear that there's nothing in her life nothing meaningful her life suggests that her native ancestry insofar as she has it has been a like a significant fact in her life at all she's not someone who's who's spent time
on reservations she's not someone who has deeply studied native law she's not someone who's worked and eight of law i don't think and so to to associate herself with it at all is just lane and it smacks of the kind of that kind of pc showmanship that gets so many people riled up
and it just she should never have talked about you should have rushed out the route the column about that she should have just said you know that was a bit was wrong to to like talking about that and never talked about it again never had a dna test never talked about the dna test if she did have it it's just everything she did on this was wrong headed and and i can't
the
they of it is so profound it's really frustrating
i agree with that never tagging i mean i totally agree with like not checking off the box not doing the dna test time i guess i'm like eighty percent with you than that i didn't like you have a family a story about your family that captures your imagination and some way that doesn't offend me what offends me is over claiming for it and not like aligning your
claims with the people whose lives are really affected people in the cherokee nation or other tribes
it seems also if you're gonna do come combat with the president on values and and identities stuff when a whim and also there's other there's other territory which isn't anything to do with you personally about where you might get
i don't know it's not it's not a great played for pick your terms of yeah yeah
of that one thing know that i like breeding for today reminded me of caught using pocahontas as an insult as horrible can we just just check that off like it
pocahontas is based on a real teenager who is effectively kidnapped and who died when she was twenty one i think in britain or she was like spirited there i just i didn't totally understand how disgusting it is to go around making that into a joke it's really gross and that is on on trapped not island
but warm
then you should know by the way this was the week of course foods to us which is jackie though different
i guess we're even another that trumps whatever trump says
trumps original a fault with fifty times worse than than morons feeble perry if just she just didn't need to do it
think to change the subject a lot the dna tests are good for the world do you think this information reveals anything that really helps us have understanding connection or more principally a source for alienation and a miss reliance on blood over over the actual thing that shaped you
the culture the family grew up around the place up in a friend who grew up around that's such a good class getting really great i struggle with this because a a general kids and born to be pro fact and pro information and dna is just a piece of information so why should i be lying around time
not to find out about themselves i do think that we don't really understand what it means on there was huge confusion and the reporting of elizabeth warren's dna results
and i think we over over interpret our genetic makeup yeah i'm in this did make me think about how totally in curious i am and about this and i hadn't really thought like i was just being lazy that's not just laziness like i just don't care about this at all i don't think and
maybe it's because i have an incredibly boring
ashkenazi jewish genetic makeup as far as i know so i don't there's really only grew up for that or do you or do i but i have had friends who have gotten quite unsettling recent information from do it and twenty three and me in terms of their health and andrew
in japan who is not your parent as it turns out like something else was gone on that will that
yeah that's you don't want you don't
that i don't know maybe you do on that i mean i'm not sure whether that's good or bad but it it is not made me anyway i just think the whole thing gets over we get over invested in and think about it too much
ancestry where you're where you people came from part because i have is that i tell myself i'm in my particular my mother's side is a most of them i mean it's amusing on them if it's true
i'm probably a quarter irish but behave like i'm eighty five percent irish and so i'd like that
know where the rest of me comes from because everything and went dead so his brother joe home
cause i got hi matthew i'm interested in the geographical aspects of a i think
i am curious but i'm totally unclear serious about the kind of notion of from the that i'm discovering family or that i'm somehow discovering character by discovering income family secret your family is the people who raise you spend time with you got through your family
no ambiguity somebody who's a who gave oh
impregnated someone three generations ago
or someone who donated sperm is not a father on a parent
that's nothing to do with it and there's this
spend all this time to my sperm donor
brooke and sperm donor region of and i really became i really got unhappy watching children look for their father they were looking for their father and i always felt like that people are not your father there be supplied some genetic material which has helped shape you i'm not saying that the genes certainly have an affair
on you but
the only thing the only person who can be a father someone who is who is present and and acting in your life that genetic effect is not that is not real it's hugely real but it's not that person is not does not matter
endless the further you go back in your genetic make up then you wind up like you know what if i wasn't one hundred percent ashkenazi jewish and i had some other like dna that i i'd still be my white jewish self because you know as you were saying before about elizabeth warren i've never
like been impacted by being part something else it would be like ridiculous to go around and suddenly claiming that that was had some significance in my life whereas people who look like that have a close relative who is black or hispanic or something else like that's a different experience up the world right i mean that's where
i feel like you have to be sensitive and specific and how you let people to find themselves
by the way i'll make a better if you're under twenty three main yourself that you are not one hundred percent of the jewish find good that would be more interesting i be totally happy about that but again i don't think it was given that that's my own sense of by heritage and saw only thing i've got going culturally i feel like you'd be silly to then suddenly be like oh i'm there i don't
i'm italian and i'm italian or know this
i came over here because of that potato famine famine in ireland just like dogs fan

there was a brilliant essay by as required and box the region of american politics
the came out this week the very short but i phone
astonishing piece that pulled together a lot of a troubling themes and american political life
the senate underrepresented the most populous states the sham of the electoral college presidents lutheran popular vote the rigging of congressional district birth by german during and locking in of for incumbents the manipulation of campaign finance laws in a way that particularly helps one party the use of unheard of
tactics to lock in an ideological majority and supreme court
the basic unfairness of a system that requires democrats to win
international national group by eight points just to play even the unfit stability of the constitution the disenfranchisement and franchise meant of citizens in dc and puerto rico
the concerted campaign over the past decade or two to reduce loading by people who are more likely to vote for democrats
using tactics that are racist sometimes and slimy most of the time
and what as or conclude from this is that would create a politics where the left no longer increasingly doesn't believe in legitimacy of the american political system
the right by contrast will believe that any effort to change those rules
to balance it in a way that liberals the left would like to balance it that any effort like that would would also be illegitimate and that therefore we're in a standoff
in a stand off with with a conservative minority
putting a chokehold on a lot of political power no clear way to fix it to allow populist power or to allow democrats to alter their candidates majority it's majority power in his argument you just populist or democrat it's just majority death
so to use that one case that he said that's not really what the topic of this this segment is but also say that on flowers
the focus of this is on one case where some piece of this is an action which is in georgia where the secretary of state republican bryant camp is in charge of elections in the fairness of election
he is also the republican intended for governor and he stayed on the job
secretary of state state even as he run for governor
just some of his predecessors did also running for governor have knocked on they stepped down from the job and he appears to be a gauge in a campaign to disenfranchise voters who are more likely be democratic and more likely be african american so what's the what's what does that said that camp is doing what does it said that is going on in georgia
so can is what's the word suspending i suppose the registration of fifty three thousand people who tried to register to vote in georgia because of what's called the exact match role and this is a policy georgia has been and can have been trying to put into place for years have previously been in previous generations
they were blocked by the department of justice from doing this now we don't have the o j playing that role anymore and the exact match program means that if there's any tiny error in spelling a missing hyphen you use like you know dave instead of david as the first name you don't get to be officially registered
hard and that can happen if the county officials entering the data makes the error so a small error means that your registration gets kind of held in some nether world now i want to say really quickly that this does not mean you can't vote you can still vote and if you bring and
election officials recognize your i d you can even vote regularly and not conditionally so all these folks who have gotten these letters from the drawing secretary of state can still show up at the polls but it's to send them a confusing letter suggesting that there's a problem with their registration is to suppress their vote and the
few states that use this exact the exact match system are places like kansas where chris kyle back who's like even higher on the pantheon then brian camp of trying to i would say limit access to the ballot that's like this is his kind of tactic florida did this one point
under another republican administration bad was making other active efforts to throw people off the rolls you know look always with this question that's a balance do you want people to be fraudulent signing up to vote no we don't do we have evidence that that's really a problem of any magnitude know we do not have that evidence we have
lots of evidence of people being blocked from voting or what i call sort of a soft block burners
yeah exactly
and it just so happens that seventy percent of the people who got these letters are african american even though i think it's something like thirty two percent of registered voters in george are african american so we see you know racially desperate outcomes here and then we see bryan camp saying like there's nothing wrong with this i'm just do
doing my job this is you know has no racial implications and that is just hard to swallow on its face states abrams who's the democratic candidate from georgia
and i should say disclosure a former law school classmate of mine of whom i am fond you know she has been waging this battle in georgia for years to try to increase voter registration and camp has been her phone that and so what we're seeing or national headlines about a long running bad all which is
you started out framing david you know ezra klein's peace does a really good job of pulling back and showing how this is like one piece in this mosaic or seeing right now that runs counter to majority majority rule and the country
it seems like the one piece of his argument that is
possibly seems more fixable
maybe i'm miriam
deluded but
because somebody because he's bigger argument that's what's interesting about it is his argument is the structural flaw exists so it's not the things you don't like about american this is his argument where they grew they're not and south of the things you don't write about america or the result of the behaviors of the various people it's beyond the structure itself is broken
produce argument to is that people are exploiting the broken nose
but anyway
david one quick point before your when the question
fascinates me hear about this and to the extent that it becomes a national story is that the political science research suggests some time that people get quite motivated when they think their voters being taken away from them in this election one of the questions was going to be whether minority voters were going to turn out for democrats across the country in the numbers the democrats would like them to turn out
georgia maybe a special case because of socio rooms but whether this becomes a turnip mechanism more broadly because african americans obviously being denied the vote is pretty much central to the effort and her story in american history
that was kind of the question was actually going to ask you john which is that there is this notion of as you say and political science literature that the attention to voter suppression tactics increases the turn out of people who feel threatened and i i think there's clearly some evidence of that but it also feel like voter suppression gotten pretty good and it is
true that people give up when it's convenient to vote they go to the wrong polling place and they can't don't have time to get to the right one the the line is too long because the machines aren't very good at around of people are that they've closed a bunch of polling places and consolidated moments of the lions too long and you can't be late for work or election there's not enough early voting and the only to you can vote
on election day but you you've got to work on election day or you've got to get home the line as long at the end of the day and you've got to get home at take care of your kid and there's so many inconveniences that pile up that even that motivation that happens which i do think clearly see and and clearly saw when people are murdered vote they will stand among line well
indoor more the
the
the tactics to discourage people from voting are pretty excellent as well and i am not i'm or
that that the motivation fighters winning over the inconvenience side right now one of the interesting things to watch and test is whether whether you call it voter suppression or and attempt to just kind of there are two things is one which is really trying to do something that's borderline illegal other is to to spend money and
on social media to just kind of depressed turn out by just bombing out different groups and keep which which is in which may be underhanded but is within the boundaries i mean it's within you know
really trying to press the turn on the outside and that was something the trunk campaign was it was successful in doing in the presidential election and what surprised me is that as a tactical matter the democrats haven't kind of tried to bolt told us together and which is goes to your point david which makes this more of a sustainable argument which is in other words
usually so voter suppression has been useful because it's happened quietly as you say the efforts are are good they're hard to sometimes identify they have been quickly him but in this case you could imagine a situation which somebody takes the voter suppression efforts or even a hint of them and ties them to a larger discontent among people of color
with the entire term presidency which would seem to me to keep it in the news or give it more energy than than than simply the narrow issue of is your vote being denied you that's a really good point especially because while some of those disinformation tactics are within the bounds of the first amendment if there
paid for by foreigners i e russia has no luck
fair there are no longer least
foreign influence in our actions that is both illegal and not something that most americans want to think is the reason that our elections go the way they do
do you guys think to you
dude
the shape of ezra his argument about the relative remember politics was very familiar but it does in much more like a national political issue than a local political issue that at the local and state level not that there's not manipulation we see in states like wisconsin in north carolina that that strong republican majorities of attempted to change the rules to institutionalize
is broken power disenfranchised places where where democrats traditionally have had influence so it's not it's not completely a pair playing field that the state level but the state level politics is is much less subject to this and therefore maybe that's a that's an area where where democrats should focus their efforts
other than trying to the national national political winds are so much harder as we see with the senate
this year and even with the house this year and therefore a lot of state level focus where politics is more responsive and and more fair might be a better place to emphasize so that such an interesting argument because traditionally it's republicans and conservatives who have invested a lot of energy and state
offices and and thinking about federalism and the power of the states and liberals and democrats have
had more faith in the national government so here's one downside of you just suggested the federal government has enormous resources in power ever more sell it becomes hard to ignore if you wanna have policies that affect lots of americans lives you know it is like the elephant in the room
but of course your raid that some states
or easier for democrats to take control of i guess what i wonder about we start going down this road is whether we're talking about a more and more divided country and which where you live determines a lot of things about the shape of your life and that's ok because like people can move in that goes but there's something and
settling a bad let me think of the national social compact about having places that you know really differ from each other in terms of deep policy matters
i think i want to say about these questions about the democratic process we're talking about is that democrats when they have been in power has thus far
in a lot of places and certainly on the national level not seen this as an urgent question so there are ways to start shifting this power balance right leg national automatic voter registration could change the picture david lean hired of the times was talking this week about adding senators from dc in puerto rico because he did a piece showing
you know white tee ball benefit from what he called affirmative action based simply on the composition of the senate there are ways to we tell the playing field and thus far those kind of structural fixes have not been particularly high on the democratic party's agenda and i wonder if we're going to start to see that change
change the bombing structural six is is that we
going back and spending some time with
president mann awesome and when you listen to the debates they had first of all the continental congress being totally in secret so that they can think and talk and have a debate without it leaking is seems awfully quaint but also great useful but also the fact that everybody has an argument and a discussion and then because they believe in the structure of the debate that they're having
they all kind of agree with the outcome even if they didn't agree with what the actual outcome is they believe that the structure in the process created a good outcome
a problem with all these reforms which are very appealing on some certain level or at least appealing to discuss because whether you agree with the solution or not you enjoy and learning about the various component parts of the discussion is that we can even have proper arguments any more
at a public level with good faith on both sides so the structural flaws make it hard to fix the structure

behind us and we will go get a drink
oh
very strong cocktail
at a local watering hole and john when you're having your very strong cocktail when you're going to be chattering about when you went
a tough week and that's why in addition to turning to non alcoholic methods of alleviating your stress you might also turned to a cocktail but nick cage
a tough week
past week he found himself on the way to work and then was suddenly hurtling towards planet earth at the speed of sound feeling six times the force of gravity because he was the american astronaut on the pointy end of that rocket that the so use russian space
camps that exploded on launch but he and his russian colleague in the
have and made it down to earth in which is amazing
and why did they do this because they prepared for two years for basically every kind of thing that could go wrong so when they were spinning in the huge vita mix heading in hurtling towards earth they were able to complete their little checklist of things or the valves working is our orientation right how's the rescue crew doing but they did it in russian
cause we don't we just americans just hit tribes and on and so i use now because we don't send rockets into space to the space station that way so he had to do it all in russian and then when he landed safely thank goodness he basically
interviews he did this week he said well you know sometimes things happen and you don't get a vote so this time we just roll with the punches
because he's not going to goods not like there's another one leaving tomorrow you know he's now going to have to wait so you just reminded me another way in which space exploration we know about it in all of its glory and when it discovers and the kind of romantic things that we discover but sometimes even in failure you see something incredibly admirable which in this case was his equity
smitty and is the incredible preparation and grace under pressure that happened in this and i should also known as a stark matter there is a time when the russians and the americans use to measure their rocket programs as a proxy for how quickly they could destroy the other with their nuclear rockets so the fact that when they land
did he reached over to his russian power sitting next to him and shook his hand and then they joked about how fast their flight was seems to me to some be some sort of hope
in the turning of history that you know it's about fifty years after we were on the brink of going to war with the russians and now we're through the space race and then we're operating
i had not heard about that i just read the story if you were talking about a while instead of listening to john you and read that i he was telling the story
both
emily what is your one hundred and sixty proof chatter
i'm gonna sneak in a tattered today
i want to recommend a beautiful piece in the new york times magazine this week by a dear friend of mine dwayne that's it's called getting out and it's about drains odyssey from being convicted of carjacking in virginia when he was sixteen to graduating from law school and being admitted the bar in connecticut
which was not not a done deal that connecticut by seemed to be uncertain about whether to had met him and dwayne persevered and just rates about his experiences with tremendous perspective and heart a law makes you think and and make you feel a lot of emotions as peace i think sell its
called getting out and dwayne worked at my beloved added in atlanta summer minutes just to so go read it and then i also wanted to tell her about remarkable and a trail on the houston chronicle kind for what they call a judicial sweet and the misdemeanor courts so the editorial board is recommending that voters tough
out every judge in misdemeanor courts and harris county that is done and its suburbs who has opposed bail reform there's been this fight now far more than a year over implementing an order from a federal judge that was kind for ending just terrible system
a cash ballon misdemeanor quiets where people are having like literally five second hearings and getting consigned to jail for months before trial on because they had this very high bal sat sell this federal judge leave rosenthal through out the system back in may two thousand and seventeen and there's been a lot of wrangling and over it and resist
tens from a whole bunch of judges they've spent millions of dollars in public money in fighting this order in the meantime bal and charlie's can continue to be kind of mixed up and problematic and harris county and sell the houston chronicle and time voters take get rid of all of these folks i think
it's like ten or more judges who they are crying for being thrown out so i'll be just really interesting to see what happens this issue on election day
my chatter
first a little law grow and self promotion
begging else obscure my company has so many great jobs available right now come and work with me and an amazing calling from brooklyn were hiring a designer achieve commercial officer or a digital advertising sales director a photo editor
program manager for trips and newsletter editor that a lot of great job and to get out with obscure that complex job
the place to be and we have so many fun interesting people working in armor up to so many fun interesting thing so come join me
my chatter is about another slate cast actually i know you have heard of talk and probably other people in your world talk about slow burn the pod cast that me i'm nate far has done for played over the past year or so the first season was of course about watergate the second season has been known about the lewinsky scandal
i just want to urge you to listen to the final episode of flow bernadine if you don't listen to the rest of it it isn't absolutely extraordinary episode because it's about the story of one need or broderick and it has an interview with wanted a broader when he broke records
the woman who described at the time this happened been raped by bill clinton in a hotel room in arkansas when he was a gubernatorial candidate you then the attorney general
and her account of that rape is exceptionally persuasive she told other people about it at the time
in ways that pretty great credit to her story it's absolutely persuasive and bearing and what its own
the slow burn up so not only goes into her her accusation of rape it also goes into how that hung over the impeachment
behind the scenes and impeachment
bill clinton during know the wind ski case
where it was a shadow over but it wasn't actually part of it and it couldn't officially become part of the impeachment proceedings even though was i think by far the most damning charge against him and i also think it gives us a new way to think about how why there's such continued region conservative media and i'm conservative
about double standards and and how clinton manifest and the double standards and the most egregious way that he was it sex criminal who is literally a criminal literally a rapist if you're to believe broderick and this
evidence of wrongdoing was essentially quashed by complicit media and he was allowed to get away with it and then hide behind sanctimony about republican a witch hunting and this doesn't in any sense justify anything that donald trump or cabinet has done but it does get that we
but a hard time getting it why they're so much conservative hatred and disappointment enraged bill clinton and this is how to explain it
really help explain it and it really also helps explain it to i came away from thinking i never want to hear another fucking word from bill clinton and hillary clinton again i just don't want to that story it is it's it's it's an appalling story it's a story that he should never been allowed to to be dog catcher
arkansas a given if that's true
and also just too bad
to your point
they also ate all the enabler who heard and heard the story over the years and didn't get very curious about it
and who are now in the neighbors they would say either in the democratic institutions democratic politicians enabling press they said who heard those stories and didn't really do anything about it and now when they hear stories with one tenth of
their credibility were evidence nevertheless jump all over it because a political polarity has changed anyway so please listen to that episode of slow burn it's the final episode and it's just really is it's a thing that it's made me think most of all the things that have been going on over the last few weeks
we also got great listener chapters this week once again you have your cocktail parties must be incredible parties to be it i would love invitations your cocktail parties
so you are treating us like get for some time you're posting to our facebook page this week we have media vasquez who is one of several listeners who pointed to the story the gym fallows did in the atlantic making their case certainly know raising the possibility that gary hart's collapse and then
in nineteen eighty seven when when he was photographed with donna rice on a chartered boat called the monkey business
that may have been a set up orchestrated by by republican trickster and operative lee atwater and i think the case that has made is circumstantial best but it's really interesting read
get a look at them
i mean you've essentially says that this friend of gary hart's was paid because he needed money by lee atwater to basically set up this photograph set up the night stay by hard on this boat and then set up the photograph where the famous photograph were done rice's on his lap and he's wearing a shirt called earth and a shirt
wild monkey business or that up the book called them like he's wearing a shirt the word monkey business is in the photograph and i can't remember what that was the name of the boat and was a part of what torpedoed is his presidential career that year
you know what's funny about the hard thing no going back to your point david is if there was seen at the time has an overreaching the presses obsession with the sexual pack billows of their candidates that obsession actually you know it didn't it didn't obviously stop bill clinton being elected any kind of went away i mean can you image
and the teams of people that would have been dispatched to cover president trumps poconos as a candidate where this nine hundred eighty eight
the fever of of character investigations into the central practice of seems to have actually been his lesson today then and i don't trust me with donald trump there been other candidates were where are the the coverage wasn't you know the teams and investigators weren't sent out so it's just an interesting moment in presidential history
there's a consistent point there though because john edwards was totally ruined by that but not during the campaign people knew better during the campaign didn't report on newt gingrich subsequent to the gary hart thing people knew he was having an affair didn't report on it during impeachment that's what i mean in the hard case he was and it was idiosyncratic because heart was a certain kind of canada but it was seen in wake of watergate
as a character test we need to test and figure out in campaigns whether the character of our candidates is sufficiently good because you know character can lead you to these awful or character flaws can lead to these awful outcomes which of which watergate was an example of course in the watergate case the character richard nixon it and perfectly clean private life but it was this idea that investigate
patients into character of that kind were a part of the presidential campaign and i i think at least in the hot
this was true with investigations into dole and mccain and others that didn't happen but we're in the background of campaigns that never made it to light
that our shephard their the gap it's produced by jeff on frank or researchers dunlap you should follow us on twitter at athlete
yeah fest for emily valve on john dickerson they may clog thanks for listening and come to work conundrum show december twelfth the new york city
calm flash live for tickets we will talk to you next week
