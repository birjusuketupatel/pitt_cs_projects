first topic today we know that there are a ton of women running for office four hundred seventy six women failed to run just for house seats in the twenty eight thousand election that was sixty percent more than the previous high in two thousand and twelve and two hundred thirty five of those women when their primaries which
was up from one hundred and sixty seven in two thousand and sixteen which was performer record
but in addition to that quantifiable jump in the number of women on the ballot there's also been a qualitative difference in how female candidates have marketed themselves so multiple women have shown themselves breastfeeding and their campaign abs they're showing their tattoos they're wearing jeans and t shirts and getting ultra sounds
and it seems like for a lot of candidates this year has sort of march and opportunity to stop pretending that they're just like any male candidate that the experience of living as a woman is sort of incidental to their qualifications for political office and they're making it more of a part of their affirmative argument for themselves
celeste you've been following a lot of these races which candidates have stood out to you as far as self presentation is concerned there have been a lot of women that have done some innovative things like think really the idea that a lot of us have looked at is this idea of of authenticity
on the trail that as you say it's no longer have sort of a hindrance so to speak although obviously never should have been considered one but now it's not just okay to be a woman it's important to be a woman being a woman means maybe you've had experiences than men haven't had a war that you consider problems and away
that men don't consider them being a mom isn't something traditionally that voters have lacked questions about there's research that shows that female candidates are questioned by voters as to whether they can quote handle the rigors of public life while taking care of their families
now you see a lot of women out there as you say breastfeeding but also talking about being a mom and being a family person as as a qualification as an experience and that that is something that's been really prominent in this race i've not every candidate who does this wins we had one can in new york zephyr teacher
who's running for state attorney general
who was pregnant during the campaign in the primaries she had an ad where she was undergoing a sonogram you could literally hear the baby's heartbeat
while she's talking about how awesome should be at this office was something i don't believe i had seen in any of the eighty five thousand campaigns are covered before this
can i can i just way you can i just you use the word authentic it's so interesting that stuck out to me because i to me it felt it feels perform at it like when you and i love it i'm not saying perform and of in a bad way but it but to me what's like intoxicating when you sit down and watch these videos is that they're like performing motherhood on the ads it's like
so in your face it's not the way like the mail campaign ads just have they're like family around i have a family they're like in your face with my breast feeding and my ultrasound it's like very pro formative i wouldn't say femininity just like female nurse and away which feels very bad ass to me yeah
i hesitate to use the word gimmicky but that was the first word that sort of popped in my mind when i watched the the two candidates who are breastfeeding in their abs are both of them lost their primaries but one was running for maryland governor the other was running for governor of wisconsin and the fact that both of them are breastfeeding in there
it seemed slightly awkward like they were trying to make it seem like oh this wasn't planned and i just had to breastfeed at this exact moment a may commercial had to be films like we couldn't have time around a baby's hand schedule
and it was clear to me that they have probably thought a lot about this because if you're not that they were actually showing their breasts but if you're sharing this intimate moment with your baby on camera like clearly you've planned it
with zephyr teach out in when i don't think i've even seen a political candidates belly button before like much less watching them get a medical procedure in a doctor's office and so i agree with you on i was kind of shocking to me and yeah i don't think i got the authenticity vibe that i did get the i am trying to be authentic
yeah i got the state the state run part of it is really clear and if there's an on time for folks who make a statement i guess pokes are like this is it this is my time to show my boob on camera
but you know i did have this moment when you know
certainly the fact that there has to be such a dramatic
display is i think in some ways a little bit of a backlash against like i need to show up as gender neutral as possible which historically a lot of women have done down to how they dress and how they don't talk about their family or a family responsibilities because of the fear that it might seem that
just like when you walk into a job a job
you don't start you don't start off by saying so i have five kids and i'm expecting another one and is this conversation about whether that's even okay for people to ask so there is very much still this very strong and any i think most workplaces
yeah i would say most workplaces where this idea of motherhood
we call the motherhood penalty were whether it's getting a job keeping wages running for office
this is this is really the the the the contrast to that is so stark and i think it's important that it's so stark because the penalty has paid so much everyday okay validity for did it freak you out like actually watching them because like i was really scared like the penalty is real like the cultural visceral step
rio types are real like i actually was like i i my mind was racing when i watched his ads because i felt like i was like do it don't do it do it don't do it
i just couldn't like did you watch them as somebody who has actually been through this did you watch them and think like yeah at an early and also so many who you know just lake throwing my hat in the ring for local politics and thinking in that like i was like i would there was there is absolutely something that i would never do nor would i advise someone to do
what's that one man or breast feed my evident
just keep it does some level like i'm also one of these people think very private and just seems like a very intimate private moment and
over sharing culture is one of those things where i just like you know even like i have i have family members relic don't take pictures of your bare belly when you're pregnant that's crazy
it is definitely like this this foundation that i have for my upbringing
marla steep
when it comes to you know bodies and even putting your kids out there that's the other piece of it that i was kind of shocked about to buy are absolutely i was laid new because now you're going to be like the breastfeeding canada and that's all i can never talk about breastfeeding candidate what remember talking about right now maybe
maybe that's the point though i mean the fact is we are talking about it if you think about all the candidates that were out there that were sort of
you might think of them in their in their eighty's power suits not trying to show that they're just one of the guys not breastfeeding way that would be i didn't see anybody breastfeeding and then eighties power not only not resonating but not having breasts like our roadways cover now yeah
it's just
the fact is it is getting attention and a lot of people got a lot of attention through these ads that they might not have gotten and of course that's just one part of the story but i think people sort of also at least observations if this was a year to do it this was going to be the year the susquehanna why the time to turn the tables well because
because women have been so much at the forefront of politics
in terms of in terms of the me to move in in terms of just a backlash to donald trump to sort of translating the passion and the intensity of the women's march into action
walking with a sign for a lot of people wasn't enough to to to express or to to take action on how they felt about a lot of stuff the trump administration was doing and that was way before brett catalog got involved in the picture so i think very much being forward and out there about being a woman guess sometimes
look i mean by the third add
doug just being like breastfeeding or being basically like hey ladies
that kind of thing maybe it starts to look a little road but there were people willing to take that chance especially in these crowded primaries were you gonna stand out from the crowd or know you're just you're wasting your time and also slashed euro in a piece about women candidates that if women don't confront questions
about having kids and balancing their life at home with their life in public they will take a hit with voters and so i wonder if some of these women by coming out and saying like look i am a woman i'm a mom years of my life looks like i'm not going to pretend that i'm not at home like surrounded by primary
children's toys all the times and like a burp cloths on my shoulder that they're trying to get out ahead of some criticisms that they might face stereotypes that might be projected onto them yeah i think that there is a reality there for women candidates of those questions with voters are different than from
men men featuring you know they're loving wife and family in their commercials all the time and it's never like cod how's he going to make it work being a dad being a public
us large you know so you don't you don't get that dynamic but with women some people are like but what about the children
it's really not fair so you do have do you do have to talk about that
there was a big case even
in this cycle with a woman who running for congress out on long island in new york who convinced the f si to let her use some of the money that she raised in donations for childcare
that was kind of a big deal so does the fact that took this long but it's twenty eighteen people had kids before this midterm cycle and the fact that this is just coming up now's is to me kind of amazing
thing i wouldn't say is that i think that
to the folks that are saying at least on the side there has to be a change in the playbook because we're losing our message were not reaching people or maybe both parties are having that problems said the other point i think is important is that in addition to standing out it's like how do i really to voters and how do i get people out and then term how do i really in a way that
is outside the party norms and this is one way that people have reached out outside the norms and cases where women are running without endorsement of the national party or without the coffers and financial backing
and there is the sense that you know we have to change and not be the everyone no one wants to be the establishment right now
because because that's the losing message for for every town america so i think that
you know i think that is another piece of it is like how can i
dissociate myself from the political establishment and the expected canada because you know whether which side you're on we're losing with with that with that paradigm so can we just spin out like best possible scenario of this wave of ads now we're just talking imagery here we're not talking about who's going to
when right yeah like best possible scenario of all these ads and like worst possible scenario like best possible scenario is we change the language around political presentation we make it more real we allow women to be themselves it's kind of authenticity like it leads to authenticity eventually because women can be
more honest about like the reality is they face and what their life is like like they can they can handle it
so there isn't this kind of and spoke in question around whether women are able to do power and children at the same time o m g
what's the worst possible scenario
i think it's exactly the stuff that you describe think it's people have people have a reaction to women have a bad reaction to it they get sort of
cheap i hate to use that word but it's sort of like let me let me explain my adorable baby to get you to vote for me because i really want to go to congress or i really want to be mayor or i really want something i want something from you and i am using my personal story to to target your heart strings and to get it which is
kind of the lot of what people do all along other than the other options are you the reader resume or talk about
how bad the other guy is chump you what a champion now you should ever have a forum where i mean like spin it out even further so like that's what happens in this and so therefore what happens for women in politics so like let's say people think it's cheap trick or they just not buying it for some reason and then what would respect a score of zero or women or people
i think i say read some of the youtube comments on our one of these campaign videos with breastfeeding candidate it was maryland gubernatorial candidate crush the garage
and i should never read the comments i know that and i usually never read the comments but i'm like i don't know what the people are saying about this video and the two people were saying things like just because you show your tedious on t v doesn't mean you can be governor
in meanwhile you know her breast was not exposed i think it's very important that we make that clear but they called her and entitled them though they said you know hillary tried to do the whole woman thing and and failed because i thought was hilarious
as if you know just by being a woman running your like doing the woman to woman thing
someone else transcribe the ad and replace the word woman with the j j
so i think and not at do that
gotta ride in iran
there
i think we are
probably none of these new to come enters will vote probably a lot of them don't even live in the us i was guessing based on the way they were spelling some of their words but i do think that if if i took that as like the pulse of the public i think the of the worst possible scenario of the public i would say that people will look at video
like this that sort of forefront the things that people usually say make women look weak and
project those things on to all women candidates to say that you know women are just like breast feeders they're just people who get sonograms all the time only mom's you know and even a woman who doesn't have kids is like i'm thinking of her through the lens of this other candidate who i think showed her quote unquote teddy's on tv yeah
and i think that the the broader question about whether we can use identity or at least some identity as an asset in politics is still a lot of people's minds especially following the two thousand and sixteen presidential election where it was like we can we can't we can we should but at the end of the day
it's the identity or the gender of the being the woman itself that is so hard for people to get around as opposed to i'm in canada and i'm really qualified and that's why you should believe me even if you don't think women should be or which is kind of sucks and cynical but for those people who are already having a hard time with women in power
power this meeting you where you are in my pants suit or my collared shirts
i think alienates those people that you know maybe it's as much smaller slice of the american electorate but there's definitely this folks who kind of squirming around and have never seen locally even a woman and you know and any power and also that this goes the other direction and
pantsuits will make a comeback now i want to talk about two female candidates who had ads that sort of went viral and they were adds that tried to make them look extremely strong and i would say traditionally masculine these are two women who were in the armed forces
and jay hagar who's running for congress in texas
she had i want say one of the most viral videos viral campaign videos of all time especially fair candid who was you know
had no history and political office
and i think we can probably listen to a clip of it
but my story begins much earlier one of my first memories was on her door and it was my dad during my mom threw a glass
three years later mom got the courage to walk out the she opened a new one for my sister and me here in taxes
it was here that that my foot on the gas and follow my dream to be a pilot
and that meant pushing sometimes kicking through every that was it my way
c n knew you know she shows herself not only caring for her kids and playing with toys with them but also she talks about when she got shut down piloting a helicopter in afghanistan and there's this one line where she's like
you know i i strapped to myself to the skids and returned fire on the taliban
like oh my god i love that ads and then later then again i mean she is lay back and home
and the other candidate was a make graphs she's running for congress in kentucky she's also a pilot
in the marines but both of these women not only did they talk about their military service they talked about lobbying to get women into combat roles in the military and the men who shut them down and i thought showing that sort of like female power in the face of men who didn't want them to have power was extreme
powerful and possibly
a way forward for women who are wanting to show like that they are both women am strong i thought that there was a great parallel with that with those two messages with the current climate right now which is very much like i survived it's like the survivor as opposed to the sort of like i'm a woman so that's ok i think that the message especially in
the political and social discourse around
assault and other things that are coming to light his the survivor story and i felt like there are various survivor some tricks someone even talked about history of growing up and so the sense of like i'm a survivor
and bringing the story comes along with that skill like you know the story sounds just like i'm a person and i'm very i'm like you but like i'm using the story to sort of show a shrink that i can bring to the opposition very different
easily than what we just talked about on the on the breastfeeding
so i was very moved by these innocent like women in combat generally is is extremely exciting to me
yeah i gotta say listeners all of you should go out and watch the sad if you haven't seen it it's on youtube it's everywhere you can find it it is so genuinely moving i mean that's what you just said like it's a survivor thing but to me what was perfect about it was the tone like it didn't turn was extremely practical you know and i mean it was like i did this and i was flying the
plain and and this happen and then the kids came and then this happen and then i went knocked on doors couldn't do it did something else it's like it's like it's like you really have to read the survivor thing between the lines because there's so much action in it and the doors trip is really really good and so you just like you trust this person like you trust this person to feel things but have everything
under control like it as such a good political ad it's amazing the empty a hater ad was was very very effective for a lot of the reasons that everybody here is talking about they get it is exciting is exciting to talk about this woman being in the military and having this experience at arena earning a purple heart
but at the same time there is a narrative that runs through the idea that that her experience and the pitch for the scan it can be summed up
in this idea of doors of a passing through doors of going you're entering door knocking kicking in doors is is very effective and i really got people's attention and it wasn't so much necessarily about like hey i'm a woman but i'm a woman who did this who lived through that who will do this for you
it came off as it did come up as perhaps is forced and the doctor didn't come off apparently from what i'm hearing from over the years it didn't come off as a key which which i think kind of kind of important near now oh my gosh site blown up in a helicopter like it's definitely not achy and there's definitely this this i have less of an idea
of what the sort of anti feminists are this the folks who are like you know the gratuitous ads mean nothing
criticism than a lot of women are getting and sort of like you need a real platform if you're going to be in office this is not real even if you have one all they see as you know your brass so i think this is this is very different to and the solicitation of responses from the naysayers who say you know tell us about what you're going to do not about who you are which is ridiculous and
politics because it should be about who you are but if you're going to be yeah it's an opportunistic argument to say like you know i think that this person doesn't have a real platform which i mean this is the way ads work so i think it has a much better staying power
as a strategy yeah i mean and i was trying to think whether it's a replica ball strategy for other candidates who maybe haven't been shot down in a helicopter and returned fire on the taliban and you know was one of the people who got the pentagon to change their policy about allowing women in combat roles
but i think the way like you said the teeth or she
she takes her personal narrative and her identity and translate that into how she would actually lead and and our next segment will actually talk about how identity does or does not in for how people lead i think that's the thing that could possibly capture voters attention more than just that even if you haven't had all of
these experiences use of domestic violence and anybody can sort of take their own background and make a story like this is just an incredibly good set of communication skills but she and her advisers have i do wonder though if there's a way to tell the story like a lot of the research that shows that women tend to be
the more or overqualified and don't think of themselves as is ready for office of the women that we dad or lake you know way overqualified not necessarily for the job compared to men
and a lot of cases and i wonder in part of the thing there is how many things that one potentially has to overcome it less less paths laid out for women and i guess there's less of a legacy assumption and you have to make your case and i do think there's possibly a way to translate that into a message so it isn't like you you got shot down and
a plane but you could say like the path here was not easy which i think would distinguish for many women themselves from from the male candidates at some level you want people to think you have money and backers and you don't want people to know that you're not raising money but the same time there's a message in like you know i decided to do this and
go to make it to this point without x y and z and that could be a way to answer a question are there any other candidates or abs
yeah i'll have that sort out here well there's that haiti high camp armrests line one
very funny yeah so highly healthcare is a senator democratic senator in a very very tough race in north dakota and she put out an ad shows her sitting at a table arm wrestling with this guy twice her size were in a muscle shirt as she used to
talking to the camera as their as they're going at it there but she say that it's a baby
is how we should decide elections and her premise of course is that that will be a ridiculous way to decide elections but it's an attack at it is it is going after her opponent but the idea of a woman arm wrestling in a political commercial again
yeah they covered a lot of these not something i remember seeing to too often
in terms of advertising but the against the point that we've gotten to did this level says a lot of things about this campaign he talks about the different strategies the fact that you could be a little bit more blood she's not actually saying she can have a beat up physically beat up the other guy but
there's this sort of feet of male female component there and also with it's just it was his eye catching something you look at your like but the hell is going on here
and at the end she does beat him and she says something to her opponent like kevin i'm just getting warmed up it's a little bit of the threat
so yeah i think that the person watching that video is think like wow haiti hate can like so strong sober asshole
so manly well everything i wanted to quickly mention we've been talking about women
raise and using issues of the day related specifically to women in their ads
you know specifically around things like sexual assault and domestic violence and being survivors and i were as we would not necessarily have seen that in the past her past election cycles but the other thing we're seeing his men doing the same using this opportunity to appeal to the elusive the women
voters that everyone's been talking about are the ones to to appeal to right now because of the loss of of women voters and their tracks of all these following politicians and other folks who have been accused of misdeeds
the interesting part of a right now is accurate a part mentioning you know andrew promos mention of of sexual assault or in his ads and in some cases it's very clear that the men are just like sort of taking a box and and other cases you may not know how they feel one way or the other and others it's very clear
that it's totally opportunistic and totally not on that authentic taken all and
my question when i see those was that really working do people really believe now that you know this guy is really super excited about his ability to get into office and actually do something about sexual song we see that there's history that bears that some cases is a very is a lot of doubt yeah that that's the case
leave it there then listeners let us know what you think about the ads that forefront the woman nets and the mother heard of the candidates

our next topic today do women make a difference if all the women who won their congressional primaries end up winning their general elections which it's not going to happen a lot of them are running against republicans and very conservative districts would that leadership meaningfully differ from any other debt
crab majority congress
i have a tough time with his question sometimes because i know that there's a ton of studies that show that women do pursue different policy priorities and office
but a lot of that has to do with the fact that so few women in office are republicans and so to insist on that there's some sort of essential difference between like a progressive woman and and progressive man feels a little uncomfortable to me
hannah what do you think you know i think it's like you're right it's completely theoretical which is pathetic that it's complete theoretical like the best studies that i've or the best test case for me that i read about this is the women on norwegian board like when norway passed a law say
met a certain percentage of their corporate boards had to be female and then served track to that are some somebody track that and saw whether it made a difference in decision making and the one difference in decision making that they pointed out was not so much that like women were more empathetic or that they focused on a different set of issues but that they weren't as
reactive which actually made a difference so when there was a recession for example they didn't instantly fire people like they weren't super focused on the bottom line they had kind of a long view so that's a form of empathy like let's let's look at the long term and see things play out over time
so i don't really know how to translate that to politics like i'm i'm often torn between thinking well is the right future were hoping for a future in which women can be anything like is that what we want or do we want we just want women to be progressive and like
everyone should be stacey abrams i think everyone should have
she is amazing everyone should be i want to be stays abrams i'm just saying like in my mind i'm not sure what is ideal for the world to get there's no question that the idea that somebody has to scrap and get to the top of whatever political branch they get to i can't dissociate that i think there's there's a
story there there's a paving the way potentially for other women even if it's with a set of more conservative view points i know that's a little
controversial but i think that we're so divided on partisan lines these days that i can't even tell sometimes who's a feminist and who's not a feminist and i think because we associate so many progressive policies that benefit women with the parties we kind of a lot of a candidates off the hook or a lot of the elected officials on both sides after hooked as i mean there are a lot of progress
and i'm not one hundred percent sure women or men that they're feminists per se because they support tick the box or her choice and are wide i'm good
but that doesn't mean that they're not you know is not they're not things going on in their offices are they're not like perpetuating misogyny and some other way which as we know has come up with some democratic lawmakers who were
who sort of like faded into the black because of being accused of harassment on i saw so i don't know i i i personally think that
it's a it's about what happened in our everyday lives and like thinking of feminism and whether or not something is good for women on partisan lines is extremely difficult for me speaking of partisanship i think it's important to remember i mean i've seen a lot of
over research that would suggest that partisanship is more important than gender in the end whether you're a democrat or republican is going to be more important perhaps in the decision making process or and how you though them whether you're a man or woman
c
studies that show that women are perceived as more trustworthy
you also see indications that women may be more collaborative and more into team work outside of government but once you get into once you get into the matrix so to speak you know how much does that change i think a lot of people find it is it is different then then in the real world
real real world us capital may be different than you know real world like successful business
when i think about women who are republicans and whether i should be excited for them to succeed i mean this this wave of women we've seen running for office is absolutely limited to the democratic party
there are no more republican women running now than there were ten years ago and republican women have trouble now because they have to kind of walk this line that's very difficult to walk yeah this particular moment trump whatever it's really hard at this particular moment for a republican women to run rate and i almost think this is
doubly anti feminism he in some way but i think that it's almost worse when conservative woman six years then when
any normal like bad republican man succeeds because they're able to funnel their arguments against gender equality and against feminism through a woman's perspective so when they say something like oh yeah you know christine lousy ford is lying and women my about sexual assault than men can point to them and say like oh well look
look what women are saying and people can feel better about subscribing to that view or or parenting that perspective because a woman has said it
i think about people like sarah palin who really did forefront her mother heard in her campaign
for vice president and the way people use their mom status to justify racism and xenophobia like keeping their kids safe from m s thirteen and when you hear politicians talk about trans people in bathrooms it's always invoking this idea of like a little daughter being accosted by a man
man in the bathroom i feel like there are ways that people can use their womanhood and their mother heard
to harm people in ways that like any old man can't because they're easier to brush off as well that's a man talking
woof that's a really hard one because you're absolutely right you're like one hundred percent ray maybe it's just and faces like it's sort of one eventually like seventy years from now for it to be possible for women to occupy lots of difference a slight there is interest one way to be a woman
yeah all i don't super damaging like right now what you're saying a super damaging like at this particular moment
now i will say that i think being a woman does matter when we're talking about reproductive rights even even within progressives and the pro choice community
i was reading an article recently about australia in the state of queensland they the parliament just voted to legalize abortion which had been banned since eighty ninety nine and people have been crediting that shift with more women coming into political office and i remember when hillary clinton ran for president and she talked about
abortion during one of today's she had a little known trump it felt different to me and i would actually be curious to hear from man if any of our mail listeners want to raid and how men interpreted that because to me it felt completely different from even when extremely progressive men talk about abortion rates because for her it felt
real it felt like the stakes were personal and wasn't just like oh this is a political issue that i feel passionate about this is about like women's bodies in flesh and blood and something that i can intimately understand for me that showed like there's a difference between just voting the right way and being a leader on certain issues and i think from that perspective women's leadership
ship can matter a lot and we've seen that also in the way that i honor presley
ousted an extremely progressive congressmen in her primary she's almost certainly going to be the next congressman from her district in massachusetts she said in her campaign you know i probably won't vote much differently
from the sky that i'm running against but i will lead differently and pretty sure she's her district is like the only majority people of color district in massachusetts she's a black woman and his white and so she was like it makes a difference that i am representing this district and even though we might have similar views on things my leadership will be deferred
then again who are we kidding of course it's going to be different like to think of stacey abrams doesn't isn't is elected governor
it won't be different i will be amazing
and it will just be amazing to watch like these and particularly at this moment because the women who are running or energized to a particular way and if enough of them when will have models of leadership to work differently and will be driven by identity yeah and i think that i was just reading something about terrorism and how for for multiple reasons she is problematic for
a lot of people but she's one of these women in power who made a point of saying it's important for women to be in power and i'm committed to make to making sure moment and aren't power as a societal exercise different from one her policy agenda is which is as i said problematic croats of people
and i think that whether or not whenever a side you're on this idea that we're sort of even hemmed in to like this limited scope of of hot button political issues is part of the problem you know it's the fact that you know he's got the party who supports abortion rights and the party who does
don't and fundamentally
you could have and you do have but there are hard to get around with talk about it there's a lot we've always thought that there's a lot more republicans and quote unquote you know conservatives who are pro choice but they don't campaign on that issue they don't come out they don't vote pro choice because of the partisan divide and i think that is what's
clouding a lot of this as well as that you've gotta do certain things you just can't speak against which for a lot of feminists are just like if you're if you're sure enough for this there's no way you can support women and be a feminist
and to some extent it's almost like how you lead and you know and how you how you talk about women's you know it
advancement in society as much more important and can you do both can you talk about women's advancement and not be purchase that's the question
i just i was just the one thing about in regard to to sort of these contrast that we're seeing between the newer women candidates and the older men candidates are more traditional can the example of receded to live in michigan really interests me i mean there you have john conyers
who was
a veteran veteran lawmaker i think was there for over fifty years and left office after a bunch of sexual misconduct allegations and now you have a woman replacing him i don't know if that's going to be kind of a moment for pupils people are going to look at that that sort of changing of the guard she has no
republican opponent on the ballot in november so it looks like she's she's pretty well on her way to washington but the idea of of that person that exchange know that succession is i don't know kind of powerful to me it's it's kind of a moment i think in in american
politics as part of something bigger the that we're talking about now
listeners
excited to hear your thoughts
i'm whether whether one room think different once they get into office and how and also i yeah if you're a man and you saw hillary clinton talk about abortion tell me what he thought of that the waves that's the dot com is our email address this episode is brought to you by career builder

we're going to have like flying cars and also a woman president
future is so much brighter in hollywood
the jets
yeah like to it's like a stay at home mom who depended on the robot i know but i'm thinking like the the idea of a woman as for example president or vice president is like is the thing that has never happened in real life for us but all of those things have happened like you know we're going to have a robot he's going to cook all of our meals
before we're going to have a woman in the white house
that's not true but i do think that that watching women in office on tv and in movies is like a little bit of wish fulfillment also a little bit of like projecting our worst fears about what women in power will do
so they think it's not totally off topic as we talk about this landmark election
in terms of women's representation
god willing to talk about what these female politicians and the culture tell us about what we want and what we don't want
i'm going to turn it over to you first wow do you have for us
i have a couple so claire underwood from house of cards him who sends you know as a result perhaps of her making and the combination of her husband some minds but it's all very
cloak and dagger
i think that it was a very interesting time for that character to to rise as this very shrewd smart
and then sending by my husband who's the president announced the united states since would of you know sort of waiting for my time and then and very much having her own agenda and that's very very clear and as opposed to sort of waiting for her time to sort of like jump into the machine i think that the contrasts with this character is that lake
very much is an operative than her own rate and has a very very specific set of things that she wants to happen and do that
that despite how like grim and like scary that show in some way some ways it was just amazing to watch her i just loved that character so much for so many reasons and she was also very staid and very very elegant i have to say that i'm sure it was intentional but she was just very poised
despite all of that am being shrewd and that that that doesn't always come together usually like shrewd it's like raging reaching feminist but she was shrewd and respected and also very
just very well put together and very lake com the other i have to throw julie resurface into the mix for the oh yeah you her feet down for so many reasons and though while the description of her character has been like this is like narcissistic unqualified like cursing
you know woman who's who's who's of the vice president who wants to be president doesn't sound too far off from a lot of be said
this idea that this is such a far gone idea that you would have someone with such a personality is what on the one hand on the other hand i think this show does a really good job despite the fact that she comes across as a buffoon and a lot of ways
there's a lot of cutting moments where she talks about
how difficult it is for her as a woman she talks about you know she refers to
the reason she curses so much as because she had to survive in her early days she talks about that
one favorite favorite scene i have is when she said and finland and one of her nemesis is the prime minister of feminine she's there and like she's giving her gift and her husband the prime minister has been groups selena meyer and there's this conversation in the hotel after the incident happens and she's talking to her aides
one for women aged says well you have to say something you have to talk about this as she says i can't be the woman i'm going to just be no no one's going to make a statue out of me because i got groped by the prime minister was has been kind of a ways out to her aid why she can't come out about being groped by the prime minister's husband because she would be known that would be her like a
and she's like i can't talk about being assaulted and she's and she's lying on a bad smoking which only does on international trips and it was just perfect moment her male advisers are standing and she looks at her eight her women aid who was very confused and like you really have to come out she's not coming out and she's like that's because we live in a man's world as she takes a puff of smoke and she turns to her
and she says
the axis of dick and it was just like the most perfect moment of her basically being like yes this is crazy but the end of the day politics is a man's world and i can't talk about my sexual assault
this is like a few years ago but i thought that that the show does have these moments of really like laying out what it's like my celeste
do you have ironically the exact same to care curse
i literally do it i think it's it's incredible the contrast between the two of them between between the character and house of cards and the character in the is is what's so appealing to me
in in house of cards and the claire underwood character you do have this sort of i would go beyond poised frankly i go to to should have cold as sort of having exceptionally perfect the near least in public have always you know never never a hair out of place never a
a wrong word
everything so exceptionally exceptionally calculated now
a woman who's obviously risen to extreme power
and it's it's exciting and interesting to see how she exercises it but the idea of how she gets there is completely treacherous completely cold hearted her her marriage has become essentially a put on it's it's a fronts until it ceases to exist
so the idea of her being still being a sort of
engaging character from an emotional standpoint does have a real life she does have an emotional life it's just not necessarily with her husband
that to me is very interesting now
other hand you do have this sort of the silliness and the sort of the goofy character the jury julia louis dreyfus character but at the same time i think she's much more much more reliable than the claire underwood character because who
people could fantasize about being in this this plot twist the world of house of cards i think the veep character is more like like dang i spilled coffee on a shirt again
i have this really important thing to to go to have a really important meeting i've got to do a really good job and his presentation this is this has gotta go down perfectly and i i i trip they slip died whatever
i think that you have these two characters that both have power in their own ways
i'm still somewhat reliant on men still try to deal with man or
you succeed despite and then but both both approachable in to varying degrees but still fun to watch and a way to get people into politics that might not be which i am i prove that message i would love somebody to get into politics he was inspired by claire and
their word
to avatar way to the time
i also like the way they handled her abortion where it was like started out as something that she wanted to hide but then she kind of turned it into something that
like a like a plus for her something that she used to galvanize mum in and i am curious to see whether that will ever happen in future elections seasons weather like the breast feeding commercial or turn into the i had an abortion commercial on
hannah
i had enough and free on american television i hate all the representations of lady politicians on american television wow never strike me as real their total fantasy is there are either parodies or kind of fantasy is a sexy power or just kind of liberal bullshit fantasy is were like a woman gets elected president and like fixes the and
firemen and it's just it's all wrong to me and so all i got for you is bargain and beer gut nyberg which is that danish t v
there is a tv series called for again b o r g and danish political drama it is unbelievably great it was hugely popular in the u k for a while and i've watched every episode of that there are three seasons and she's like a minor politician who becomes the first female prime minister of denmark and and the other main character in
it is this reporter katrina farms mark she is like the tv one news anchor and they're such a natural grappling of the kinds of issues that women would realistically face like a woman would realistically face like there's the abortion and but it doesn't go down like the way it does in america where it's like m
obvious child she had an immersion it was no big deal like fuck you it's two thousand and eighteen you know it just you like watch bargain and you're like at his two thousand and eighteen like this is actually how it would happen these are the issue late she would deal with i feel like abortions and american tv is usually like a tragedy and and such a difficult decision it's either a try
tragedy in a difficult decision or it's not and then we have to write fifty thousand articles about like oh my god it's not a tragedy that so radical that they portrayed it as not a tragedy thank you
so anyway and bargain it's just like she has a husband her husband cheats on her they end up getting into force that site what happens when you get a divorce and your the prime minister it's not so by operatic it just goes down and this realistic way now i'm a realist so i prefer my dramas that way i totally love both like i watch veep like i love that is so funny like there
hundreds of feet by watched over and over again but it does nothing for me in terms of like the real real like what would this like getting my head around what it would actually be like only bargain does that for me so i know you're laughing at me that a really good show it's a really really good show and mostly i think we're org
in but i i wouldn't tell you i would go even further and talk about the woman who play beer good who whenever she's interviewed is the most funny like like just wise things about women in power and about her own language but i just cannot proud surname so i am not going i talk to you about her but if you just called poor
in and beer
her name is since the babbitt knudsen i don't know listeners just laugh at me and then displayed right and or send us a little like like voice memo about how to actually pronounce all these names but but anyway it's it's the best not always
best yeah
i am going to was so that that nobody already took this melli grand on scandal do you have any scandal fans and
wow wow nobody not even danielle i'd watch that shit that falls as hard in my box of whack fan
i like it i watch it it's totally intoxicating but yeah that thing for me i mean there's nothing realistic about this the portrayal of anything in scandal it's all like incredibly like soap opera and nothing would ever it's like the drama compounds
season by season so that by season five year like i now there's like eight hundred back stories you have to deal with and everything just gets more and more bizarre but melli grant is a pro choice republican she started out as i don't want to say a senator
is also actually starts out as the first lady becomes a seminary
and she does this sort of wendy davis style lake filibuster to defend women's health care at one point and that rockets her into the onto the national stage as an actual politician and not just the first lady
but then by the time she becomes present in her and her husband are divorced him so she's not only for the first woman president but she's single and i kind of think that the most radical thing that scandal portrayed boatman her husband was president and then when many grant is president the depiction of a single president and how they're dating
and how the secret service has to like bring their one night stands to and from their bedroom
but then there's this one plot point in the season were malley as president where the head of state of this fuck him
middle eastern country called bash ron
gaps they they have like a romantic entanglement and it kind of paternal tapes that with foreign policy because he gets ousted in a queue and she has to decide whether to go to war with this country to reinstate him and then he ends up getting killed by her aides because she got too close to him and they fell he goes clouding
our foreign policy decisions so that to me was like the ultimate look what will happen if we put a woman in the oval office late her emotions will get in the way and will end up going to war with the country just because they have a really handsome prime minister
i kind of loved it though i also like the idea that we could elect a single president that it doesn't have to be like some thing is wrong with somebody if they don't have a wife for or if they haven't had if they don't have a partner who's willing to stand beside them
hey man i just say amen to her listeners please tell us your favorite women in politics on t v say to hear from you

let's do our recommendations on out why don't you go first
i actually okay so i actually watched this couple weeks ago it was really the best thing i've seen by lake in years it's that movie minding the gap by being blue about skate skate that has friends who are skate boarders but it's about american masculinity
it's a documentary that he filmed over years and years he's like twenty eight or something and he's just been keeping a camera out with his friends it's an interrogation of his mother and male violence
and it is just stunningly beautiful and really like the best thing i've seen and forever it was on h b o for while i hope it still is but it's called minding the gap
and it's just it's fabulous that's fabulous sounds really going to less how about you i would definitely recommend that people check out the glamour women of the year some it that's coming up november ten november eleven there are a whole bunch of things to to see and do they going to be speakers they're going to be what you call experiences
this all leads up to our our big award ceremony where we honor women who are are important in a number of different walks of life it could be politics it could be entertained with it could be business so glamour women of the year some definitely check it out
and when that is november tenth and november eleventh grade after the election
latino of this leak
so this week and it's not a new show
know that they have made it more available if you don't have that blacks i think thinking didn't watch it on some local stations so this is happy valley
which i absolutely love british tv which are also absolutely love and the reason that i love the show i love british crime drama generally but
there's multiple things that it has going for it including the fact that the main character whose i think the it's a small town she's more like a small town chief of police but she's got a lot the weight of the rather her shoulder she's raising her grandson
because her her daughter was killed by her boyfriend who then goes to prison and then she has to like battle the boyfriend coming out and wanting wanting to access the child her sister lives with her who's a recovering alcoholic she herself a single and has has a lot of
young people looking up to her work and so it's like she you just want her to thrive and she's a bad ass and she's got all the stuff happening in her house and and she goes and sort of like fight crime in the streets and it has a small town feel it's not like urban gritty
there's a little bit of pretty nuts and it's a little dark in terms of some of the cases
but it's just go thing about the show which is a lot of british shows that i like in the genre is that it also features a middle aged woman as the main character which is also always very refreshing and you want to root for her she's got power and scale lot of power and it's very believable and it's just a great way to
just unplug and
if you need someone to root for he need to
his featuring middle aged women and lead roles of british thing i guess i mean maybe it's just the genre of lake crime dramas and mysteries that i liked by by far i can think of only a couple of us shows that i like or watchword of features middle age women are now you just me make middle aged women
real women they're not they're not they're about robin raid on how some there
just being able those sort of see the every woman and a professional and their job i feel like that so much more of a british saying that it is something that i see here which is one of the reasons that i'm drawn in addition to having like really strong female characters in law enforcement spaces that sounds really good i'm going to recommend a show that's been out for a while but i'm always
late two things
the marvelous misses me his own son amazon prime
everyone of in time me to watch it i was worried it would be really corny it is and i don't hate it
if you listen it's pod guess you probably know that i've been in the mood for some escape is in recent months and this show it's not pure escapism most definitely some serious storylines the it's about a woman in the late fifties
it's to her life is sort of thrown into turmoil and her husband leaves her and she's been to delete this perfect housewife
and then she decides to go into comedy which her husband did and and was just and very unsuccessful at that she has a real knack for it
it has kind of this like a starry eyed view of comedy and like you do it because in that it even know it ruins your life which i find a little bit dubious at this moment in history knowing what we know about how he felt comedians are treated but it is incredibly funny i actually have laughed out loud several times while watching it
which i don't usually do when i'm watching tv
and there's also a great one of the lead characters is this bush woman named suzy who is awesome and i'm so happy to see masculine and center woman get such great character treatment in the show actually my partner and i are dressing up as suzy and nudge the main characters karen we
at a party with during this weekend there's just so many gay characters in the show rachel browsing and it's fantastic in the lead role and i highly recommend it i have like blown through the first season and i'm waiting for the second one it's so it's gotten so many great reviews and then i see yeah i'm like that's not something i think
it seems very camp
it's really more than that and i think so my partner is the one who has like you need to watch the show and i'm like i'll watch the first episode you and then we'll say i think it had to do the font that that the title one's then if sarah looks like the bewitched font
it's honestly a lot better than it seems he's driving really funny i highly recommend it you can stream and on amazon prime
that show for it today thank you so much to our production assistant alex bearish and our police aren't any hewitt and thank ether thank you thanks santa totally my pleasure and thank you so much our clients less really appreciate it was fun
right for hundreds and motif alliance less caps i'm christina clergy thanks for listening
