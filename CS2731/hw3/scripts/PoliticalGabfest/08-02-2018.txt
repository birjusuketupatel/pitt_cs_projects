the problem metaphor trial began this week and a virginia courthouse or perhaps you should say the first palmetto for trial began there will be at least two and who knows how many trials
of the man who is the napoleon of crime
this first man for trial concerns charges brought by special counsel muller of tax evasion and bank fraud
mahler charges that metaphor lied cheated juggled hid sixty million dollars paid to him
much of it by ukrainian oligarchs victor gonna coach mcguirk slash ukrainian president viktor yeah i'm kind of which and then committed fraud when that money dried up and twenty fourteen by line to banks about various fairly trivial matters matters involving a country to get loans and things like a metaphor is also scheduled to go on trial in september in d c and money
wandering charges so ruth none of the charges in this case are related to present trump to collusion into the campaign or collision so how do they connect to the larger miller investigation
well they connect and a couple of potential ways one is the potential though it seems like if that were going to happen it would have happened already have manner for it slipping and being providing evidence if he has any against tramp over
at least some information about what the president the or then candidate trump knew about his involvement or other involvements with russians for example matter for it was in the increasingly infamous trump tower meeting where are they dangle derek
the other way it could be potentially relevant is if it provide some insight into eventually and that could also be with matter for its cooperation or maybe we don't seem to be getting it in this trial maybe with the cooperation of rick game
who is alleged and now i'm guilty pleading partner in these crimes of fraud
adam davidson races this point in a very interesting piece in the new yorker which is there are two manner for its there is the man there's ostrich jacket manna for it who is just making in these eye popping sums of money and spending eye popping sums of money that you really can't even imagine like in supermarket sweep
steak some dating myself like if you were tasked with spending that much money will be really hard to do and then there is cash poor desperate for infusion of money man of for it who has somehow gone through these eye popping psalms in his resorting allegedly she carefully says to various forms of bank friday
in order to manage to continue to find his lavish lifestyle
and the question that adam raises which i think it's a really interesting question is so he's desperate enough to do these fundamentally stupid and discoverable things like lying to banks about the reasons for loans are lying about whether it's a rental property so he can extract money from the mortgage and this is
the very time he goes to work for the trump campaign unpaid and he is allowing the oligarchy is close to something like twenty million dollars and he's talking to his colleagues about how he can get right with the oligarchs and offering three things with the oligarchs so what did he
exactly offer in his desperation we don't have evidence that that seems to me to be an interesting question to answer your question so emily why
some ways to angeles but why a smaller able to bring charges like this if they are so on
on their face so disconnected from trump been could he could he charge could charge jeff sessions with jaywalking if you wanted to well i mean mahler's directive from the justice department as broad because it talked about russian interference nail action and all related matters and so as ruth explain the possible
not afford slipping on and then the idea that there was something that he might have had to broker so you know we haven't seen evidence of this yeah of our example the republican party's platform about the crane changed in a kind of unexpected way on before the election around the time of the republican convention and you could
imagine the special prosecutor trying to draw a line between these huge stats and office lot of spending and that decision
that's theoretical at this point but it's that kind of connection which we don't know of yeah but which could be on out there within the grasp and the potential grass of mahler's team that would bring listen to that all related batters sphere i don't know about jay walking by sasha is that sounds like it to be a much
hard or reach him but i mean like yeah
the theory about why even if muller sitting on information about metaphor
something unseemly with the term campaign is that he wouldn't want to tip his hand because he'd have to turn that material over to defense attorney to be is going to use it at all and the case against men rate from brady way any way that
oh yes thank you david other lessons are thinking and
yeah i mean there's something odd about this case in a sense that if it's all about something man for it then why as matter a i flipped is he waiting to see if he is actually found guilty and let the likely sentence will be is there some other reason we don't know that he doesn't want to flap or is afraid to flip on you know or just anything trump is going to pardon and so on
all those questions are swirling out there but in the mean time on yeah we can't necessarily see all the evidence and the fact that this trial is on there is a wall between this trial and all of russia allegations is useful to mahler it's also a wall that the judge in the child's in
for saying on family he has told the prosecution not to talk about russia and he also has told the defense not to make this all about the idea that matter for being persecuted so i think the idea is to have a straight up a straight up tile on the facts about the tax and bank fraud allegations and issue here
brits you present and early in your response my first question that metaphor has decided not to flip but it but just going to the point made isn't it
just as likely that metaphor manifests occasion to flip would be after guilty after and if he's he's found guilty and he's like i want to minimize the sense of flip then and then actually what he's doing is inviting the pardon so i find manner for it's legal strategy here
almost as puzzling as rudy giuliani is legal strategy here and trying to figure out which one makes less sense to me because tightening manner for it is man for it is shooting the moon
he shooting the moon in a number of ways
in order for him to have a terrific outcome which seems highly unlikely given ample documentary evidence against him he would have to first be acquitted in this trial and then be acquitted in the second trial that scheduled for september he could have chosen to put these to trial
together he chose not to because they they have to be separated because of complicated then you reasons of were crimes allegedly occurred and but he could have chosen to waive the venue as you know having gone to the basil on school of law
excellent to mention it free
i could have
that's want schools are featuring many professors basil on am and that that seems like a really hard thing to do if he thought his best thing was to flip and get the lowest possible sends you know actually korea lot of favor from with prosecutors are
good will with prosecutors by forcing them to take the case to trial quite the opposite of that yes good point professor and so so what to do in with that once they have a conviction they kind of have you buy this graph of your neck so that leaves the seems to me
pardon strategy which is what i mean i guess first will pardon al capone and then who will pardon pomona for nothing is out of the realm of possibility in pardon sheriff joe world by it
it seemed like a very risky strategy i know that consistency is like irrelevant here but i it is interesting
pardon strategy that chant name a torque all response as to minimize his connections with for right it's like i barely knew he hardly works for me which isn't really the thing that you saying before your about departments someone though again i realized that asking for consistency is
the fool's errand know you might i barely knew him he hardly worked for me that's why i have the freedom in trump brain to pardon him and he's being treated very unfairly see i'll i'll cook how how how how much worse his life is than al capone yeah you're right okay that lenses out my favorite and under noticed
tweet from yesterday by the way i'm which is the al capone comparison because paul man who by the way had been freed on bond and was under house arrest and living a perfectly under the circumstances adequate lifestyle new civil libertarian really caring about people being detained without due process
says hello separated children and parents president donald trump is talking about him being held in solitary confinement why is he being held in solitary confinement because a judge found that he had been trying to tamper with the witnesses against him
i feel really bad for him so the president seems more work took unusual
this week about them all our investigation and called on attorney jeff sessions to to shut it down then floors quickly insisted no no he was just there was just an opinion he wasn't actually trying to obstruct justice and and he's calling it a hoax and of course the usual which language
you that feel
what do you have any sense about whether he'd actually educated about this or why were the education my come from not really accepted the tile starting i think there's a lot going on beneath the surface that we can't see and the fact that this was the mole men trunk cross the line and publicly called on sessions to get rid of this pesky investigation
then suggested to me then i don't understand the whole context here because on its face the timing look strange there and just ban a star in the new york times about how mahler is looking at champs tweets and considering whether they're well then turn obstruction of justice on charge or scenario sell it just seemed like you know
awfully blatant on the other hand i think a lot of trumps public statements have gone in the direction of like i'm saying that's right out loud so there can't be anything wrong with it so i i i have a hypothesis so good
like to throw out that that trumps agitation and i thought they would use exactly the right word his recent agitation is not related to the manner try although he is actually putting bollinger on trial
or trying to but it's related to something else that we've gotten some glimmers of which is mahler has been once again seeking and trying to figure out how to obtain trumps testimony not only about collusion there is no collision but also about the possibility of obstruction of just
this and i am the i am making this up here by it i think that there is a point at which mahler is going to have to put up or shut up in terms of asking nicely and making the decision between asking nicely and then going away if he doesn't get what he wants or doing what prosecutors tend to do in these circumstances which is
issue subpoenas and maybe he has said in his latest offer which was reported the small last night or this morning about what how he would be willing to narrow the scope of questioning of the president and the methods of questioning the president maybe he is also suggested
there could be a subpoena in the works
i have a corollary of my hypothesis if i may which is also maybe the president and his team also know or suspect that having seen to russia related indictments from the special counsel that the next indictment is coming in that it could be a conspiracy indictment
that name's a lot of people who are americans this time who aren't just russians that does seem like the other shoe that's and about and drop since a vegan diet men of all russian conspiracy conspiracy us and we've been getting awfully close also to be collusion it was not a crime
argument i mean we're they're basically religion or giuliani essentially made that after michael cohen claimed to trump knew in advance and the trump tower meeting giuliani its responsibility been will trump didn't know about the meeting the meeting didn't occur because i was told by the people who weren't at the meeting that didn't occur that didn't happen but even if that meeting
had occurred so it's not a crime doesn't it's not it doesn't matter i mean this is just
most amount of chaff that's the sort of the previous previous answer is no longer valid is no longer operative way in iraq and if he has now and the chaff what mean i mean that the giuliani answer seems to be cohen there was no planning meeting for them
planning eyes
that meeting didn't occur and i know it didn't occur because i've talked to the people who worked at that meeting who said that it didn't occur i mean basically to he can't it's a non he's not making a sensible argument which is what i was trying to convey but but in any case at the root for giuliani be is it is even if there was a meeting
to plan the russian meeting even if present from new bedford so what which seems to be
this gets us to all the way to where we knew we were headed which is were colluding with the russians is not a crime
yes and never been a number of the commentators on the right and have been defending this idea show what so what if the dirt comes from a foreign government
no it's okay to take up ovaries are chart to take whatever you got from any source no matter what laws they broke to acquire it no matter how much you know other sensible people might think it's not so great to have tunes folks cyber hacking and order
to interfere with our elections i think we are like right up against that argument and it's going to be interesting to to watch that play out because it really raised deep questions i would say about patriotism and nationalism and are kind of
didn't chance then i think amazed to see us go this far to see some some conservatives called this far and they're willing to defend on chomp on these pounds but is that the case ruth that actually colluding to get information falsely obtained illegally obtained by a foreign government
it is not primo i don't know
no it is criminal and one or it it certainly can be criminal and exactly and it can be criminal because we've seen this in some of the earlier indictments it is it can be part of a conspiracy to defraud the united states of honest and fair election
if you are taking and it can be violations of campaign finance laws taking things of value not reporting things of value taking things of value from a foreign entity which is additionally prohibit and campaign finance laws there are any number of ways in which he
probably creative or law stretching prosecutor can go after this
the would because for this reason it's wrong we know it's rotten how do we know it's wrong we know is wrong because the president of the united states took pains to hide this and lie about it from people when it was first discovered that there was this meeting and then he lied about lying about it and now he may be lying about
out whether he knew about it at the time
he said at the time by the way and we should all were call this of that the meeting was first reported on that anybody would have taken this meeting this is the kind of thing that happens in campaigns know it's not and the way we know it's not his all the efforts they took to obscure it and make sure we never learned about it are left
austrian on let's go back to the metaphor trial from way which of metaphor if men afford it
been convicted metro will be because their are in a way of witnesses against him have been offered immunity or reduce themselves rotates to expand the number one person and met in that category
how how is it that prosecutors effectively use witnesses like that who are themselves compromise your themselves basically same getting getting protected
in order to turn on their former boss or former colleague s really normal some prosecutors to use the witness and it's like that they're good witnesses right they tend to have a lot of detail they have a close observed information sometimes they have documented something that's just a classic clay and rec it seems allow position to make i'm in
already and the testimony
the effort by that it sounds to say gates acts i did all this themselves in terms of you now tax and bank fraud without manifests knowledge some of the than doris have been on disputing that and denying it i know way we're dealing with matt forte directly sell on you know there's a real claim the prosecutors are following year
witnesses rarely come in the form of mother teresa with unblemished records they if you're the
a witness against a partner who is accused of a crime and you have actually already found guilty to a crime yourself you're open to being impeached and that's why god invented documents to go along with that and corroborating witnesses who may also be less than stellar by it you you add up
the legitimacy we may not actually hear from rick gates and which is why don't you think ruth i'm in the crossfire yes so they weren't sure whether they were gonna call on and i was surprised that up a little weird but maybe they just don't wanna open them up for other reasons that we can't imagine yet maybe i have they have a pretty strong documentary case we'll see
say one thing about this trial
which is we need to have cameras in court rooms if we don't have cameras in court rooms we should certainly have audio in courtrooms it is just outrageous in the modern era that we are not able that ordinary people out there who might be interested in this are not able to hear if they want and have a lot of time on their hands
all the testimony free themselves and make decisions about what they think is going on and have to have it filtered through us in the news media i cannot
why things need to change when in wouldn't it be great to have cameras in the courtroom and maybe god will bless us spearheaded and test for i wouldn't that be glorious to see the chances of pomona for testifying not would you bet your ostrich case or and i were in right now
my non existent awestruck skin but absolutely fantastic looking glazer on it
a car and they i think you're going to have an os treads glazer and should be like orange or pink bow as looks like the ostrich colors go to correct that diana know i was like like mine to be real
i say it but united and i don't get to know a color asked her to get covered with feathers
skin
the feathers it's know who leather allowing well i did that's why the textures didn't look covered with feathers i think against all this time i've been thinking about the nine hundred and fifty dollar tie there was a nine hundred five yellow tail i am a very very deep thinker
i spent some time last night looking at the photos that were put into evidence or at least into the record of all of his clothes and let me say sound of them are really hideous and there was also nine hundred and fifty dollar ties

how to get first listeners i'm interrupting the show this week because we're doing the sleep plus pledge drive and i'm here with the editorial director slate plus gabriel roth gabriel's in new york i'm in d c
we magic of connection it's like we're together
almost
almost together romans together i feel very close to your retina do
i really admire your voice do i really like how your voice sounds people tell that to me sometimes but i want to voice flattered you lovely voice that's so nice of you know if feel even closer to you but the way the listeners can feel even closer to you david is by joining slope pluses narrowed it is sleepless is
slates wonderful membership program and it is a chance for sleep listeners which i guess you are because you listening to this broadcast and sleep readers to support what we do it's late so it's a chance for you to support the pod cast that you're listening to the first and to the other shows that were doing that is trump castle
there's amoco there's the just they're slow burn their sleep money there are more than twenty five pod guess which is crazy and have a huge number with this wealth of opinion and analysis all that smart all of it considered and sleepless is a way for you to say hey i value
this excellent independent journalism its latest producing and i value guess i get it wasn't too i'm going to give slate some money to help support that and of course it's not simply what we're doing in your ears it's also what we're doing online the the magazine itself the articles and videos and stories of all sorts that we're publishing
are so valuable especially in the trunk bear are you out of writers like general buoyed leftwich markets of stern their writing about the biggest stories of the day they're giving incredibly smart independent non partisan aggressive coverage of the most important issues that the country faced
and it takes money to fund that and of course slate gets some of that revenue from advertising and tumbled from other sources but but we value the contributions that readers and listeners like you can get the chance for you to support something that you clearly value and to allow us to continue to do
do this work
so that's that's kind of one piece of what you get was late close but it is not by any stretch of imagination the only thing you go to sleep cloth and in fact there is with for public guess listeners there's a special treat that you get with sleepless which is what gave well as i think gab first listeners have probably heard every episode of the gab first has
an extra segment at the end of it if you're listening to the gab fist and you're not asleep plus member you're not getting the whole show you're hearing the three hosts talk about three political topics and then right when your version of the recording and they continue to talk they loose their collars they let it hang out a little bit and they talk more
about something else something often something related to the news or to politics often something a little bit more personal
there was a recent episode in which john dickerson and who was guest hosting talked about moving from charlottesville to new york and also about their feelings about charlottesville placed above them care for profoundly but is now at the center of our struggle against resurgent fascism and white supremacists i'm in america
it was really personal but it's political it was quite profound and affecting and there's a way in which on the slope postpone a segments that come every week you sometimes get to those those human moments that i think pod cast fans really cherish you get them a lot more in those postpone bonus segment so every week a bonus segment every week know
ads in the game there's no ads in any of your favorite slay pod casts much more than that every week on our slow burn and or our watergate mini series we did a complete bonus episode for slate plus members every week going deeper into the watergate story season to have that shows coming out soon it's about the bill clinton impeachment and monica lewinsky and can starr
will be a bonus episode every week was long detailed analysis and interviews and conversations about the people who were involved in that crazy story only slate plus members are going to get the ear those episodes
there's are slate academy series the ones with gennaro billy about the history of slavery in america and about the failure of reconstruction after the civil war and one about fascism in europe with rebecca onion in june thomas and just keating
i've learned a ton from those series and they're only first les plus members there's a ton of stuff that you get as a slave plus member in addition to doing the really important thing that david was talking about of supporting the content that you love and cherish if you really value this show if you value the other pod cast slate makes if you value slave as a website if you think it's an imp
news source in an important part of the media especially right now we want you to help support it and you can do that by joining slate plus you can go to sleep dot com slash gab zest plus act thank you for joining me david
back to the show slate dot com slash gab fest plus but have a fight about three the printed guns on tuesday day before download day a judge in seattle bard a libertarian gun enthusiast and cody wilson from upload any his massive files the internet which contain the specs that would allow anyone
two three d print a plastic gun a gun that would come without serial numbers the gun that might be able to sneak through metal detectors
wilson had been barred since i think twenty thirteen from releasing has plans are released releasing his plans on the internet
when the obama administration use in arms export control law to prevent him from applauding nom they invoke this law and the subsequent litigation and delays and kept us in the courts and and off the internet for several years although wilson had already uploaded the the specs previously and so one hundred thousand people that are you downloaded them
the trumpet administration has reversed the state department arms control ban and said they're not going to enforce it or it's had that doesn't apply and eight even paid a bunch of wasn't legal bills but this judge's decision or just order basically said look the cost of really think these out into the wild is enormous so until we
get settled or not not allow them to be uploaded so
in fact three the gun designs are already available on the internet you can get designs there are a lot of them wilson's on ones have already circulated it's also already legal to make your own gun at home it's a tradition that dates back before the revolution
it's also the case that three guns
are hard to make expensive and shoddy and you'd be an idiot to make one rather than go out and buy get a gun and basically any other method will get you a better gun
so why why why is this a big deal
he might you be any it to do it that way unless this seem like an interesting challenge you are you wanted to try to smuggle a gun on a plane atlas plastic in way more difficult to detect through ordinary mechanisms or if you wanted a gun they call them ghost guns that did
have a serial number and couldn't be traced teal sell you could be answered as an enterprising happiest here or you could be a really bad person
a big deal because it just it's a it's a hard case because this information as information is want to do is already out there and circulating and if you are a bad actor
or an enterprising happiest you could probably already find it and three d printers are not
that difficult to access them in public library you can my daughter is an architecture student does a lot of three d printing these days and yet we find ourselves in a country with more guns than people we are desperately trying to figure out constitutional
ways to keep these guns and of the hands of dangerous people and make sure that these guns are not brought into places like airplanes and other places where we need to keep them away from people and this is just another one of these manifold techno logic
called challenges where the technology seems to have kind of outpaced our capacity to deal with it and perhaps outpace the law
i'm going to start arguments you shortly but let's let's get some more stuff out here to emily wife and said a district straight up first amendment issue this person has a bunch of files this is information this is this these are words and code and numbers that he wishes to distribute and therefore he should be allowed to distribute them in the way
you should be allowed to distribute your articles in the way that i can upload a random string of numbers the internet should i so choose why is why is this constraint on his free speech
legit constrain all he may still went on those grounds cutting grass and i think can just current such a key charging us and all best i mean we're focusing on that's because hey has been successful and his pr strategy where he was not successful and has legal strategy and tell the champ administration just changed position came down you know
it is not a settled question at least not nationally by the supreme court that all computer code is protected by the first amendment and even if it does all counter speech we have limitations on speech mean you know child pornography is really all that is also data that is shared over the internet counterfeit that money
he is illegal and so there's the point at which the speech analogy always breaks down and you can move into conduct that the government has a strong enough interest in
in banning and preventing the spread out now that's a different question for mother it's really a fact that not at this point sense as a sad the plants on these three the plastic attacks lay on undetectable and untraceable guns are already out there but it doesn't mean that the government should give up a winning position
last lawsuit to make it easier to spread misinformation
i said several things i also do not like the idea of using a law which was designed for one purpose his arms control export law was not designed for this purpose it had totally other things in mind it was not designed to to to stop what what it's being used to stop here
military equipment right yeah yeah yeah i don't like the idea of been invoked for a totally separate purpose congress had shown no intent to to bargains like this and i'm personally i'm sorry to interrupt you were wrong there is a congressional law that prohibits the manufacturer and use of class
guns so under that i am just and your kind of organs another yeah i'm glad you're good housekeeping argument that this law is not intended for that purpose than i have some sympathy with it but it's not true and then i will apologise interrupting you and let you guys are saying that and yeah
know that that's totally fair but you're you're actually right although yes congress
has said you cannot manufacture and detectable guns
i think what wilson would argue with that were not manufacture anything yeah see it as argue that over and over yeah you're right
sadly mind giving him tidbit bit of information the way the anarchist cookbook told people how to make bombs
i'm just telling them something that they can do if they want you to that's number one
i just feel like look there probably will come the day when three d printer guns are extremely reliable that you can make them in a cost effective way at scale
and you can do it in your garage that day is nowhere near here the guns that are being contemplated here are incredibly unreliable they don't they basically don't work there are more dangerous to the person who who manufactures the person who might use to the person is using it then to the person they're shooting at there is this very long and honorable tradition of homemade guns and this country and
you you go after it at your peril i'd actually think that the vast majority people who to make guns on their own are doing it because they are gun enthusiasts and hobbyists and have and at are interested in doing it for for intellectual reasons and pleasure reasons and and to spend a lot of time and energy on going after them seem
like a a huge waste of time
there is not these these designs are available and have been available for years and i don't think we've seen any evidence of a crime upsurge of these guns being used in any way and therefore to to focus a huge amount of intellectual energy and legal capital and time on fighting it seems like a big waste of time to me and finally it's like
of all the issues that gun you can you know
america's gun policies totally fucked up and bad but of all the issues to spend time focusing on this seems like a maybe five hundred on the list because so many things that these attorney general's could be doing other than stopping these plants from getting on the internet and giving giving an irritating people like me who who want to sympathize with gun control efforts
i just feel like they've made they picked the wrong battle are so many other things that matter so much more so how is all back and change when someone smugglers one well named plan the exceptional plastic gotten that works through airline security and then like takes on a plane in there just to prove it can be done or
shoots and like we don't need something to be comment and to be really dangerous when are talking about plastic gun that can't be detected a novel sectors
you are positive something that hasn't happened and i can give you so many other terrible things that happen every day with with the free availability of guns
so you don't need to invent a bogeyman about i mean like that
we already know that assault weapons are dangerous we already know that that not licensing people in a serious way that allowing conceal carry to to spread that having stand your ground laws to spread is much more dangerous than anything else to to to spend this time and energy focusing on on these ghosts guns which is it's just
it's an illusory issue it's a ghost issue seems to me like a like a like a distraction and a waste of time it seems to me like up and also constitutionally wrong incidentally it seems to me like a percolating issue in other words technology is rapidly advancing three d printing technology is rapidly advancing
it may be difficult to make an effective safe as a safety the user on plastic gun now
that's kind of look awfully different in two years maybe or four years and so saying you shouldn't worry about it now because not a problem now doesn't seem to me to be the most responsible thing to do and and there are challenges with dealing with a lot of the other legal challenges constitutional challenges
with dealing with a lot of the other things that you mention so and by the way the thing that this is my killer argument president trump says you're wrong that one of the fascinating things that happened that the oh so rare white house briefing yesterday was that and sanders said the president has this happened the just commented and let the president and this
was happening and he thinks it's wrong
hot
i'm not interested in that that's not a killer damage i have entrusted all the many i and our age
that is anti three per to go islamic the money than any other that in iraq on making now gardens right i mean are at least as i as are and contractor
i wonder if you're misreading the politics i mean it seems to me that the idea than and is taxable untraceable plastic gun could be a game changer and ruth is right like the technology isn't here right now but it doesn't seem all that theoretical that it's within reach and that it's something we should be planning for and
namely that our laws have to change and take a different approach and start focusing on gun possession and try to get back but but i just don't understand the lesson of hastening of this
next step have access to undetectable app pens well you knew your maker totally fair point i'm money which was like it may well be that a more effective political argument because people get worked up about the idea of a three d printed
undetectable gun even though it's it's a fake
as a rational person i just find over blowing the threat from these things it pisses me off
there are so many other genuine threats out there we talked about one last week with to stand your ground and in fact that wherever you turn people are conceal carrying guns all the time but i find her eyes and was strange to me like right at this moment okay that seems oh okay i'm not sure i totally agree with you but i'm like ninety five percent error to you but if
you know we're two to five to ten years away to a situation in which people can make the gonna stand why are we laying the groundwork for right now
because no one's going to bother to make these guns too easy to get a gun and every other no not an undetectable plastic and does not that's not true and one that's untraceable all those things are really right now and we are handing people the means to make it much easier to get them despite those laws people don't kill people don't it's not that i'm
to people committing crimes that they have an undetectable go one i i don't want any other some people really isn't yet to some small number of people because he's now people on them the reason you do a lot of the reason i mean
handful get caught in crimes is rarely because they're gonna trace not never but that's not the reason the reason is that they leave fingerprints and clues everywhere they go and because there witnesses and because their security cameras that's the reason people get caught it's not because the gun is untraceable except in a few rare occasions and but i just don't like as a thing to get worked up over
over i don't want to do it i would rather get worked up over the thing that does seem to me to be killing lots of people and which seems an active thread not not the matter with the hype around in order to govern and then bam my country is not a wash and guns i might get care more right no i mean look very as a hyper asked an argument and even if we are facilitating the next big terrorists
act when you're thinking about risk rationally that doesn't stack up against all of the you know homicides and suicides by gun which way countenance everyday and name mount through the years however i think a lot of people have a different gut reaction to the notion of plastic undetectable guns on airplanes
that seems dangerous
so clinically i saw this on a different way which is that an in my assumption was trump was having and just like gut reaction of like wait a second this doesn't sound like a very good idea and has both come out in favor of guess on as you know part of freedom and liberation under the second amendment and also expressed doubts about it that kind of having and both
ways but you may be right that it is actually winning political issue which and therefore and therefore gun safety and gun control it should work be very worked up over it because they can win on it
that's a good argument i just i just think it's i think it's not season
not nearly the problem that people want to make it out but that but you're right
as a political issue it might be a winner hair as pretty good i think team that are effective way on now we did we got him
nordstrom has a special holiday tree for you for a limited time on nordstrom him dot com get free two day shipping and select areas on thousands of items just in tears that cut on their site to see all the great items you can shop exclusion supply
in the category of comically wicked ideas springing from need money bags who populate the top of the current administration we bring new treasury secretary newton's latest notion floated phone and privately and almost certainly not go anywhere but has no she has to cut capital gains by one hundred to two hundred billion couple of games taxes excuse me
by one hundred to two hundred billion dollars over the next day decade by changing how the treasury accounts for inflation capital gains and doing this without legislation doing this by feared by stroke of the pen at the treasury department and how they interpret certain regulations currently if you buy a share of something at one hundred dollars a share and it goes two thousand
to share and you sell it you pay taxes on them at nine hundred dollar difference at the relatively low capital gains rate internet might not know normal income it but if inflation if you sort of said inflation if if if you if you had that hundred dollars and inflated over time it would have been worth two hundred dollars
so you should only be taxed on the difference between the two between the two hundred dollars in one thousand dollar so you'd only be taxed on eight hundred dollars and you would save a significant amount of money and it has called indexing it has been rejected repeatedly or never adopted repeatedly by the by congress the bush administration also consider doing this by fear
at some point about fifteen years ago and didn't do it
so ruth
how could they even be contemplated to pure giveaway to the richest people in the country and they really were thinking about doing now okay it is yet another pure giveaway to the richest people in the country and it is outraged piled upon outrage there is the outlay hours
piled upon outraged piled upon outrage
currently i'm going to say outrage number one is that we are in a deficit soaring position i know we don't talk about it or worry about it anymore in which the last thing we need to do as trillion dollar deficits come roaring back is to add another come
one hundred billion dollars to the dead at least number two is that if you were going to spend that extra money these that either last human beings on earth on whom you would spend it and that would be the super rich who would reap the
is there something bigger than my share
super lion's share of the benefit here than i am interrupt or that statistic that i yet and amazing so more than ninety percent of the benefits go to the top ten percent eighty six percent of the top one percent and nearly two thirds to the top point one percent thank you numbers are good things there's there's john
iron chef so they don't these these are not forgotten trump voters said he told us he was going to be paying attention to the forgotten meant working men and women number three on which is just what send you into kind of hyperspace of outrage is the notion of doing this by executive see at
i thought we heard a lot of complaints during the obama administration about how he was doing things to executive order and it was outrageous and we needed to pass legislation and the notion that you could pass a tax cut by the stroke of the president's pen is just crazy making and it should be
particularly crazy making to people who call themselves conservatives okay i'm done to why did they float this idea and when it's obviously not going to happen they've already basically walked back oh don't don't don't don't be so sure of a yeah i feel like a floating it because they think it's bad to have people you know nah
be able to account for inflation on there
benefits i mean the other thing i'm puzzled by as if if this whole notion of adjusting for inflation is strong porn for taxes then when you make the whole tax code change in this way so they wouldn't benefit the super rich i shouldn't we have this rationalization if that's what it is happen for the rest of us
ooh i am i'm puzzled by that so emily here's where i actually didn't interrupt you okay so i don't need to
to be a girl and apologize all the time
we do actually have some rationalization but not all currently built into the tax code for example income tax brackets for regular income are indexed for inflation so if you were designing the perfect tax code also known as not in any way the tax code that we now have there might be a legitimate are
you meant for designing a capital gains code that also took inflation into account but let's be serious we have a capital gains rate that is david pointed out is way better than the raid on most people's ordinary income it is huge benefit if you can take your income and realize
as a capital gain so that people it's not only that the people who are benefiting from this change don't need an additional set of tax cuts it's that they are already benefiting from the kind of dual nature of the tax code which gives preferences to capital
games already so on in another break and by the way let's tie have some numbers also was just a study by the institute for taxation and economic policy i think i'm getting the name right that looks at the totality of tax cuts that have been a mass during the bush clinton bush
obama and trump years and it came up with two trillion dollars not two trillion dollars total but two trillion dollars was the amount that slowed to the top one percent these top one percent the don't need more to we have this rich guy economy problem we're basically the entire upper out
rios corporate oriented around help in the super rich and earth were isn't the republican party though
one hundred percent oriented around i feel like even magnified by the fact that the two top economic policy makers and the country who are you are the president and his treasury secretary come from part of the economy bitter fond memory different than the part three community most with limit to minute and comes out of finance
and trunk comes out of real estate and neither of those are the are you really know of those are the path of the economy where people you have a lot of workers who are working for a company who benefit who who are relatively low paid and who benefit from economic growth the bearer finances is essentially an intellectual profession where your
or you're competing for money and it's not about the creation of of economic activity that helps the world really i mean if only indirectly that way and real estate it's about accumulation of a
asset which only one person can have access to and as doesn't it doesn't employ people to it doesn't create jobs for people in a way that other professions do and i think that as a result we have we end up with it it magnifies the tendency to do economic policy that really just helps rich people rather than thinking about work or how workers can benefit and
and one
we've seen we've seen one other point which is to sleep in separate point which is the benefit of the term tax cuts has fallen overwhelmingly the corporation does it was expected
and what of corporations done with all that money is that they don't stock buybacks show that they've spent a huge percentage of the money that they're getting to buy back their own stock which basically benefits shareholders should benefit c e o's in particular because see tend to hold lot of stock and doesn't benefit workers at all because workers don't get enough
thing because most workers don't own anything more than a normal share and the companies that they worked for and and instead it again that's a game that has simply flown to the very rich in a way that that the economically completely unproductive it's not investment it's not new new planets it's not new jobs it's nothing like that it simply it simply
capital gains for the the richest people in the country it just makes you say so this is like that comically pluto craddock propose all flooded as you said by stephen and the treasury is actually a like has untold wealth by a president as lots of wealth are their political consequences
for that's that seems pretty easy to grasp on if they don't do it
you people will hear about it so that there's one other player that we should mention here who's the president relatively new economic advisor larry kudlow who is also a big proponent of this i was a session on the hill with a bunch of congressional aides earlier this week and i saw somebody asked the question should we take this proposal syria
leslie and as something they would deal either unilaterally or through legislation i thought they were gonna add this is a bipartisan group lotta off the table for the reasons you suggest that this is not a political winner and they said none are now this this this looks like it could be serious so brace yourselves
well if the democrats don't find a way to throw in the face the term folks and throw in the face and republican politicians the unfairness of good what's happened in the economy in the unfairness of a tax cuts
they are committing political i'll practice they gotta be able to to to indicate that to voters because it's disgusting it's absolutely disgusting what has happened to regular wrote a regular workers on the contrary and nano workers in the country when you look at the benefits that are going to the richest people it just there should be pitchforks there should be petra
fun and and class warfare there should be class warfare it's incredible but there isn't cause worker can you guys even come up with a more appalling measure do come up with something which would be like wow
they really came up with something that was just really gross even and there are some if you know we talk about targeted tax cuts this this tax cut is exquisitely well targeted i think again
pass and said emily pointed out yeah the inheritance tax changes are equally disgusting tank good yeah that's a good one too but you know that i think that the answer to the democrats malpractice and i agree with you is it is very hard when the president has the argument about an economy that is
worrying at four point one percent growth albeit for a quarter and be it to stop by advance spending by people who are trying to deal with his is coming tariffs and things like that he if people don't take in details about economic argument
it's a kind of take in the sort of broad sense of how they're feeling and broad numbers and the economy's doing pretty well right now and that is wind republicans backs
approximately every two hours one pennsylvania dies from the trunk of us left want mothers fathers
children and fans
explains because every second counts
see the live stream
blocks
a visiting paid back splash of the night
people of pennsylvania taxpayer dollars are let's go to cocktail chatter
you're sitting on your yacht
emily
your yacht your low tax yard and shadow
the new york times magazine where i work is in the midst of publishing an amazing issue about climate it's called losing or said has incredible photographs and miss
stork all kind of majestic narrative and the thesis is that between nineteen seventy nine and eighty nine the world had a real real chance to deal with carbon emissions to prevent climate change and came close and failed and sell it is the story of that decade and that attack
and failure and it's one of those like historical counter and you're being asked to imagine that something could as
could have come to fruition that didn't
just really worth reading and thinking about and knees waning summer days on as you know we seem at least in this country to be further away from really addressing climate change
mine a family allows to you follow the counter arguments made by a lot of climate science people who i thought very effectively pointed out some deep problems with with a narrative yeah i have been writing that wall or at least just starting to and my husband paul saving on environmental and starting a l was also in
fasting some preliminary skepticism to me this morning and you know i think that's all part of that rate like you put a provocative cases like this out there you marshall your attention than you know other people knock it down and sometimes they win that argument that it's kind of all intellectually interesting
so your shatter my chatter is in the age of trump they're probably two ways to to escapism
one is one of my kids is doing is binge watching old episodes of the west wing or you know for me it would be watching like old hugh grant movies than just but but i seem to be trending much more towards kind of binge watching just hope he and issue tv series so my husband and i have been settled in night after
with babylon berlin as usual a little bit late to the game came out last year
but it's very tangled convoluted story about
corruption and intriguing why mara germany and there's something about this sort of
decadence of it that is a little bit uplifting in the sense of you're thinking about other people's troubles for a change instead of what's going on right in front of your face so i'm that's my cocktail chatter i'm quite enjoying it
alright
i have a cockroach but first are do listener chatter again listeners you are you still got zagreb a game to cocktail chatter in just a reminder were soliciting your suggestions for your you would be chattering about it you're at your yacht band cocktail parties

you think get like to know in this week's cocktail to her actually was going to be my chatter and then i'm green neck at green neck
beat me to it and it's an amazing set of info graphics produced by bloomberg about how america
it uses its land and actually the authors let me get the authors because they did such a good job so it is the authors are dave maryland lauren leather be on bloomberg and it's it's
a bunch of they cut the data different ways but the most incredible map which you may have seen and your twitter feed his his shows how we use land the percentage of land devoted to different human activity so the urban housing for example turns out to be where the percentages i don't have the percentages here
urban urban housing turns out to be basically new england if you had all urban housing that would occupy new england livestock is forty one percent of us land wow
crazy with never private family timberland it's the entire pacific northwest airports airports or airports are measurable amount the hundred largest land owning families together occupy so one hundred families together have basically have the entire state of florida which is shocking
urban commercial is basically the equivalent of new york state
the food we eat is basically pennsylvania and ohio is takes up all the food that we eat anyway it's a wonderful set of graphics that green pointed out to check those out to my my chatter however are too quick ones one is the atlantic has a great photo essay
of bike share graveyards and china so in china has a ton of bike share program i think this on dieting
i'll say i don't know
i saw some amazing photo essay on this recently like months cow them in my essays of the bikes sort of blake shares as they're getting launched the huge numbers of bikes but now it's all these bikes end up being broken or abandoned enter the picture okay navy sailor
status detail and so it's just these photos of incalculable huge numbers of bikes some of which are and dump some of which have been crushed into cubes in a huge piles of tires that have been stripped off bikes
it's just been do steam the photos and then my other chatter is just that over the last three nights i have read to my nine year old son the lion the witch and the wardrobe which he had never read and i hadn't read to him and my goodness that buckled up wow does that buckled up holy and keep dying because you now
