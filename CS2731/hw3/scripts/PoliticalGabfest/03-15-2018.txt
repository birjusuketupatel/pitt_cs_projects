on this week scan this i would say and i will i will appeal to both of you that this was one of the news last week i can remember that didn't have something like absolutely catastrophic in a just unbelievable amount of news unbelievable variety of story so we're not could be able to get to all be incredible things that are happening to us to toys r us toys r us
closing the house russia investigation into north korea were not going to get the north korea
oh i'm sure john pick your favorite story
it's incredible you know you did a pretty good job there between venice and the toys are us
i mean it was an iconic brand and a part of growing up who didn't love walking down the aisle and seeing all the things you couldn't get but i also felt like
oh yeah they've been in bankruptcy for awhile and retailers you're taking a pounding from online sales and so are i knew it so you have to mark the moment but it wasn't like i guess i wasn't surprised by how crazy this week is that we're actually not talking about north korea and the impending will believe it
we see it summit meeting oh we're not even going to talk about britain exploring diplomats accept and panels it's insane anywhere and on thursday the president signed a letter finally after going to dragging their heels signed on with germany and england in pushing russians to account for that
what for poisoning and love the foreign minister of russia said we had no motive which is not exactly this missing we did
we have no motive but we did it anyway like i said it's like a cat
it's like why the hell the elections coming up going on
so what we will talk about we would like wet the short unhappy tenure of secretary of state television
what does his departure portend his replacement compared to a secretary of state then an extraordinary democratic victory or i guess a parent victory seems pretty pretty locked at this moment in a special how selection pennsylvania
and what that signals for the twentieth teen midterms
and then there is turmoil and american public education or teachers on strike in west virginia are winning a strike in west virginia threatening to go on strike in oklahoma where schools are barely operating to begin with we have students walking out everywhere and then a secretary of education who appears to know practically nothing about her job which makes her probably the fourth most qualified
cabinet member of the trump administration
plus we will have cocktail chatter and to live show announcements we have our portland show next week really excited john wayne i will be in portland oregon on wednesday night show is sold out to know more tickets there but they're still tickets available for a saint louis show and may second and i'm thrilled to say we're going to great gets jason candor

president from fired secretary of state rex torched by tweet on tuesday tiller soon the former ex on ceo never quite achieve the olympian heights of previous secretaries of state is it just like a tad short jefferson or a larger i had this is not allow
this is not original that i saw somebody suggesting that his autobiography would be present at the destruction who wrote president the creation dean acheson anxious and
he was an extraordinarily ineffective secretary across in all kinds of ways he was undermined by his boss who was constantly mocking and stepping on him
he had different views on foreign policy and then his both seem to have he was had by all accounts a terrible organizational leader which is surprising considering he'd been ceo one of large companies in the world but he managed to get very few senior staff in place and alienated the vast bureaucracy of the state department and oversaw
the shedding of probably half of the senior diplomatic corps while he was there and or a short time and state department morales apparently quite shattered towson will be replaced pending tend approval by cia director mike from pale the former tea party congressmen who has one president trumps goodwill by been in america first are like him and by
by been around a lot and giving present trump lots of briefings so ruth will america be better off without tiller then there's an argument that he didn't have authority that he couldn't speak credibly and but he ruined the daily worker but apartment and so will the state department be better off with somebody who shares trumps
views and might be a better better organization it so i'm reminded of the old joke i think it's about like that catskills resort were and guy is complaining about the food and he says the food is terrible and there isn't enough of it the portions are too small
that really angry at holidays
i thought an old jewish joke
delivered on ticker
now i said
my point now
try think
from this he will the accident is that
tiller sin
what really was a terrible secretary of state he didn't either m t is the language of corporate life that he came from he didn't manage up very well his primary constituent the president and he didn't manage down and when you do that you're just last getting nothing accomplished
and yet we may miss him when he gone because the question is whether mike pumping will rain in the worst excesses of his president or whether he will simply inflamed then as we go into it we weren't going to get to talk about north korea but as we get go into this
extremely delicate and potentially dangerous negotiation with north korea over that impending some it john you're a student of organization and of how washington works
do you do share with instinct that it may be dangerous to have somebody who is aligned with with trump rather than to push back or is it good to have the secretary of state been able to speak with authority which teller some coaching that was able to will i have a couple of
no i think that's one perfectly reasonable way of looking at and i think we have a depends which play they're running first of all to respond the focus on north korea's is important
president is about to engage in where he has a guest english in the first step of negotiations with north korea some people think he has done well up to this point getting north korea and a want to talk but he botched the first round of the conversation which is to offer himself as a as an interlocutor immediately usually had something you use as a prize and you get north korea
make a bunch of concessions to get the prize of meeting with trump and since one of the things that they may want to work out here is a gift of prestige in exchange for taking away the missiles the missiles are about prestige the nuclear power is a nuclear weapon is about prestige in north korea so you want to give it something to have a place that there is
already a problem in the negotiations so now you're changing the team it's not just tiller son it's also perhaps he term master the national security advisor who's leaving with team that was in place ran on a modified madman theory which was in part that you had the president being incredibly bellicose about north korea and then you had somebody working the diplomacy people you admire
mostly working the diplomacy was mad is and tiller son with a german monster doing his bit at the white house
the madman theory requires a tiller son like figure not a nother mad madman which is just shorthand for not another person giving the most bellicose version of this and this is not just in dealing with the bank channels to north korea but it's dealing with the south koreans and chinese and japanese and the russians and the germans and the brits
lot of people and you need coordinated work and you need somebody to go do the work who has an interest in it has an interest in international organizations
way that the tiller and nominally did certainly does more than the president so that's all a big problem and that's just on the north korea front on the organizational front this is one of the reasons why this notion that businessman can come and waltz into government and have this supernatural power which was in part with animated both the president's rhetoric
it's also about tourists and also people's general view who have this idea that if you've been successful in business it can make you successful in government there is a lot of evidence and the people who have studied lists like town like i'm dead harvard suggest and i talked to secretary levitt former secretary about this is that the success you've had in the private
sector can sometimes be an impediment if you're in a certain kind of business that doesn't elevate adaptation but elevates essentially rule following and hierarchy it you're very confused when you come into a place that has a whole new set of hierarchies a whole new set of patterns you try to do something radical and then you lack the the kind of sure footed nice to deal with all the
on the fly challenges you gotta face and that's just from the organizational peace the other thing is in terms of managing up its donald trump is an extraordinary hard boss to work for as the busload to busloads of former officials having left his his employer would a test
we're very quickly without a jacket most of us both local official so
the times made an interesting claim this week
that trumps rapid movement on methods replacement of course of compare reflect his job that actually what we see is not too many of us i think look at with administration think this is a man who doesn't know what he's doing it he that of control and there's certainly plenty of evidence of that but there's another counter notice now he's getting comfortable and like i don't have to
with and all these people who told me i had have a television in place i'd ever mcmaster i can have my own people and do what i want that so there's always been a little bit of that they're not the boss of me aspect to donald trump's behavior if they're lawyers tell you you can't do something that is the surest fire way to get donald trump to do something and we've seen that all along that i think you'll is maggie
hey agreements plane and this should be true of anybody who goes into the presidency that he was she said something along the lines of he was just scared out of his wits the first six months
and everybody grows increasingly comfortable in their job and i think this may be this may well be his sort of he's out he's out your fire well i'm not saying you're fired that can tell i'm going to tweet that you're fired maybe a manifestation of that it also may be a manifestation of that dumb
management of the guard rails around him and assertive trump nanny state is evaporating so hope hicks is gone rob porter who needed to be gone the staff secretary who couldn't get the clearance in the end because he abused his ex wives and possibly others
is gone and he helped make the process more orderly so when you have nannies leaving those with childlike temperaments tend to assert themselves john raised the role of defence secretary john madden he and tiller sen where this sort of increase
singly thin have served with this increasingly thin blue line to contain president trumps worst instincts when it comes to foreign policy whether it was on the iran deal sometimes they weren't successful
for example on paris
and on korea
that just leaves madness as far as i understand it and see it home alone
and that makes me extremely nervous because that thin blue line is like a very thin thread right now
john one of them weird and troubling phenomena of the trump administration so our secretary to doubt he will be replaced by the cia director
trump appears to be dank lane a secretary david shocking and wants to replace him with rick perry the energy secretary he appears to be perhaps dangling jeff sessions the attorney general and wants to replace him with scott pruitt that his his candidates for replacement of the few people have already agreed to work for him and the only people who are going to agree to go into this administration
now are people who are just venal and power hungry there isn't a lot of appetite to serve for public service and so the quality of people he's going to get in is going to get worse and worse i assume i presume
is there any reason that that these is wrong
i think that stands to reason
gina has poll about with whom there is some controversy because of her role in
in the the his rendition policy and torture is at least so them that's something that she's gonna have to deal with in her
confirmation hearings and we can talk about that maybe you know one another show but in terms of a person who has worked in an institution for a very long time she's a thirty two year veteran people who are supported hillary clinton like my morale was the former number two
i think she is qualified incredible person for the job so to the extent that in these is shifting around that we've seen there's been an elevation of somebody who has credentials within the bureaucracy
that's a person who is so that be the case
gonna like
really that war criminal torture as well at least we have an idea as torch now of it
but there were people that else but i mean there were people elevated the obama administration who had association with those policies as well so that us to do with us policy and the history of this hey in the war on terror which is a problem but it's different in the one that know identified and i just sent her a little bunny it is funny
be by clamoring to have the war criminals but the others that you mentioned
you're right they're having to shuffle people who are already on the team and to have no special expertise and those jobs they're they're going into and jobs require some expertise and if you don't have it requires you a fair amount of time to get your feet under you to act in a way that is expert like and remember anybody you might want to go to this white house
it's not just that it would be working for a difficult boss it's working for a difficult boss who will embarrass you in public and for whom you may have to go out in public and say things where it you undermine your credibility your values and you will end up leaving potentially diminish person and then when you leave it will be fine
heard by twitter the one of the thing i should say about tiller soon as we don't know his ability to manage up we never know the things that didn't happen as a result of tiller send in madison a charming master talking the president out of doing things he wanted to do so in in terms of the maybe nothing but i have been led to believe is fair amount that
they did to keep the president from going and certain direction so it's really only going to beef up until the histories are written that we get a sense of his real ability to manage up even though in public it on a b c looks like he didn't win that many fights so i wonder how long it's going to take for those history has to be written because
donald trump
throughout his career has managed to keep a lot of his bad behavior under wraps by having his ex employees and his ex wives sign non disclosure and confidentiality agreements and we don't even need to talk about stormy daniels in this context but these government officials haven't signed non disclosure agreements they couldn't be recall
to sign non disclosure agreements and then he did this i thought really extraordinary thing of death by twitter with tellers and and i understand that he really enjoys humiliating people and that was deliberate but it didn't seem to me to be very smart given that we now have tiller sin and any know
anger of others who have steep ban in whoever else who have stories to tell about this president and who you would think that the president absence the non disclosure agreement might have handled in a more gingerly way to try to at least secure some degree of loyalty and i'm curious
john her david if you have any instinct about why the president chose then to proceed the way he did with till accent
why on the key is able to fire people on earth person actually well i think is congenital generally are unable he's a coward and what that may be true but that just explains why he didn't do it in person he doesn't doesn't explain why he didn't have cali call and say hey you're gone here is that why he did it by twitter why he didn't call him for and
three hours because he did it in a way calculated to impose maximum humiliation until i suddenly you can see that until her son's face when he went to address the state department in which he didn't mention the president he didn't come off as a fucking funny how that happened now i mean but that's a really really interesting point especially on the question of john kelly your chief is
staff and your boss you're the president wants to do something that you know hurts his his interest having them president look like he is treating his former secretary of state this way on the eve of of this important north korea moment is not good for the presidency is not good for his image and his giant and john kelly's job is to go and make sure stuff like that does
happen so either a he didn't have the instinct to do this or he did and the president wouldn't let him
i want to close this were just making a policy point which is that one of the problem with that i think we have
there's a
a deep philosophical problem with american foreign policy right now which is that both schools of thought or
are incomplete you're going to fail so there's an america first school of thought which is basically what i'm pale and trump subscribe to which is sort of like screw international institutions were gonna pursue are selfish best interests at every particular moment and even if that undermines allies even if that undercuts things that we've done you can have it under
gerd undercuts the network of trade and other kinds of relationships were built up over a decade but is morally very satisfying
like satisfying because it allows you to say we're doing what we want and then there's an american gauged view which is the kind of consensus establishment foreign policy
which is to work through international institutions work with allies don't cowboy around abide by international agreements that you make and neither of them works that well anymore or well the american gauge model doesn't work that well anymore if you're in america because we're just relatively weaker than we were forty years ago and
less ability to push around these institutions and get the deals that we want and because china
is pursuing a similar china is creating its own web in asia and throughout the asian even into europe and africa and so our belief that we can have an american gauge whereby we get to push these institutions do more or less what we would like to do no longer holds so we're faced with either the process
active sort of saying well we're going to work with these institutions and just be relatively weaker than we were which one which is what i would choose to do and what obama chose to do and what tiller send more or less was choosing to do or we can say we're going to screw them and go alone and that creates its whole new set of problems but both of them are some
optimal because america is a relatively weak or nation in the world and we were just won't acknowledge it could point for relief here do you think there are other changes to come in this administration that are similar to this or well it's pretty seismic when you shift secretaries of state that it's very clear that we're getting ready to engage in sort of trumpet
administration musical chairs and i just hope they play the musical chairs on that ben carson thirty one thousand dollar dining set so at least people have good things to sit on and you talked about when they showed them to the door it will be to the one hundred forty exactly that
thinking this just goes to last about who would go into this administration the problem with that premise that question was the premise was that we had the team at the start and i think this just explosion of stories about carson about stinky that we're going to get to and her disastrous interview and all these
people who can't seem to engage in sort of basic common sense behavior of a government official and just suggests that as we lose some people who were adequate to marginal and shift everybody else around we could be in for a world of trouble
guy is just a question of your roof i have my own view and answer to this but i'm interested in your thoughts which is clearly this is chaotic kids obviously like no kuwait house we've never seen before there have been purges jimmy carter purged is cameron at one point but it was a single kind of unitary moment this has been a purge it's been going on almost as soon as the present
came into office the number and kinds of people has been extraordinary who been fired shown out the shown the door i'm embarrassed on their way out and so forth so why doesn't really matter
we're not engaged in any you knew conflicts of to president got his tax can pass people may not agree with it but he got something passed that his entire party all all in favor of he's slashing regulations which is something and republicans have been trying to do for years he's doing better at that than than previous republican presidents have done so what's the problem with all of this other than it's dramatic
not decorous so and
good question to answer is one that is something that you suggested earlier it matters because if you want to be effective in your job you have to have been doing that actually qualified to do it but also even if you're qualified to do it having that doing it for having done it for a while everybody learns on the job if you're there for seven months or eight months or a year and
two months it's not long enough to really effectively get anything done
you point to the things that the trump administration has managed to deal with a really a team in place
it should have been able to do a lot more given the total control of the branches of government some of us who disagree with its priorities should actually breathe a sigh of relief about that the second reason that it matters now is having the b team in place and having not people in place
in fact interestingly the president's been cleaning up the last couple days about how chuck schumer and democrats are blocking his nominees but as far as i can tell the vast bulk of the blame for their home alone government that we have with and especially like look at the people on korea and the absence of an ambassador in the absence of a senior
in the state department responsible for this
the government and the absence of people in the government and the wrong inexperienced people in the government don't seriously matter until they really matter which is when you have a potential crisis and blessedly for all of us donald trump hasn't really experience that whether it's on a foreign policy issue or on a finance
national economic so so that's that's where i get really nervous and as much as i don't want him to be able to impose some of the changes that he wants to impose really think that it's important to have a functional government
speaking of home alone down trip was in home alone to you know
i had if a cameo
that's a really good point it all comes together

connor lamb a lawyer and veteran a conservative democrat appears to have edge republican rick's a cone is that how you pronounce his name become i've never heard it i've just read it to to win the special election for a house seat and south western pennsylvania
the election was kind of crazy there was a huge amount of attention focused on a district that is going to vanish in a few months but it became a symbol for the state of the republican and democratic party in this district had a bellwether quality to it it was a district that donald trump one by twenty points mitt romney it went by seventeen point democrats had not
even run a candidate for congress and the last two elections their conservative group supporting an enormous amount of money outside money into the district to try to win the seat for a cone
although landed a raise and direct money but lamb one by just a handful votes remarkably the efforts that the conservative groups made to tie lamb to nancy pelosi and to try to to use the tax cut bill to make the case for their candidate and to bring true
jump in to actually speak on behalf of the kind and they all did not work
john there's a much brooded about fact that there are one hundred and eighteen districts were trumpet a narrower margin and he did in pennsylvania eighteen democrats want to went twenty three districts twenty three house seats to take control the house could democrats actually end up winning one hundred seats from republicans and is bet that scale
wave money well i don't think there are differences succumbs on an incumbent and there are there are districts that were you having company and so the the power of incumbency might help but
you know when i fixed fixate on here is that what we've seen in in all the special elections even the ones in which the democrats lost what we've seen is a constant inconsistent improvement in democratic performance that's well over what the district traditionally
reduces and so that is a wave that is coming there are also other pieces of evidence that waves are coming there's there's the generic ballad the chose a favor ability for the democrats over the republicans at the center of this is is is that the democrats have a constant energizing mechanism in the president and the energizes of them in two ways
one everything he does every day too because there is this feeling among core democratic supporters that area is a kind of impotence nothing can be done to stop this president and there's only one way that these democratic voters who feel this sense of evidence can fight back and that is through the electoral process and we've seen it time and again play out the know
to bad would be republicans running on one of a couple of things one the success of the tax burden its ability to get past a long time promise republicans have offered to their voters and that they have now kept the second being that the economy is doing well
third being i know i said there were only two but the third being it nancy pelosi is is a person and will be in control and she is a a boogie man or woman and so don't turn out well that didn't work in this race in a district that trunk borne by twenty points and it looks like it's not working in other areas so ruth
there's a or thought would that
voters are much more animated by voting against the part of it if faber than voting for their party and therefore you
if you really hate a trump really hate republicans you're more likely to vote and if you really are keen on your democratic candidate
one conclusion you could draw from that is it's good to nominate therefore
candidate who won't irritate people and the other side should nominate your most moderate candidate rather than your most progressive candidate and lamb fits that model lamb has a very conservative democrat either anti abortion is pro gun he was handpicked by party leaders he's not one of these progressive tapes resistant tapes he's our president told us he's a republican really
he's a republican so what's going to happen
incorrect by the way okay what is going to happen when we have this wave of quite progressive democratic candidates they're going to be districts where you that it makes sense for the party to nominate somebody on the left heel is going to be able to animate progressives but honestly those are not going to be that districts where you are
going to be able to tip outta republican income back for the most part you're going to need to nominate people who are conservative moderate enough to be able to attract those republicans suburban women and other swing voters who have elected republican members of congress all
long and just might be disgusted enough by donald trump and everything else going on this year that they're willing to make the change and so that john laid out three arguments that the republicans have the plus the argument doesn't seem very powerful to me that tax cut argument has not proved to its value to republicans luck it was
not popular when it was passed and it's not gotten very much more popular so that kind of least republicans with the economy and that's always a good argument but this is
most place the most common place where people vote against the other guy as opposed to for their side isn't an off year election so that just helps build the wave
with this much of a wave coming what what should republicans do should they should they should they bother to fight it made sure they attempt to fight it or they just spend the next six months just passing a bunch of stuff that it's going to be favorable to their voters and just prepare themselves to to lose the house in such a great it's such a fascinating question
or a fun question to roommate on if you're going to fight it
you need money
and so you gotta go down from grace and so you got to be the district to do it well as you can't be in washington
trying to pass legislation and by the way it's really hard to pass legislation because you're getting a people worried about being in primary races your got people in districts where the president is an anvil around their ankle and so they're going to try and do things
disconnect themselves from the president they'll do that through voting so it's not like they could come in like lickety split pass a bunch of legislation i also that it was interesting that lanham ran against paul ryan
saying that he was going to gut medicare and social security you know so that's a non donald trump argument that seemed based on some of their early analysis i saw seemed to have some purchase which means the more that activity there is in washington the more he can point to washington the republicans have no you can't run away from a president you just can't do it
just it doesn't work i don't really know what they can do i mean i think the best because it's also very hard to focus in this environment you know one of the goals that a that opposition party like the democrats will try to do is nationalize the election and again i mention this is kind of third element to the fact that don't trump is the best turn out mechanism for democrats he is a constant
attention grabber and in some districts that will be great but the transference between the president and the person he would be endorsing whether it's a cone or roy more than transit translated property has not been demonstrated and you know there's unknown unknown here before the election which is where the russia story is going and what mother is going to come up
with before the election
wait on now
but a suggestion
the answer is probably greater than zero we will hear from bowler in some way before the election again
do you think there's any risk ruth of democrats overplaying this
yeah i think there's any risk of democrats blowing it and car loan i speaking of which ruth please give me your thoughts on hillary clinton's remarks in india
i i get in trouble when i say this because people keep calling me a hillary hater i'm anything but a hillary hater but i'm a hillary sire actually s i g h e r
i just don't think she's helping her south are helping her party with this constant i'm going to use a bad word here whiny sounding we litigation of the results it would be better not to continue to do that both for her own reputation and for the future of her part
that's my view
john it's not fair to just ask the girl so what did you think about hillary clinton's comments i think is a i think you're i think what you say is particularly right for her party in the idea she believes him i think also when the most identifiable gaffe of the campaign was to lump of people into groups lump white women into a group
behaved in a way her argument was that white women didn't vote for him because of their i couldn't quite figure out something about their husbands under their their their husbands dumb they were under their husbands thumbs i don't think that you don't think you want to speak about women and their behavior down talk about air david
given some fresh air
play i don't think you want to speak about women in bulk like that
and so i think that's not good and under any circumstances and it's not good for the for the party in particular as republicans are searching around in the in the tool draw to fund try to find something that will be useful anything that gives them a chance to hold up an image of the elite democratic luminaries kind of looks
down their noses at a certain class of america i think is not to do is not a good things i mean them i mean just to play fares both sides here and trump to an outrageous thing about women were he said fifty two percent of women voted for me
while aren't the only women who cow which white lie and toss right why it is but it is possible in this world of this multi flavored world for donald trump to save things that are totally wrong and and offensive to women and fertile of shirt the same
i have not attempting to defend i didn't pay any attention to what hillary said i trust both of you are under saying that i should note the i heard be noted that trumps heard this sure sure it
far away from pennsylvania fifteen although here to india that were going to but way but their husband wears one yeah he related point about has with the eighteen which only quickly is the fact that currently am ran an ad in which he was a believe it was an error fifteen in the yeah but anyway it was a semiautomatic rifle in and said he still loves to shoot gives you some indication of the
faculty with passing any kind of gun control legislation or talking about it even in the year where democrats are trying to do well in district like the one that limb looks like he won in and it's just you know there's a tension between all the activism in the students that were the democrats were celebrating this week as they walked out from school and the candidates who are have
to run in environments that are receptive to that kind of the message about limiting gun rights

people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars it has no surprise that public education has become a contentious issue in the age of trump there's profound conservative skepticism about bit federal federal role and public education
there are austerity policies and a lot of states that have limited teacher pay across the country but especially in red states there is a class of rich mostly right leaning philanthropists to have been galvanized by the idea and the reality of school choice and charter schools these facts are there was a rebellion
against what
note the national
it wasn't a national curriculum both the call but common core all these combined to make it a very fertile area for both conservative and liberal action we have seen off of public school drama and recent weeks west virginia teacher struck for nine days and won the race that they sought from republican controlled state government oklahoma teach
are threatening their own strike on april second also seeking a pay raise in a state oklahoma where i think fifteen percent of schools now only meat four days a week because they don't have money to meet five days a week which is incredible second lowest paid the country
and secretary of education bette davis the charter school in school choice activist elevated to the cabinet and whose experience in public education seems to have been limited to watching friday night lights perhaps is under fire for a very awkward interview she did with some of john's colleagues at cbs sixty minutes
ruth what was so bad about that interview
what was that about the interview is that decisions do it actually just watched it and you thought what were they thinking
when they being her media advisers and pr team in wow i would just push back as a as a human being i'm like any time a cabinet official in this administration speaks to and on fox outlet
in a public forum i am happy about it so bad really anybody out but now play but it's good for the public of as sure it's good transit currency is because the the public exposing betsy divorces capabilities such as they are is good for the public i'm just saying as a pr matter what was the education department
well i'm thinking with related this what was bad about so bad about it was that she displayed a pretty fundamental lack of understanding of it not just some of that complicated areas that her department is involved in but some of that
core beliefs that have animated her involvement in public education to wit the impact of charter schools on the performance of public schools who lose money as a result of having as students drained away from them on charter schools she wasn't able to answer really
basic questions and i have to indulge myself here by reading
a couple sentences from a parody that my washington post colleague alexandra peter i wrote about the interview and she says lesley stahl have you ever seen a school that the device a school i have well i hesitate to say a school we of course no school is not a building nor is it a bus to bus i'm pretty sure it's not a bus although one could
certainly learn on the bus and it was not that is parity but not that far afield from the way the secretary of education actually sounded the big critique of them
trump administration in these regulations that they're on winding in the policies they're putting in place at all these different agencies as they are animated by a set of beliefs that are basically taken on faith that there's it's one thing to have rigorously investigated point of view
the opposite from the point of view of the bureaucracy and whenever agency you're in or or the ideas of the previous administration if you have a set of theories the to be examined and tested and come to a different conclusion but what was interesting and i've thought about the interviews that there was also a lack of curiosity about the open up the educational process
yes
has demonstrated and so the lack of curiosity plus the unfamiliarity with the with the core ideas and a meeting that's a divorce in the past suggested a lot of proof for this critique of the broader critique of the of the trump administration which is that they're just doing a lot of things
based on and kind of a more of faith based approach them any kind of rigorous or even consistent reason behind them
i am no education expert and all you can
i was nervous you know sharpen your knives right now because i'm probably gonna say something which is wrong and stupid
but here's what i would say there are parts of divorces agenda which i find deeply concerning i think the fact that she's doing a lot of business with coasters and con men but the the her policies on higher education appear to be run by the for profit
colleges rather than by all the other colleges which are the vast majority of the united states i hate the rollbacks and civil rights that she was pursuing and i agree there's a kind of faith based has the right word or charters and school choice
it's faith based on the other hand we're not going to have a national curriculum and this country it just is not how we were we have a bunch of states
education in the state level activity so the federal education is limited and the idea that we we've elected somebody in president trump who wants to pursue this kind of agenda it's not going to massively shift everything that's happening in the country it's going to tinker with things on the edges
they're going to be more charters you can be more school choice and that's going to have an effect which may be bail for may not be be awful but i don't think it seems to me a pretty small set of experiments and to me divorce is not even in like the top five bad trump cabinet members if you compare the effect of what she can do to what's happening at the
yea or what steve minute windows or what the secretary of interior can do the seems to me pretty small beer and and i think the reason the democrats are so animated out it is that teachers are huge constituency in the democratic party and that really makes a big difference but isn't that just like saying that ben
carson can't cause that much damage at higher because he can just you know rewrite the mission statement and make and make it harder for homeless people to find housing and take anti discrimination efforts out of the department's mission but because he can't bring down the economy or bring us into war it's not that big a deal
i mean sort of their guys i think i'm a little bit of there's a little bit of that which i'm saying but it's also because they're fundamentally public education is country is a state level activity and so what the federal government does is on the margins and so the fact that she has a she has an ideology a faith based ideology about school choice and charters is
changes the emphasis of what the department does but it doesn't it's not going to fundamentally change how students are educated in most schools and the country
a lot of federal funding that goes to impact yeah way those local schools and state systems operate and you we're having this national discussion about arming teachers that is now a national level discussion sell it matters who is the secretary of
education i'm an insane and he does it at or under something that doesn't matter that much while compared to what doesn't matter compared to a defense secretary who's not competent which we do have a defence secretary is great and there are a treasury sick or an interior secretary or yeah create secretary where the update their like permanent damage that can be done this is going to be tinkering at the edges and actually like frankly
this certain amount of experimentation and this is fine dc is a city which i live in which has had this huge charter school explosion
which i think has generally been good for the city now i don't i don't have the numbers in front of me but certainly the attention and effort and public education has have been really interesting in the city as as a longtime resident i feel that and so i'm i guess i have some tolerance for the idea that this is a place you can experiment i would agree with that and but i think the question is
experiment and then but but if the experiments are based on
this kind of fades and also that's not so because it under your thinking david you do an experiment studied the results you figure out of their replica bowl and the new replicate them you replicate the good parts and doing or bad this the sense of rigor yes no yes no no faith is right and i'm one of the things i low
with and i don't think of off demonstrates this but certainly a lot of her allies do is this language of meanness towards directed towards public schools and public school teachers the covered schools government schools is this
vicious slander that i find really unpleasant i want to say one mild word in defense of secretary device and then i'll go on to criticize her said nobody panic
i've been very interested in class i support of of the education department's efforts to revisit the question of whether we've got the balance right on sexual assault and sexual harassment and that title nine regulations whether they've gone too far and diminished that due process rights of the
key is students slate colleague emily off he has former colleague emily happy has written very brilliantly about this so you know i give us got a cheer and a half maybe to cheers for raising this but then this is and this was an illustration of how problematic the interview was in it's got a lot less
attention then her comments about charters and failing schools she is asked are you in any way suggesting that the number of false accusations are as high as the number of actual rapes are assault there is one obvious answer to this question which is no i am not by that still doesn't mean that we don't need to be worried about people being falsely accuse that my yeah
answer this is the actual diverse answer well one sexual assault is too many and one falsely accused individual is one too many well that's true but totally inadequate totally town death and i'm totally illustrative of why she should not be in this job and why she was the first a cabinet secretary
to have been confirmed by having the vice president cast the tie break the tie that were going gee
no no i was just
just going to indignantly make
no mouth noises that particular route but i didn't have any
there were even words
well ahead know
the original point about west virginia and oklahoma on the show this week we talk to two teachers and one is the teacher the airfare oklahoma and the other was teacher the year for the whole country and when you talk to them about your of the ever whole country theme a lot better than that he'd year for
when you talk about and by the way the teacher from oklahoma moved to texas in part because of the pay issues in oklahoma
when you when you talk to them about all that has been put on their plate additionally you know it's not just teaching the students anymore
there is the the idea out there that there might be some places where there would be armed teachers which adds a whole new element but then there are the others which is teachers are now supposed to play a role as kind of first responders in looking at any kids who might have issues acute sensitivity and knowing just wanted to jump in
so that none of those those kids can someone with a day later get a gun there has been the increase in testing that has occurred in in all these different school district
and then there's just the general cultural interruption into the day the teachers now i have to deal with more all of which is not based on their core job which is to teach kids information so that i guess the point here is not only has the pain not kept up but the load that is on
is significantly more and obviously since they in these fights in west virginia in oklahoma and even in this national interview to some smaller my degree the message being sent his is as you said david calling them government schools is that the teachers are not valued and that sends a message to the kids ultimately about these people
that we're supposed to that we're putting all the societal pressure on to help shape more than just the brains of our children but also to to make them be good people are at last
question quickly on that because i didn't want to talk about oklahoma in west virginia route
it the interesting and i i think heartening for especially color them broke through low public schools and public school teachers that in west virginia and strike ended with a victory by the teacher june and despite the fact this is completely republican controlled legislature and and governor's office and in oklahoma
looks like the teachers are gonna have a lot of public support as well
why do you think why do you think they were able to win and west virginia
i think that there is public support for teachers people understand that teachers are dramatically under paid based in comparison to the function they serve to society i think that teachers unions can remain powerful even
republican strongholds and the teachers had a moral claim to more money and even in this day and age moral claims make some impact yeah i agree out
one agenda
about but i would i'd think there's such a long as there are so many institutions that are not working well
in this country and i think the idea for americans at public schools which are so important but all of us are most americans spend a first third of their life at the idea that those would be struggling and breaking the way that we see government breaking the way that we see health healthcare breaking that is disturbing to people and i don't i don't think people want
to live in a society where the public schools don't work at all

what's going to cocktail chatter
when you're on the picket lines ruth
having a beer on the picket line
would have a here on the picket line and probably very discouraged probably not encouraged should try it again i'm him and employment
two so i'm not a union member well if you were on the picket line and it isn't even a picket line with a night i would be wrong to want in hand cupcakes people on the route of thing to the picketers about i am really interested in the current issue of the national geographic which is about as my chatter go out with
i have a second one i have an hour while ago
well which is about race and i'm interested in it and a number of different levels one is the editor's note by susan goldberg the editor in chief which just talks about that
this mall and he just can't i'm getting is the word whitewash terrible word here you can't whitewashed the racist history of national geographic in the way it wrote about and they literally use this term savages quote was captain was sort of photos from aboriginal man it said quote south
australian black fellows black fellas been one word these savages rank lowest and intelligence of all human beings yeah nice so they and then i thought that was really interesting because it happens to come in the same week that we saw or video was last week this remarkable
project by the new york times which is to try to fix its past not racist though that may be sexist in terms of filling in the obituaries of women who deserved obituaries and in the new york times it didn't get them and are getting them now so i thought it was interesting to see
bad news organizations can find their own way to make reparations
and then i thought it was really fascinating that simultaneously this issue is and race is a fascinating compelling constant topic
and this issue include stories that talk about how race simply is not scientific concept at all and then it also tells us that race is totally central to various ways in which we understand the world and it has this absolutely striking image that i'm looking at right now on the cover of twin sister
black and white these twin sisters make us rethink everything we know about race one looks why one looks black they're fraternal twins they in a nutshell are kind of the new normal of america and the world and yet races tell front and center in the way we deal with so much i just want to has authors and goldberg and the historic
in your a historian john it when nathan who should commission to study national geographic racist history and which actually the other interesting aspect i thought was the notation to the horribly racist toward africans african americans most dark and people but then there's this weird
id elevation of polynesian of pacific islanders and polynesian beauties so there's a whole collection of their photographs of polynesian beauty to be they focus on right and you can see them evolve over time first they write about south africa and i write about virginia by the way as if they're
there is no problematic racist pastor racist present and then they begin to get a little bit more with the program in the seventy as i was just fascinating yes john what is your camera
so i'm kind of a double check first is just as fun fact which shows some of our lives changed me
already know but stephen hawking when he died
this fact came out he was born on the three hundredth anniversary of the death of galileo and he died on albert einstein's birthday
so for the renewed
physicists there is some order in the universe
my other is to recommend a book by katherine price called how to break up with your phone
so i'm doing a series from cbs about about attention
listeners know this has been something and i've been fascinated with for a long time in the relationship between attention and focus and all of the judge all talking and just
then i'll look into my email
all of the digital wonder that makes our lives so rich but that obviously we need to find some balance about and this is a tidy little book it can be read in one i don't know one as a seller ride if you're on the seller it's a short book but it's super tidy well written and it just kind of takes you both through the the reasons this has become such a problem
for all of us and then also some useful solutions which are better than the like turn your phone to gray scale and other things that are frustrating and not helpful
my cat her own quickly append a chatter to john's chatter for a few weeks ago john shattered up as terror west or book educated got this
the more of a young woman who was raised off the grid by barry crazy millennia
as opposed to more nail parents didn't go to school she worked in a junkyard starting at age ten
it's an incredible book i'm almost done with just as good as john said it was but i'm rhonda filler
deservedly so
and by the way david's even a room immediately leave this pod cast and go listen to my forty five minute interview with the terror to her about the book are not because i want to finish the book first i don't want spoilers are know there's i don't know what's gonna happen
but then i will
but my real challenge
bouche really fascinating new york times magazine story by bobby worth coming out this weekend and it's about the kidnapping of a bunch of qatar we royals and qatar nobility who were on a stupid dumb falconry trip in iraq they went to the iraq desert which is it really stupid thing to do for
several weeks and to engage in the sport that they love of falconry and they were kidnapped by iranian allied militias and they became the pond in this insane set of deals that involve the syrian civil war the negotiations to free them require
the emptying out of four different syrian towns to the population relocation of thousands of people the death of hundreds of people the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars and ransom money and the general humiliation of qatar qatar or you're going to say it a country that has made deals on all sides
it's and that region and found itself trusted and and liked by nobody it's just a crazy story
so i recommend that hey and one more thing
yes listeners there's an exciting job opening it slate that i think you might be interested in i know we have a ton of lawyers and legal folks who listen to the vest because they like to hear emily and ruth and legal wisdom from folks like that and there's a job at slate that might be for
