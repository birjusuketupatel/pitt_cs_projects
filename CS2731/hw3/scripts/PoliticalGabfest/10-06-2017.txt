murdered almost sixty people at a festival of music in las vegas
before killing himself it was of course the worst mass shooting mass murder and modern american history
using an arsenal of legal weapons some outfitted with legal pump stocks the phrase none of us have ever heard until this week bump stocks that effectively turned them into automatic weapons tadic fired from his thirty second storey hotel room at the mandalay bay
indiscriminately murdering and wounding festival goers
at the time that were taping on thursday morning their peers to be no clear reason that he had for commit mass murder other than
a desire to
cause sorrow and distress among people and arm them and i think it goes out saying there's going to be no real political response to it after new town which was the the mess
murder in which twenty twenty two children were gunned down at a school by somebody who had no business having guns
if there was no political action
after that
action i assume they will be nothing that comes out of this
airports that republicans in congress are talking about as well as democrats i should say attacking it out outlying stocks
that would be a very small and specific piece of legislation but it would be not nothing the national rifle association so far has been silent on stock idea that's floating around so maybe they will get quash it but when you see people like john corn talking about it you think
well maybe that republicans could actually take action year and i would assume myself that republicans wouldn't be floating this idea if they hadn't gotten some sense on the and that it wasn't going to be like the end of their careers if they propose such an idea germany think about that
yeah i think there's likely to more be more actually have a response here
then to new town because it's in a sense legislatively the path his legislatively more obvious and easier which is to say the two things people can move to our one the bumps dogs which were in i think it's hard to there were conflicting reports but as many as a dozen
the rifles that he had and the bums talk essentially terms of semiautomatic rifle into something closer to an automatic by using the recoil of the gun to create an automatic burst fire and then the other one is that the suppressor is or silencer spill that was being pushed by the a seems to be now in some even though it's
related here seems to be in had been slowed and might not happen or if it does it will happen in a much different way than what of before this so this guy was obviously motivated patient
and david said the intent all we know is really intent on causing
mayhem and sorrow so
you know if you'd taken the bumps takes away from him he would have found some other way that i don't really like that argument i mean it's not an extent
that he would have found some other way but that's meant that it must have meant he could kill yeah no question no question no question my only point is that if you get rid of those it doesn't solve the problem with people using weapons that can kill a lot of people quickly
you shouldn't mistake thinking that getting rid of bumps stocks argument are going to end
the use of weaponry that can kill but what's what's interesting about this is this is the one of the very few specific examples where you can say actually had lac this piece of equipment
this would have been a much less deadly much less deadly in there sure are much less sorrow folder totally occasion not to say that he wouldn't have done something and sufficient that necessary to ban them
that's all i'm trying to say that's all i'm saying
i do wonder if there will be this is one of these things were those sort of conversation about it talk about it and then you know
there's a long way from conversation to legislation if the house and senate want there to be a long way between comprehension legislation will slow down and then people will sort of gradually forget about it
this is an incredibly frustrating issue i mean it might be my it's one of my least favorite issues in american politics because when people are of americans are pulled their in favor of kind of common sense regulations on guns it because of the night of the ira and terms out that tens of millions of dollars at
cars tech congressional race as there's sort of a stranglehold on anything ever happening and people who are really concerned about maintaining the freedom to have guns vote on this issue they care much more about it than people generally who are in favor of gun control for gotten you know if you're in favor
kind of comment chance gun regulation it's like on a laundry list of issues but it's not something that has exceeded and galvanizing its forces and the same way that the second amendment force i think i think there's a little bit of a canard when people say oh it's the array as a stranglehold it's not the and it's a fact that there are
somewhere between ten and fifty million americans who really have an incredibly strong and passion feelings about gun culture and guns i mean i think i saw a figure which said three percent of americans own fifty percent of americans guns
it's not that the array is is is there there's a large constituency of people who care a great deal about it we're probably concentrated and districts that are red districts and the republicans care about and they are incredibly passion they're much more passionate about the issue of much more directed at the issue and much more dates with the issue then the two hundred and
fifty or two hundred seventy million americans who are skeptical right and that is really important part of it but i don't think that are relevant anyway good well it was like that it's a little thing you know really under relevant at all he's saying don't don't focus uniquely on it or the money again because the what's much more passionate into here is to what you were describing them
people who care about this the anti gun forces
there aren't as many people who are equally men motivated to either of you my maybe you take this first to either of you
i think you're somebody who thinks there should be certain categories of gun regulations common sense regulations around registration around background checks and limits on the kinds of weapons that people can have but there's a politically unrealistic
as far as i can tell so is there anything that you see that can happen and american political life because because big changes in legislation or definitely not going to come at least in that direction that more likely to come and need you know everyone gets a concealed carry permit
direction
is there anything that that the forces who who favor morgan or like regulations can look to or can try to do that isn't legislation i think their state and city based legislation that can happen in fact right i mean let me see there is interesting research come hang connecticut which made it harder to on a gun and misery which made it easier and you see gun deaths
go down and connecticut and that does not happen and misery so i also think that because you know ten to fifteen ten to fifty million americans who are tagamet care so deeply about this and and it's so threatening to the degree that like any limitation
you're not a gun on or and you're not steeped in gun culture i think it's at least for me a little hard to understand why you wouldn't want everyone to have background checks are why you know keeping people who are mentally ill or on the terrorist watch list from owning a gun doesn't seem like something that we could do but people are opposed to those measures feel like you know given any
take a mile that it's this incursion on their personal freedom that's going to end with someone coming to their house and taking are gonna away and given how entrenched that fat of concerns are and how divisive it is politically i'm not sure that we should have a national legislation about it right now or at least like i'm not i'm not sure it's worth the cost
cost of whatever it would be and we already saw this with president obama chime quite desperately to get these kinds of laws passed after new town and nothing happened so california wants to ban everything then they should do it and that's probably the best way to get any actual progress if you believe in these and then but then you do
the question going back to david's point about conceal carry that's where it's the legislation to allow conceal carry to basically be available in all states regardless of what the individual stance has done them that his position where
it does become a national conversation start you know i was going to say
i wonder if there's a reverse psychology play here today so much of what defines people's political belief in this country today because of the the partisan sorting that we've done is that if the other side is forward i'm against it i wonder if there's a if there's a play where the liberals should just massively embrace gun culture like you make gun culture like a lot
uncool liberals but like all the sudden loving it
everyone out buying guns were all getting guns and then it becomes something which no longer becomes part of conservative political identity to be in opposition to it just becomes somebody it's in the fabric of the country
and then and then it and then it becomes them which you can start to regulate because it isn't it
you lower the temperature on it as an issue
well so many would chime in to say that some of the previous gun control measures were in response to the idea that urban african americans had to easy access to guns so that that which is a kind of a version of right actually talking about know you're going to the question of this
this murderer
it's very hard to make sense of it i mean we don't know there is no obvious reason this has happened does it matter whether we call this terrorism or not
so i always this debate leaves me cold i have to like remind myself every single us high and what that the definition of terrorism as i always forget it has to do with intimidating on the country or citizens and also having a political or social objectives i don't we don't need to call someone
on a terrorist can condemn a terrible action like this i'm not really sure what the point isn't because it often gets used in this anti muslim and racist way and then we have to have an argument about why we're only calling person a terrorist a vague call out allah akbar before they shoot it does seem to me like it's
have called a sack and maybe we should just psyched graph it
i think i agree with you there's the animal logical question of terrorism which is and what it actually means and then there's the way it's used in debate where it's one of the tactics you use to highlight what is an important part of the way we every time we have one of these debates about rights and particularly this specific debate about guns we
the exacerbate all of the underlying problems with the reason we can't talk about these issues and but it still never the less important to play with the idea even as a and because it illuminates something that if we were known that this person were islamic terrorist or were
from a particular country of course the reaction would be different
and so what does that mean what does that mean about the way we react to things what does it mean that six days after the san bernardino shooting then candidate trump called for full ban on muslims which is of course of trampling of rights
in the service of safety so if he does that six days after that shooting
how is that different from what people want to do to limit the second amendment rights of americans in response to this violence and and using those comparisons might break loose a little bit of understanding and in that sense
terrorism is kind of may be useful for a minute to think about bad but more often than not it's used as a way to kind of argumentation points and it kind of loses all meaning and it becomes just another ploy and argumentation not something that actually has a specific meaning i don't have a real coherent thought on terrorists terrorism question i do
the thing that i
haunts me about this particular
act of cruelty
is there something that is happening to people and i don't know what else happening to basically to guys to men that makes them think
that it is the right and good thing to to take the misery and pain and loneliness and suffering that they are feeling and export it to something we're doing and society is licensing that is giving people a sense that that's okay or that that's a good thing to do
i don't have any smart thing to say about it but there's something that's gone terribly awry another scary element and this is clippings and haitian that off and media coverage could be playing into their we are in dark decisions fat people make that and they know that that will be you know all of the headlines all of the search for understanding
it's all completely scripted at this point and i don't know what choice we have because it is newsworthy but that is kind of a sickening element here
okay we'll leave it there

hurricane maria is two weeks gone porto rico remains a mess power is out to think still about ninety five percent of the island
and may remain out for some people for up to six months it will certainly remain out for almost everybody for at least a month
most porta rican like clean water food is in short supply crops are wrecked businesses are destroyed as we learned today the pharmaceutical industry which is the biggest export industry in porto rico
has been devastated by this and their shortages of drugs that are looming tourism has vanished
present trump has stopped treating insults at the mayor of san juan and the us government is is finally starting to deploy resources to help the island recover more significant resources to help you out and recover but it's a terrible situation occurs already seventy plus billion dollars in debt to hedge fund the creditors infrastructure
was already a mess
congress is not eager to ship a lot of federal funding toward people and a commonwealth who are citizens to the united states or not you don't vote in elections that elect them are like the president
john is the response that the us as
has displayed towards porto rico a disgrace
impart let me say one of the think quickly first because i think it connects to the previous comment you know the president's choosing at a moment to go after the mayor of san juan because obviously under enormous stress watching people i mean all of the devastation around her and you can imagine that just existence
theory that would come from not getting things for whomever whatever reason to to then in that moment go after her and to has previously initiated this divisive multi day fight over the nfl
when you have something like the shooting in las vegas you one of the many things not the first thing that one of the many things he you realize that for a national leader and for our national conversations you have to budget your outrage and your divisiveness because things are going to come to you by surprise that are going to split the name
and that going to cause incredible pain even by people who aren't directly affected in any way and since you know that's going to happen in one fashion or another you don't go pick fights you don't go make situations worse for their own sake but then you sap the kind of general national energy for when a surprise things had thing happens
porto rico to me is there was obviously the issue which are now quickly turn to it which is itself
important but it also i think has this connection to the other things the other fights the president has chosen to pick in a job where usually you can try to calm fights
i think the question with the puerto rico is it was a it's a special case it's not like texas and florida as you mention it has only infrastructure issues the question for me and evaluating the federal response is and they also had you know you had thousands and thousands of containers full of supplies ready to go but there were only twenty percent of the truckers available the roads were wiped out special case but isn't
we hope isn't the best we hope for a federal response that they have the agility and nimble miss to recognize hey this is different in florida and texas and as a result of it's being different here's the different things weren't going to do and then to master the moment in so in other words all of the difficulties that porto rico as had and that
the collapse inside porto rico that makes this all the more devastating should have been the kind of thing that if we are operating optimal way we'd be saying wow they were amazing and able to adapt to the special conditions of porto rico
add to that the thing they keep taking means that it took them more than a week to name an onsite commander and it was impossible not to feel that there was a void in leadership hear that because of all the power failures and the impossibility of the roads television and because this is puerto rico
oh american television wasn't covering it to the same degree at all as it was true in florida and texas and so it wasn't real to president champ because he wasn't seeing it on tv screens and there's something i'm sorry shocking about that that the person who is privy has the most and best information in the world can't
respond to something and tell he sees it on his tv screen because he just doesn't think that it matters and it's a priority and then when you add on the layer of you know prickly defensive
rat a tat treating at the mayor of san juan
like how dare you question me in order to get help from me you have to kowtow that's also just like a horrifying displayed of anti leadership
do you think that we as a nation oh porto rico the same thing that we go to maryland or to hawaii also an island
yes absolutely and our citizens and also there's a tortured history here of colonization and lay it means to be a commonwealth and why we have a commonwealth that doesn't have electoral votes and representatives in congress
yeah your are you just as willing to pay higher taxes too
to bail out the people of puerto rico's you would be to pay our taxes to bail out the people of massachusetts
yeah and i also think that this is like a nanny
their line by the way i don't believe either line i don't believe do that's why one and wide i'd you feel why our cultural affinity to people like every other state in the nation i also forget cultural event of a human affinity well as a family that people are people are suffering but regular and people are suffering to a greater degree there them they were
would be in states like florida or texas where they have local resources and yet but and haven't been all right i'm i'm glad you could argue you more he should be more than i'm willing to for my nation to provide resources to bail out haiti which is not part of my nation that i would be to bail out god i wouldn't be to see the devastation and and apps of life
that happens to those countries in particular that's what that's part of who we should be as a nation well john i do agree the human suffering there was much greater than anything and he american suffered any american natural disaster but the fact is that we've put tens or hundreds of billions billions of dollars to recover from a sandy
a katrina
northridge earthquake
and i think the numbers that we put in for for other countries were there for a tsunami or for haiti
or trivial in comparison so there's no and i think you would but you were making a separate case you were making so that's a fact which it can be debated on so terms but you were saying that you thought neither of us had the view that we had about one i think i think it's really easy to say in the abstract oh we should we should give as many resources to haiti forget porto rico for a second to her
haiti as we should to new york but i actually don't think that in practice that if any of us were in a deciding role in a position where we had the research of the us government he had to deploy that we would actually act and that way i don't think it because we care less about the people in haiti or because we would be politicians great about lab votes were coming from a mix of both
yeah you care most about the people in haiti because they're not because the nation is was a way we define ourselves
and
and people in new york or we see the more there's more coverage they're closer to us culturally than they would be no i mean if i could have control over my tax dollars are other people's tax dollars i think i would change how they're spending any number of ways and there will be lots more foreign aid and there but apart from of that puerto rico is not a foreign country and puerto rico is the united states
america and sell we should be thinking of it as part of the united states of america and treating it accordingly
a few weeks ago i don't know if you guys remember this but i think was actually before the hurricanes and a brutally about climate change
and
we're talking about how eventually the united states would make a decision
not to rebuild a place that was devastated by climate change and i was i was saying we want miami will just give up on man in believe me i've heard from miami and i understand that you're not happy about that
but i think the day as i think that days here i think that porto rico
is it is as a as a
the territory as a commonwealth we lack the political will to restore porto rico to be what it was we will like the funds to do it porto rico is going to be a poor society than it was there will be more outdoor migration people will leave it it will be it is a place which because of this natural disaster that have happened it is going to be permanently scarred and damage and
the way that i think we're going to see going forward for lots of places in the world and i don't think we will muster the political will to to spend the resources required to to to restore it to health to that's a fascinating question is is what do we know in advance of the next one because presumably you rebuild
put do we go up to you
let's rebuild or you do with miami beach
knowing that there's a greater risk that those two places are going to be hit by by weather and so what do you oh what do you oh when that's the money you're using to build something that's going to get knocked down again when that same money could be used going forward for you know let's say general research into
infectious diseases or whatever other thing in a limited budget that someone that to me isn't is of that's really fascinating question which is separate and apart from that of gray with my else yeah ground which is a separate and apart from what do you do to get them the relief and the emergency care in the wake of disaster
he should do that for the conundrum show
one of the striking things to me about the whole hurricane season we've had is not just the short attention span of president trump and his kind of the way he is john describe it he's miss a lot it is outrage and its energy but all of us that there were not really i don't know what's going on houston used to was suffering from an
natural disaster couple of weeks ago i actually because i'm a disgraceful citizen i'd actually don't know what's going on i can't remember what obama did i don't know if the places that were damaged by our i'm not sure what their recovery is the media attention to porto rico there's been there's been lots of effort and lots of resources but nowhere near what there have been to other
pastors and other situations there's so much horror and frustration the world and
i don't know i'm struck by i'm struck by how quickly our attention of moved in a way that i don't think it did with katrina
he also had i mean in the blunt and cruel and masturbate you just had a great deal more cats and katrina
one hundred people die until that's probably that's should that would be one factor i'm not saying it's a factor but it too
the category is is a little different rate and also with his hurricanes
there's just this massive clean up after a long slog greatest site people's waterlogged houses and the insurance estimates and then rebel dang like news coverage intense news coverage feeds on high drama and the aftermath of a natural disaster if if fair not some huge number of deaths is tons plenty out
it's harder to generate fat it's amazing having studied this further was just stop this week which is about johnson going to go after hurricane betsy nineteen sixty five which is the first kind of presidential moment our president arrives and uses the moment to show leadership in in the night until nineteen sixty five it will happen in nineteen
fifty five and nineteen fifty which are two huge years for hurricanes like record years if you look up and they have their own wikipedia entries
and the front page of the newspapers in are stories about the coming hurricanes and where they're going to hit on the east coast next to stories about eisenhower being on vacation eisenhower he's not in any of the hurricane stories in nineteen fifty five on the front page in the stories about him being on vacation are oh he's out fishing and hunting and these flying from pennsylvania to denver and though isn't that neat there's nobody
saying this is an outrage she's not and then when the hurricanes hit there was no federal response really expected it was basically taking care of by the states and by the red cross and nobody said oh this is an outrage when he went to visit one of the hurricanes
he went to basically say you need to have a civil defence force that can handle these things when they hit not i'm here to help you so
he was just interesting our national response to disaster and how it's changed just that
leave it at that at that it goes really fascinated when was fema have created during carter and even johnson even johnson when he goes to hurricane betsy which hits the ninth ward he's doing it basically and david because you're a fan of lyndon johnson on the phone there's fantastic recordings of him talking to russell long does it basically because russell alone has done
a bunch of favors and sense he's begin to take it and that had taken it in the teeth
for johnson johnson feels he owes him one and so it goes down to the ninth ward basically politics in that case was what was motivating and not the desired be like seen on t v or to be seen as compassionate but then kicked off a chain of events that led to what we have now wow that's amazing
it's fascinating
but it goes back to your point about time and attention of the actual president but also is it a good thing that we all look to the federal government for responding to these things eisenhower's argument was basically it saps something from us at the local level if we just think that thing will happen federal government i would come in to you
the fantastic piece that lay off he wrote maybe seven years ago about been in moscow
when there were fires menacing moscow and it was about what it was like to live in a country where there with no nationally organized response to natural disaster and how terrifying it is and how the idea that we can rely on local or self organization is a canard and that at some point you need some larger authority with resources and a plan
and to help everybody i mean that there can be obviously individual acts of heroism and individual acts of stuff organization but that without this kind of national effort or some kind of large institutional effort that it's terrifying and unbelievably dangerous as a brilliant piece that to era there is a fascinating also little historical site
part of this which is that the civil defense efforts on hurricane preparedness and domestic tornado preparedness and all that were really a way to get people to be in civil defence forces because of the coming invasion by the communists so that it was like prepare for your tornado but really keep yourself fit for when the reds come
we are brat makers and the tried and true apple cider vinegar that you've had having your cabinet far as long as you've had a cabinet
and you trust that model sitting in your cabinet because we were in your mom's and mom's cap
you use this as a wellness drink your mom used this and salad dressing her mom's mom used as this glass cleaner
and while there are many ways to as one thing is always saying our recipe it has never changed since we've been putting cabinets brown it's not nearly think rex
welcome back skoda us justice roberts and the gang got back to work on monday
for what promises to be dramatic term with bad news almost certainly coming for labor unions and workers interested in labor rights uncertainty for those who had gerrymander and those who had bake cakes
emily
let's talk with sort of limit ourselves so the big there's a big case come in which i'm so excited to talk about when it when it gets closer which is the masterpiece bake shop for what it's called big shop masterpiece take shots to peace cake cake shop kate case about the take pick or her didn't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding but bold and i think see
sadly the end of them
save that that's going to eat so many so many questions and thoughts and hypothetical for you can you go spend a week in a bunker preparing i exit but until then let's start with the big case of this week which with guild vs whitford the gerrymander case brief it for us please counsellor wow
fill in clinton there was a census and after every santas we district and this country in the twenty eleven redistricting in the state of wisconsin the republicans controlling the state houses and the governor's office so they put together a what was supposed to be a very secretive process very dry and their maps they had
add some aids kind of squirreled away and room that a law firm yeah the capital and they had help from a political scientist at the university of oklahoma named keith gatti he was hired to create regression analyses and data that would allow the map makers to easily visualize what
would happen depending on how they moved the voters around so basically you know right now if you're trying a map and you're trying to maximize part is an advantage you want to know if you move to hundred republican voters out of their safe distract how safe will remain like how many points why the republicans have to win by state
why it in order to stella maintain this protest distract so you want to be able to see the results of we've elections as well as more standard elections and then make decisions about how you distribute your folks to maximum advantage and then how you usually you're trying to concentrate the other party especially if republicans are doing the job
mandarin you wanna pack as many democratic voters into a smaller number of urban districts are that they're not going to be spread out and for i'm saying other elections or amnesty so the republicans did this whole process there was one day a public hearings that was the moment at which the maps were visible to the democrats to the first time republic
lawmakers had then signing confidentiality agreements and coming to look in the map or am just at their little slice of the map but the democrats only found out about it at this one day a public hearings and then a week later the maps become law in wisconsin and then in the two thousand and twelve elections the republicans when sixty of ninety nine seats with less than fifty percent of the vote
statewide for the state assembly so that is an amazing transfer of power and it basically remains entrenched in two thousand and fourteen and twenty sixteen and by a number of measures of partisan bias this republican map is an outlier and terms of the degree of gerrymandering so the legal context
wow this is that if the hands are republicans were dry and the maps there was really no reason to think they were doing anything illegal because the supreme court has never struck down redistricting map for being too partisan and it's gerrymandering there's a whole body of law about racial gerrymandering that we can talk about but not about gerrymandering about political parties and the question is whether
this case is going to be the moment where the supreme court steps in and allow lower courts to start stepping in as well the state of the law up to this point was that there were four conservative is the last time around which is like two thousand and four and also two thousand and sex who are ready to say that the courts had no role at all its prey and gerrymandering
ever and that these cases should be that's called non justifiable like not something that you get to bring a lawsuit it out but justice kennedy while he upheld the maps in those cases it was not willing to shut the door entirely on these claims and he said he was looking for a workable standard answer the question is whether since span the quake robes
bust development of social science that has talked about partisan bias or what's called partisan a symmetry as crack standard this is different from proportional representation i'm happy to explain why actually figured this out and i was writing about this attempt quite proud of myself about and then there are a bunch of tasks that measure
well a symmetrical are how biased the map is and so at oral argument this week justice kennedy actually didn't ask any questions of the lawyers who are challenging the maps which was interesting and he seemed skeptical of the lawyer for the state of wisconsin and so there was a kind of hope full set of stories and coverage about the
the argument suggesting that may be candy is open to the sparkle standard on the other hand chief justice roberts and justice for such went out of their way to dismiss of the social sciences what roberts called gobbledygook and to basically make it seem as if there was no way the court could ever master this and do a good job of referee in gerrymandering based
on the science that i just have to say is just horse shit there a principal reasons to think that courts shouldn't interfere in these cases but the notion that the science is gobbledygook and that courts can't handle it is just silly the same tools you use to make the maps are the tools the judges can use to assess the maps
now finally stopped talking cannot describe the one little piece how irritating it is when the standards of one call arm when depending on the side of the argument you're on the standard she had just go through completely out the window and so the gobbledygook good point even forget this just in general
just infuriates me in the same way
other issues where people who will search night and day for a workable solution to a problem then when when they're on the other side of the argument though be about too complicated can't do it tramples on rights that's it we're sorry too hard and then least
yes and also science the whole roll of social science or even hard science at the court that's something i've been really interested in for a while because and i've written about it with regard to justice scalia that there's a way english conservatives often are trying to take positions in which the social science is on the other side and so
the market or they belittle it justice scalia famously like at a climate change hearing basically said like i can understand this word i can remember there are some and he met use like i'm not this isn't my specialty there is nothing inherent in conservative philosophy that would make it seem ultra skeptical of science and yet that's what we're seeing
dudley while i think this goes exactly to john's point which is the whole point about the precision of the gerrymandering that it's based on on exactitude that we now it's based on science that demography is much much better ability to measure to geographically locate where people are who they are identified with they are
much much better than a so that it is drugs
both said the fact is that it has science it has given people the tools to create these precise gerrymandered districts and dresses kagan just justice prior made these planted argument it should be said emily so there a couple of conservative i mean there are a number of conservative claims to go after the first one
which i find kind of the most compelling news you know democrats lost themselves the statehouses like really badly even well before these were the as as jury members they are now
they were victims of this gerrymandered map because in wisconsin they couldn't hold the state house and they couldn't hold even though to state where they should run well and it's a political failure on the part of the democratic party to compete and therefore
cost of a political to defeat way wasn't part of the reasons but democrats did so poorly and two thousand and ten in particular had to do with this red map nationwide
project and let republicans or really successful i'm spending money and putting resources into a slate legislative races and good for that and that's how politics works i guess the question is what should the consequences be right i mean when you control the government you get to put your policies in place and sell wisconsin and purple state has in some ways
a bright red set of policies like the union busting a policy is that governor walker has championed and there are other examples and the state as well but do you also get to entrench yourself in power in a way that makes it very hard for the voters to vote you out even when they don't support you like do we want a sister
i'm in which effectively the party that loses in twenty tan than in trenches his health and power for the next ten years because there's a handicap right where i like the loot the the power party that's out of power would have to win by ten points or twelve point or seven points statewide in order
to retake a bare majority and those are real structural issues about that democracy that i think transcend like that kind of whipping the democrats may deserve for having lost all those state house races and twenty and ten
interesting part of this which i think went to the standing issue whether these these people even have the right to challenge the maps as a whole was the first amendment claim i wonder if you could talk about that too broadly speaking the idea that because people are democrats because of their the speech their position
political beliefs they're being discriminated against in some fashion
to back up into in equal protection land we talk about suspect classes people who are being treated differently for reasons of religion or national origin or race or gender and we talk also about immutable characteristics like you can't change those things about yourself and so they deserve special protection you can change your religion but we like first arc or reasons have really
and in that category most of the time we don't think about being a democrat or republican as a protected class fare like a few nibbles around the edges and the law where they are like employment protections for not getting fired for the basis of your political party but mostly we don't think that way the first amendment the area is another way to conceptual lies the case
kind of differential treatment we're talking about where it is true that if your vote is essentially going to be wasted because you're going to be packed into a district that's ninety percent democratic that's happening because of your political beliefs and associations and and so i think that's what kennedy's first amendment theory kind of gaps act but then doesn't that take you right back
to the level and extent to which you're being muted or does it just except since you've been pushed out of because the german during his happened your political view as been
close to me how do you prove that you haven't been given the right to speak
way well that's a good question i mean one of the issues here is usually when you have a legal came claims like an on or off switch like racial gerrymandering and happened or i didn't with political gerrymandering the court has to figure out a way probably to say okay politics are part of redistricting the constitution gives the power to you
district to the legislature so we're trying to set boundaries the best analogy i found when i was writing about this was to box and like the idea that boxing is about people hitting each other we recognise are going to keep hitting but they're also referees and boxing who set boundaries and rules around the boxing so there's like some kind of hitting is off limits
that's the kind of thinking that would have to happen here in order for the court to play player all one of the things that oh
enjoyed reading wrote this her enjoyed but have been
taken by so been reading about it
sometimes this comes actually you've been from republicans who talk about it
is the pernicious effects in the long run of having a highly gerrymandered system and
what it points out is that it means that it just increases the level of mistrust and democracy and about the system
it is one of the causes i think of legislators representatives feeling they could ignore constituents not respond to particular kind of constituents avoid public events avoid hearings and the analogy to the old pocket borough system in england where you represent the district but basically like you were given it it was yours and there was no need to
responsive to the people the whole idea of a republican system where you have a people who represent you is that you were than responsive to those people who represent you know that you have to do everything that they tell you that your elected it's not direct democracy but the you have to be in some sense and responsive to them and if you have these districts where people don't need to be responsive to
a huge class voters it undermines the whole project the long run it's really the corrosive one reason for the supreme court to open this door is that you know the fate of our democracy is at stake to be dramatic about it we have fewer and fewer competitive races and us house and that is not entirely because of gerrymandering because
the big sword the way in which people have moved to increasingly live among people who vote like damn that's a factor here we've talked about that on previous shows the gerrymandering also plays a role and when you have fewer competitive races you have more of a landscape than the one you're talking about david and one that's more polarized and
i think for me it comes back to the hit like right now the republicans are benefiting more from gerrymandering because they can draw more statehouses and look like if there is no remedy maybe they'll kind of permanently hold on to that advantage but there are states in which democrats have also gerrymandered to the same degree and when you
think of the idea that the party that the voters don't support remains in power there's something fundamentally and stuff but that it then you start to really affect that democracy is warping and i think that is one reason why there's a sense of urgency and a reason my this case matters a great deal so before we close on this topic and the finals
john morning
my one final fellow be to remind people that with or without the supreme court states can address gerrymandering they can appoint nonpartisan commissions to do the redistricting themselves and in states like arizona voters have created those commissions through safe referenda so if you're worried about the legislature
too entrenched in its own gerrymandering to do that kind of reform this is something that voters can actually do themselves and it really is it's like the shape of redistricting is not something that usually gets people to march in the streets but it is one of those structural elements that underlies all the decision making

male as good a cocktail chatter and when when you are sitting with a pumpkin spice latte
i spoke with four or five ounces of ever clear what you're going to be and about to their family
the ghost noxious drink is sad because boy do i need a drink this weekend i have actually had our week i know this will embark me as the person at the party everyone will run from but i have to talk about another supreme court case this week where the court heard arguments and it's about whether the federal arbitration
can act can be used in a way that allows players to make their employees sign arbitration clauses in their contracts but then makes it impossible for those in plays to band together to pursue a collective action and so like a collective challenge to a workplace practice
you know this whole thing of these binding arbitration agreements that then force people to divide up their legal claims into tiny little individual places that have no value to any lawyer it's just a real increasing problem and it's a little complicated and i guess little boring but it's so important
i mean if workers are stripped of this way to have collective actions been that means that every time an employer skins that off the top doesn't pay some overtime they're not going to be able to come together in order to address that problem and so we just increasingly have a system where these arbitration clauses are used to allow and players to chew
people out of things you know not huge individual damage claims but across the whole company you can have a lot of people being slightly screwed and essentially a situation in which it's very hard to remedy that it just seems like a real mistake given our current imbalance of power between
in labour and capital and also the course of world when that one for the employer's right exactly and this is just an example of how pro corporate the supreme court has become and with course edge on the court will continue to be a fear john what does your child much enters a month
welcome news that uses official them in the twenty twenty olympic games in tokyo climbers will be able to compete for gold
so they announced that there will be three disciplines climbers will compete in sport bowling in speed climbing
i'm really sorry
very cool if you
our interests in the one of the ways i've come across this is by following climbers on instagram which is which is amazing for seeing the door sport climbers but them people who do competitive climbing indoors just watching them souls bolden puzzles and also than watching speed climbing is amazing it looks
are roaming one horizontal ground
that's good for him that's good news for all of them and for those of you who can then learn about the sports before you get to twenty twenty
running on vertical ground
yeah ending and horizontal ground but it looks like they're just like it looks like the all ogre
clamoring and cross level ground but they're in fact climbing vertically so totally free here
you feel like you you'd be like i can do that because there's no way you somebody could do that such amazing precision like without it being easier than it might otherwise seem and them you try and could do it and knew you were immediately delivered to disappoint is climbing one of these things so i've only done a very little tiny bit and terrible
but it's one of these things which sort of like mountain biking or downhill biking which is if you go faster it's probably better like that could actually going slow takes you out of a rhythm and like that in fact the speed you build up momentum and it gets you going a certain way
i don't know about momentum because the gravity is working against you but i definitely think and this is i haven't actually clone for many years now and a wonderful
do it again just because i'm out of shape but there is a flow because what happens is when you get stock it's a great lesson for life you have to just calm down have perspective and work it like not go only got my arms and life forms are going to cramp
oh my doing this oh my god i'm i'm three hundred feet in the air
everybody's watching like you need to to mellow and if you're in flow you don't know stuff happens usually stooges moving and it's really great and it's amazing to watch i have two chapters this week one and self serving but also serving you your listeners which is if
