once i will cherish those the called on this week scan first that the the you they've been the late for feud exploding between president trump and its former spend golly steve ban and then more twists and turns and swerved and you turned and the rush it investigations
talked about all of them
and then a new report says that fake news does not exist right emily we will talk about that know it didn't really say that but it says it doesn't matter where maybe it is even say that anyone will even be about faith in may not even in this cattle future it may just have been a facebook posting about hillary clinton's one point eight billion
dollar house that she was building which is true
plus what of cocktails chatter and and sleet plus we're going to discuss if college is worth anything if it good for anything so slight plus members get additional bonus segment for free but you can get it by going to sleep dot com slash can of first plus to sign up for slate plus
so we learn some really interesting things this week learned that was an air quotes
don't did not want to win the presidency and didn't expect to win the presidency jared kushner vodka trump have a packed in which only one of them can run for president and it will be her steve ban in called the meeting in which done at junior brought some russians and to trump tower treason us and unpatriotic and then said
quote they will crack down junior like an egg on national television
donald trump's own best friend as well as rupert murdoch are quoted as calling him an idiot or maybe a fucking idiot
i may be fucking stupid i can't remember exactly what the phrase was but you get the tenor of it donald trump responded to a suggestion that point john bain earth as chief of staff by saying who's that who's john boehner these revelations or perhaps something or other in michael wolf's wolf's new book about the dawn of the term presidency fire and
fury have prompted an enormous an incredible response
the first response is come from donald trump himself who wrote exceedingly angry
note about steve ban and saying that when steve ban and lost his job he lost his mind
steve then and then also lost his funding for the mergers had been funding has bright bird operation and then there's been a lot of discussion about whether what wolf is reported is even possibly true it
the quotes accurate are these competitions conversations that could really have occurred to trump really see the things that he attributed in this book so john dickerson first of all should we believe this book
going to get her no context for michael wolff and his reputation right not to interrupt yeah sure let's get that for john should we believe this book
emily i'll leave emulated to offer the context because i think
well i'll leave it to her so
i think there very individual details on it it's interesting i think what might be able to say about this book is what i often feel like is possible to say about president trump and his connection with his voters which is the facts may be in dispute but the truth of it is right
which is that the president supporters often said i don't care of that he doesn't tell the truth or is just gets facts wrong there is a thrust of him that i like that i want to correspond to and align myself with and i think this book represents a description of a white house in chaos
whipsawed buddy the impulses if the president and in which there's a lot of back stabbing front stabbing rake stepping
our should say stepping on breaks that all has been fleshed out he and other accounts
i certainly know it from my conversations with people in the white house and people who have witnessed the white house there are appointed moments which are interesting and we should talk about by while we assess those we need to also recognize that this does echo a lot of other things we've heard and also in the response to add both in the response to the book and to
ban the impulsive
kind of chaotic response in which the president says you know about steve ban and
what did you say steve van and has nothing he has nothing to do very little to do with our historic victory owner know that but they but he start he he he said it it beginning of that statement said steep and it has nothing to do with me or my presidency and that odyssey isn't true
and so and then he says a variety of other things in both the statement about ban and in and the white house statement about the book that aren't true that if they aren't directly to their massively distorted span all of which echoes in apart what is described in the block
which is a white house in which the president creates and a campaign which he creates his on reality and in which advisers to shape that reality go through an extraordinary series of back bands and
rivers in that context it's it feels a piece of what we've come to understand that the trump white house like and then we have to assess those individual stories some emily
what makes you doubt about the veracity of particular stories in this so my go off has a reputation for taking quote from getting accused of not having them on the record and ranks and a floating your party and talking to people and gossipy ray recreating full if you were there so i don't know
i said i feel like i'm not binary in the read really trust our right scene setting part of bad but the notion that people are turning on the champ administration and aren't aren't themselves and being brutal and their discussion interact little how will handle the beginning of the presidency scene and right
for the moment at least that's what we got this
at in the that a brawl episode and right about running reality t we shall return returned administration
state than this are carry all
it's puzzling think it's going to have a big great but the president and of course they're going to get back together at father later and it just seems so ginned up like both true and also overwrought john
do you think that this is as them says just another episode and that that bannon and trump will be the fifth one of these days
or is it is split that has actual significance by the political or emotional i think the ban and trump part of it is actually the least interesting i think that the the these two figures don't follow the normal patterns of of human relationships of politics of public life so they
bounce in and out of both affection and antipathy what strikes me about this book is the central claim from wolf is that
people are right around the president are i think he says one hundred percent certain that he cannot do the job there are people who privately or on the president sod some of whom were standing behind him at the tax cuts ceremony the white house testifying to what an extraordinary president he is
if that trend continues and day it comes to pass that people decide this is true and that he cannot do the job i'm not saying it is true but if it comes to pass that it is true and there are those who has sold privately that it is true how will they have going to work out for them that they had this feeling about the president and they didn't do anything
about it either
worked inside the white house or publicly on the other hand if this is being said about the president and it's not deserved then it's and then we shouldn't be taking what wolf is writing as gospel nobody should want this kind of thing to be seen as gospel because you can basically smear a person and a white house because people just have an appetite for the
yes
well although it's very intimate have any countervailing evidence that he is up to the job there's nothing that he's done there's nothing that he said there's nothing is written there's no stories that are told about him privately by anybody that suggests just so that goes back to my first the first of the two options that i presented which is if that's the case
then there are a lot of people who had first hand
witness of this who are in congress with the leaders of congress and who have chosen not to doing it well yeah i mean it does seem like our readers of congress should be the most optimal crock as now watching us and yet they have their own political calculations to make sell when you look at of
public and political dimension of death that and has been trying to play a role in republican primaries riot and terrifying of the republican party the idea was that rape art was a kingmaker like rape or got behind certain people this is certainly true about that rise of jeff sessions and made a differ
friends and their profile and and are signaling the right wing populism that was helpful to chop it doesn't look like grape or with a drying that support i mean it was like credit tame and rape dot com has all this book nonsense was breaking so maybe it fell through to be a kind of paper tiger
at this point
republican establishment was rejoicing on on wednesday night is all this was coming out senators were saying right on and mitch mcconnell with saying that trump or is exactly right and denounce denunciation of ban and etc does any of that matter
well the split in the party that by the way gave rise to trump in the first place doesn't go away because of this episode that's why i think longer lasting part of it's interesting about this book is know whether it's true or not wolves claim that the president who used to repeat stories over thirty minutes now repeat them in course of five minutes
and there's a lot in the book that is that goes to this growing question about his competency and that's gotta be again of question first raised most prominently by the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee the claim is it used to be trump is always somebody who talked about himself told stories about himself and they would repeat cycles of thirty minutes and now it's their repeat
i'm also a five minute suggesting some mental compromise that society and then
that's the suggestion of the book and there are a number of suggestions
a hollywood reporter
excerpt of the reporting on the book because the book itself hasn't actually come out yet so there was the new york magazine piece that was an excerpt of the book then there's been reporting about the book and this i'm getting from a hollywood reporter reported that the book so there are claims in the book on this front
was one line i read the other day
talking about the immediate disassociated people have made with ben and the the glee that you talked about with a republican senators the fact that the mercer scene or maybe deep defending him and they take that series of events to signal
to to argue that this shows why it's so hard for anyone to bring drinks break ranks and the republican party that as soon as you do any rank breaking you are exposed to a loss of income a lot of support that that it's become a party which has only allows a certain limited
of views and they require full throated support of the president and all times and that you can't be an iconoclast doesn't seem right to you
narrow reading and the then and is an exceptional figure i mean bad oh weird ways like a firecracker going off and brian who felt like why would it be a good idea for hadn't savings incredibly and something and demeaning things about people on the president family to that wine
that lot of
you know rather than layers trials harder were happens to be also lawyer
a higher tech hello gawk are in sending cease and desist letters and ban and and got confidentiality clause and sign when he trying to counter pain i have no idea whether that contract surprised that and service in the white house as a person that campaign but we'll just have this specter or here i don't understand this particular ask
back bannon because it just seems like not and his interest except that it gets him a lot of attention and maybe he is just as to bad as donald trump as right and conveys he said he said
street fighter take no prisoners says what's on his mind
person which people has in the president's case elevated in the priority list of personal attributes above above all others one of the things that steve ban and is quoted on the record as saying in the book is this stuff about the about done junior and treason and that meeting that he took with a lawyer who
is represented as having dirt on hillary clinton and represented as coming from the russian government and in saying that that meeting was treason is at the same time the president saying this is a witch hunt there's no proof of collusion to have a quote from his former chief strategist saying that they should have taken it to the f b i is a significant development yeah that's the part i don't get him
on the safety bad and really really despise yeah any vodka and i can see the parochial called half in going after that and is like a global but
the invasion of treason sealed
yes the fact when the self destructive part surprised me
it it is a little bit battle of stalingrad here like you want everyone to lose jared and avant can really seem appalling then and it's appalling they're all appalling trump is obviously the most appalling and all but it's it's a battle and which all sides should should come out good and bloodied and with their population starving that would be better
the
one thing that i know this isn't really question it's just a weird phenomenon of the trump administration
is how many narcissus there are who are part of this administration when you think about it scare me
the carter page ban and trump himself these are people who are court region
clinical narcissistic and i don't recall that it's been a phenomenon of other white house which i guess because people tend to be more public service mind in the matter with the trump the administration
it does seem to mean remarkable in there have been people will for henry kissinger i think as a raging artist and certainly had to find career as a white house advisor brilliant
predominantly there had been in the absence of marriage
the ratio of rip but the ratio of narcissus to to regular people and the tramp administration too much higher than any administration i can recall before
can i go back to a point on i think we're making earlier which really about the president and bring with them at twenty fifth amendment we haven't been top ryan i've done this show that much money and that meant that other commentators have been wondering about it for a while and it's not the most clearly and straightforwardly written
part of the constitution i would argue but it does make found her measurements for gearing with a disability and the president and i've been reluctant to see it as a real honor
i like escape route for the country because it has a kind of era of a cool about it and one imagine that it was written
in a coma but
was after way one imagine in fact it was so i don't know how you would apply it i still feel that way about as president the twenty of them and and created after woodrow wilson collapsed in pueblo colorado and lift the last seventeen months of his presidency basically with his wife running the presidency and he
recovering from actually didn't collapse i think he had the stroke after he left the stage but so is you say it does seem like it's something for where they're physically incapacitated
and one of the river i've been thinking that is it seemed like a lot of president it's mental attributes were extremely clear vividly floor agree upon asked when he was elected and so that makes it harder to make the argument that anything has really changed but i suppose what you said about like a thirty minute versus five minutes psychotherapeutic star
might suggest otherwise
and also because people were rolling out the twenty fifth amendment
on your emptiness say overstating the getting no longer
and so which has always been the argument against hyperbole from second one because then if you have a case in which people who i mean in this case wouldn't emily it i mean it would require buy in from republican leaders which is also the other robbie so huge hurdle here
essentially it relies on the vice president to ram and we've just again we should know we've just seen the greatest collective affirmation of the president's skills
and talons by both by the vice president by the majority leader by though
well basically the entire leadership of the house and senate on the republican party just publicly testified not just to the greatness of the tax cut but specifically the talents of the president the sustain talents the in public and private of his office
so that always happens when dictatorships right before the coup
the very sick offense the courtiers know the ones who end up
doing the doing the dirty deed anyway so i wouldn't wait but that may much on the their public statements as matter if and decided they want to do it i don't think an advantage
the way that the data make pants frets it's going to be scary to watch it happen
like it's going to feel like a dictatorship it's gonna be like you know newspeak like make a will and we're in the syntax we're in the lymph nodes and a half we are nearing the end of escort but since we in that lamb
that's the sound of the testicle limb and which things won't come to pass happen
don't you think emily that because the barriers are so high as they rightfully should be to overturn the will of the people that were it to come to pass the ascension by the vice president would almost be pro forma because what whatever will have happened will have been so public and so hand forcing that
that it actually that it will be just like okay everybody goes through the steps i mean and it would require a president
let's take it outside of the specific for a moment in a situation in which the president's party controls both houses of congress it will require a president to actually collapse and be medically
could diagnose i think the bigger question is can they figure out a way not to get him to run for a second term so that a the country doesn't have to suffer through this be he doesn't have to continue to a job for which you obviously have a quick and see they don't have to be strapped him and twenty twenty which i don't think they
want to be that's the hard part when you're dealing with somebody who isn't narcissistic and ego driven is trumpets can can he be veered on to another course
because they're not they are not going to question they're not going to depose play

the russia investigation or investigations swerved and veered again over the past several weeks reports suggest to the house
inquiry into russian election meddling is nearing some kind of conclusion with huge divisions between the committee republicans or democrats and the possibility of to reports been issued one of the huge divisions is over the question of whether as the republicans would like to whether to focus on
misdeeds of democrats are possible misdeeds of the f b i and of course if it's own investigation is whether that should be a focus that's one big question their other big questions about whether all the when witnesses have been talked to and subpoenaed meanwhile we have an overall stepping up of attacks on the f b i from some republican
and stepping up of attacks on the independence of robert moeller there appear to be efforts to undermine mahler's steep investigation to the trump campaign
and then a third sort of threat of all of this is there now new york times is reporting that the impetus or one original impetus for the f b i a few should trump appears to be the loose lips of george papadopoulos who drunk blob the to an australian diplomat about dirt that the term campaign had on
from russians about the clinton campaign
so in the point of this papadopoulos mine if it encounters the the previous argument that servers were making that it was this democratic funded steel dots that had instigated f b i interest anyway there a lot of different threads going on here emily any one of which you pull and you end up
three weeks later
drunk in new mexico like unsure where you got there how you got there and with a body of a dead russian agent line on top of you so or as i like to call it the weekend
so what why is this house investigation wrap up why is that important why does it matter there's so many other investigations why does it matter that the the house investigation is wrapping up quickly and there's some disagreement over it i mean it's an embarrassment for our as stands
that's not credible jaw dropping back and this question which you know should not be drenched part is then division that is about whether the russians never been more action and how safe are electoral process as a real old for acts time not spent just absurd
by that's fine that seems like devon in california congress man who has been in particular are re obstructionist and impossible in august at one point he is anger and ethics investigation under any was clear and he never really gave up and told me it just seems like an embarrassment all around and adam shephard ankle democrat has tried
hard to at least make public and transparent
is not during but it just seems as i myself were given up on it more and more her at are running feel that if we're ever going to really understand what happened is gonna be hard like robert our and
has continued to work and every day that i wake up and he lost his job as a good day and right i don't know what he going to find and i think it's i don't care whatever it is i just want to finish but it is very hard to imagine that private i'm trapped as gonna rat robert mahler and day numbers and his family and
one theory that is a palpably on the table now these committees we're supposed to deal with the question of russian interference in the election how it happened how to stop it from happening where the failures were in the intelligence committee so that's one substantive part of the work that they were supposed to do which separate and apart from the investigated part
is really important and if they don't do that is a real failure because you have that's one in which you have this bipartisan consensus that it needs to be done
then you get to the political question which is to have they been doing and are they even able to do the kind of investigative work that this requires which was always
trouble troubling because these are not investigators and sell it it was always going to be difficult to send it's doing a better job than the house but i feel like i come back to a point i was making in the previous conversation which is at the end of the day there is going to be muller's going to produce something and that will be the fact record against
which the performance of the congress will be measured and so both the specific members of the committee who said and believes in various things will have something against which to measure and their leaders who allow them to do or not do what they're supposed to do in these
in these committees will be on the hook for not letting them go forward and finding true wrong doing or laden go too far because mother comes out and says well there's nothing here there's gonna be a day of reckoning why do you guys think
both have you discussed what is the critical issue
in this investigation or all these investigation which is that you have a hostile foreign government engage in what appears to be an incredibly successful campaign to disrupt mislead propagandize confuse interfere with the integrity of an american election and
completely independent of any possible collusion that there might have been between present terms campaign and any russians there's very little doubt that this was an enormous effort by a hostile foreign government which has had a cascade of really detrimental effects on american democracy
and it is sad
and i don't think this is just the republicans
playing possum on i also feel like democrats because if so focused on collusion have also had bear some culpability here it is really sad that there isn't a deeper national outrage and consensus and work to try to understand what was done and fight what was done and ensure that doesn't happen again and that the these all these investigations have lost
last the trail which is that that is the path that's the thing they should care about why do you think it is that they've done such a poor job of interesting american than even interesting themselves
in this fundamental question because there was no way to talk about that but didn't make president trump interact and angry bear and a cane a questioned integrity and legitimacy and his electoral victory which had their things the most driven at our republicans are spa
farming time had no way to ask those questions that felt reddit great faith to them and sell it in math fan and i guess you can throw over democrats under the bass chair for obsessing over courage and but i don't really think that's right the main shell here
i wonder about is whether
every election is different and guess the russians will be back as i think james clapper was famously said but they'll be back in some different way that the technology morphs and that what just as important as understanding what happened is figuring out what they're likely to do next one thing that bothers me tremendously is that no
nobody's really talk seriously or maybe that's an exaggeration but i don't see on the horizon legislation about trying to change the way political ads online are regulated which seems like such a key part of this that all of this on some of it was fake postings but some of it was paid for advertising met wasn't subjects any of the room
we have for political ads
those sorts of things kind of swirling around or what bottom me the most about us
i have three things
first is the topic that nice story gonna do your point do that of sums what the president still is reluctant to admit i'm rushing which denies which is that the republicans the russians were actively trying to push this dirt on ritalin which later came out through wiki leaks we also know that from home the meeting
we have strong evidence that that was the that they were trying to find him and true point in this meeting a trump tower with the president's son so in addition the other things that the bump it up his story in the new your time shows including by the way the other thing that it shows that there are some conflict between the new york times reporting at the time which said there was no evidence of any connection between
trump campaign and russia now they're near times reporting that the f b i did have that have that evidence and was and was curious about it and investigating it and that's now peasants in part where we are today but that's one thing about that story is that it shows that this was in fact the russians were up to this not that we need any more evidence of that based on the months and months and
in which intelligence officials past and present have had present have claimed that but it's just learning this piece of the story tells us that other thing i think emily's right about the collusion and the you're both right actually there has been an excessive focus on collusion in kind of sloppy way you know the obstruction story has police to me been
dynamic and more explosive because it's the one in which the president plays a role nobody's ever put the president in the center of the drama on the collusion question and the final point i would make it and will maybe we should just wait and talk about this in the next topic but i guess i'll do that oh wait till the next to a certain point when everybody why we know they're they're going to have to wait no but she
she has a response to perception of the things we can forget about money laundering because both and papadopoulos story and and other writing this week and then paul man for discussion and what's going on money laundering is looming large that's also true about the michael wolff and the ban a trial but this investigation is about
and that is the kind of thread that could be playing on where they're reporting a subpoena deutsche bank records that is a tantalizing peace and best it's just that seems like a direction in which this investigation can go that could forget the president
jared kushner and donald trump junior who knows but
oh hey a tantalizing out there to be a two two points on that one the money laundering of course makes sense because they didn't expect to win the election if you don't expect to win the election for them bleed planning for what you're going to get out of having run
do know that trump is constantly looking to gain some kind of edge there and money laundering getting himself advantage on some sort of deals is presumably think you would look for one point i want to make about the papadopoulos story overall and the and how it connects to the collusion allegations which is if they were colluding
and i think they were i think they were think it's such a bad job
which is that you have this kind of know nobody nick
papadopoulos going he let's not that's a little two months on the ben carson campaign
it does not make him a nobody mic and he any find some some random academic some path baked academic with some big time
malta or something cypress melissa
i think i with with a day of google lane and a couple of phone calls could find somebody better to collude with within the industry who no no no russians no no russian think just a little bit of basic collusion google mean would have would have gotten a better said of outcomes are better time
attacks it just seems like he's gone about it and really dumb how fast where i totally agree i've always felt like the biggest obstacle to collusion is just how she symbolic it has all seemed kind of on both hands and while they would this was obviously a campaign that was highly disorganized and was pulling from quarter's that had not
not because most of the republican establishment had fled and was fleeing from donald trump still just as a kind of i mean they were able to do lots and lots of things including win the nomination and you'd think if they were colluding they would have been it would have been a little bit more present also some of the meetings and then later took place during the transition
happened in a way where there was no like you it was like getting to know you meetings which you presume wouldn't have happened if there was already collusion going on away but the rebuttal to that is well we haven't seen what the data analytics people are doing and that and then if there was a relationship there to trade information to try to connect russians with the targeting and
tapping the campaign itself was doing that that might not have been known by everybody and maybe it kind of collusion that leave yet to see so maybe there's a it but i totally agree with you did it like that we sort of assume some level of coordination and like it's how i have also like why are the russians continually trying with different people
i clearly they're knocking on eight different doors ten times and if there's this smooth glide path that they've all figured out why bother
i think it's entirely likely that different people were doing different things
no and yeah anyway
a total it yes totally continues to amaze me that none of them could very well like that
every particular episode we hear of has a has a keystone cops quality to it that is surprising that you think you feel like if if if you feel like of the term for the obama campaign
why in her sleep plus segment on his can't why his college necessary collusion is really only taught at some of your more esoteric most esoteric liberal arts institutions and really the the draw down in collusion education has been one of the told was all because they're doing scam and the day
answer and it's a real problem in humanity i mean market majors are sure

okay moving on comes this week a very interesting study by political scientist andrew deaths brenda nine and jason rae floor have been pronouncing her husband jason about fake news so the three political scientists examined web traffic data collected from
a national sample of americans from october seventh november fourteenth twenty sixteen so in the heart of the presidential election campaign
in order to see what kind of fake news consumption there was which platforms help spread it and they had some very interesting findings so apparently fake news doesn't matter right emily
what was the idea wide but shallow impact so lot
and it's and you didn't like it here
isn't that the line
whose line and thought about he's like the the river of his great home state of nebraska of the river thames student in africa my way than three thousand miles wide and several inches deep
it's a great loan and battle
her failed idea ideas a significant percentage of the electorate is exposed to fake news but it's a tiny percentage of their overall news diet sell it looks like it doesn't matter a whole lotta at least that people have lots of other information coming and so that was one of the defining paper by
and brandon nyhan at dartmouth and account barnacles colleagues
but then another
less cherry reassuring finding was that when people do we go to fake news sites on facebook they don't often see a fact check or at least the researchers couldn't find any evidence that bad and directly seeing a fact check that would refute that make news so the problems going on in the way that
facebook and spreading they seem like they are significant alliance
looks like monkeying around or whatever it's james i don't think we can trust facebook too seriously address the problem i guess what i wonder about this is whether to thing so one thing i worry about is that the real problem with fake news and bennett just because of puff of smoke in which everyone who is despite
to not like a piece of real news says well maybe not true and there's just of destabilization are reporting and information going on that as what to do with the term and it's obsessive you thin trump is you know does this all the time and so that's the real concerns so that's like right one and then i guess point two
whether a fake news has an effect it's because people are already primed by mostly right wing media but sometimes left wing conspiracy media to believe whatever the little drop or fake news isn't it just adds a little extra hot sauce so this obviously has effects with
respect to the pizza gate you know that the fake news sent somebody with an automatic rifle to
to find the pedophilia ring in the basement of a pizza place in washington dc that doesn't even have a basement so there's that a fact which is real which is outside of the election the election effect
i saw some coverage of the suggesting well maybe then this whole russian thing is overblown i think that obviously leaves out to pieces at least two pieces one the wiki leaks
russia inspired wiki leaks dump had a huge effect on the election and that wasn't that's not under the category of fake news that's that to me is what does the more and this is what i was gonna mentioned in our previous topic and that's the bigger danger
to our democracy and our election which is that the russians didn't it wasn't so much fake news that they had to deal as they took advantage of both real news and are the way we cover news in the way we cover elections to have an effect on the election in the way and the way it was covered and i think that you could argue and perhaps i will argue perhaps i am now
currently arguing that the most important thing that we could do to fix the way we go through elections is to change the proportionality with which we assess candidates and events in elections which has obviously been something that i've spent quite a lot of time banging on about over the years but if we had a better understanding of the presidency and what we need our president's to do
and and reported a little of that into the actual campaign process maybe we wouldn't be susceptible to the flashy but not
totally dominant stories that the russians clearly took advantage of with wiki leaks has lime i fell for that extreme goo goo goo philosophy of john dickerson i want to quit points one is just too also
double down on what you said a second ago family which is that the problem of fake news is not the existence of the story themselves fit it the way allows politicians and voters and general to call into question
truth and it contaminates media trust generally people stop believing anything they don't want to believe because it's so that becomes the charge that can be thrown at it and so that's the bigger problem is not so much that they're convinced by the dumb fake news stories that allows them to dismiss factual stories that are contrary to police
a dispute
the second thing question i'm interested in is why do you think it is and i have a theory about this
the fake news as a category of information is false stories exists for politics and entertainment but it basically doesn't exist in sports
very little in financial news and not and things like the weather
there isn't fake weather news right people well that people have a long time blamed the weather for the unpredictability and margin of error in whether they said oh you said there was going to rain and whether men would say well no i said there was a so there no
there's no industry somebody i don't change what climate changes different climate change is different climate is different i'm talking about whether i'm talking about and i think the climate is different from whether i think id i think that i think i think i think the key things there are in weather in the immediate weather forecast in finance and in sports people essentially have money riding on there yeah
any and therefore the the value of having actually accurate trusted information is extremely high whereas in politics and in entertainment people their entertainment followed for sport mostly even if inaccurate political information doesn't affect your business life it doesn't affect
but don't cross the i'm going to plan your day
but not directly yeah
i would add i would i would shave off just a few percentage points to what you're saying which is it certainly i remember from covering business
which was some time ago but lots and lots of people in business would say the coverage of this is awful now that's different than what you're saying which is like the actual production of fake news
but but i would say
that there is i mean there's not there's super precision and there is a lot of like fraud and monkeying with balance sheets and stuff the companies do to make themselves look better monkeying with car companies that monkey with their with their emissions standards and all that so
but i think the your general point which is that the the stakes are higher for precision
is true
and then i guess the other obvious trying to make about the weather sport
you can actually see the results immediately right
when i mean every day
all to let are all dead and small boy am i know i think good
in fact
oh and when the radio outside my window right now and i iraq and to be separate
approximately every two hours one pennsylvania and downs in the trunk of the gas
left on mondays
in
every second counts
the life
i visited
of the night
people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars okay let's get a cocktail chatter i bought myself some moonshine which i've never bought before real moonshine or were like the new stuff that take home and i'm shirts the new stuff they called me and because of a solid a farmer's market
but it
it's delicious it's sweater
why isn't why is moonshine john i feel like because you're an alcoholic fake on and on another
either unfair are perfectly accurate way the moonshine similar to vodka
it's clear and kind of tasteless like like well it's oh well i so the only fake posture i'll take on this is that my the late beloved wonderful man dickie sharp lose my wife's uncle gave us some actual moonshine many many years ago
oh and uncle bobby his brother brought a some of i think i remember it's actual me china or the stuff they sell in in stores but that stuff
tasted that it was you drink it and you you you can't swallow it immediately
basically the kind of stuff that i mean it in this case we didn't drink enough to find out but you know home distilled the stuff that may used to make people go blind
so that had a very strong that was not like vodka that was more it felt more to me like you know like scotch or or maybe it's just my reaction scotch but
yeah that's that's that's just have you don't bring near an open flame
if i'm blind next week
yeah we know so we had is probably smoother did it very much more than fairytale yeah yeah so what is your moon moon china
so my moonshine or is that is about the
nigerian prince michael and he you so new maybe he resides in in louisiana in a town of louisiana any of course is not from nigeria by he he's facing two hundred and sixty nine counts of wire fraud and one count of money laundering he's a sixty seven year old louisiana man and he is your
or nigerian official who claims that he's been the beneficiary of a will and the he'll get a million dollars if you send him your bank account and some moonshine and
anyway he is he was busted after an eighteen month investigation as one of those nigerian princes that we've all heard from in our email inbox he lives thirty three miles northeast of new orleans and i will
your money and her multiply it clear a game is still on it's just slightly changed the parameters he's got a million dollars but is temporarily and disposed and need you to hold onto it for a little while before he's able to be at liberty again
i thought a lot of those you're in in printers were actually nigerians or west african that leaves just i'm disappointed your printer aerial nigerians you don't necessarily royalty not rotate finley emily
when you're having your moonshine and coke as you do every year every couple hours what would you betrayed you know i read two really good books over break salvage the bonds and thing and guy and same by just one word if you have not read either books i really recommend it's real and while after the other they're both short they sort of
speak to each other a with like a great week
so guarantee that i and
paying attention can't lead to two story is this mean that we didn't have an one is this threat to the census that the justice department is talking about adding a question asking people about citizenship which like every single person has ever worked on offenses are sense or studied it says it's really depressed results that people were documented or answer
are we won't get an accurate count or end up having to spend hundreds of millions more dollars trying to make up for it it's just like a puny it is and anti immigrant proposal on i really really hope dies a correct dac also really interesting and fun my is commission on voter integrity or whatever ridiculous jumped
his name and that it had it suddenly tank this week in the middle of the steam banning news maybe because it was added on steam bad and bad but it wasn't really a theme ban and shell was a chris kovacs a while some of the people who have been the most addicted to that voter fraud net
and then there was a lot of celebration of the end of best condition which didn't accomplish anything and was a god by eight million lost it a lot of controversy and just at our ham handed from day one but the idea in this order trump sign to send its work over the department of homeland security and i agree with the secretary of
of main reason this commission that that is a really alarming proposition because we will not know exactly what is going on over at the age ass in terms of days ideas of cross checking voter rolls and purging people and potentially discriminating against people with foreigners on surnames which is something that has happened and states like florida so
i think it's really important to just keep watching that at one point chris call back was flooded as a name for some under secretary position over at the department of homeland security and that seems like a really bad place for this whole strain of voter suppression to go
