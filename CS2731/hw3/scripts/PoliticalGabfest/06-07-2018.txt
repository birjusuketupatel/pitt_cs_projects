about your we're we're lucky i know why i'm not a good mood
like two minutes ago we are now that's a smiling only available on a new haven
john dickerson in new york
this morning hello
oh david who i'm laying on the streets gap as president trump latest extraordinary claim that he can pardon him self and other legal shenanigans of the week then how big a deal with the masterpiece cake shop or lane from the supreme court
then could former president bill clinton please shut up
whilst we will have cocktail chatter
and before we get started a reminder that we have a live show coming up in philadelphia and why eighteenth wednesday at seven thirty pm slate dot com slash lived to get tickets to the keswick theater in clan side were hoping to have a really great guest which i thought you could announce today
but we don't
yesterday announced but hopefully
so but i'm guarantee they'll be a great guest come and join us in philly on we love to see the like dot com slash live for tickets present trump who loves nothing so much as the imperial powers
the presidency has he asserted several emphatically this week
and in early two thousand and eighteen letter to robert moeller the president lawyers had asserted that he could not obstruct justice because essentially he is justice that since he supervises the department of justice
he has absolute unitary power to start and stop any investigation for any reason and therefore you could possibly obstruct any investigation
later on twitter he asserted with supreme confidence that he has the right to pardon himself and constitutional scholars agree with this this occurred against the backdrop of other interesting developments
the mall or asking and paul man fourth bail to be
i wasn't exactly sure what he's asking to his house to address house arrest to contain yeah because because metaphor
is accused of tampering with witnesses against him and also against the backdrop of the president pardon mean the next to sousa and handy it other person's of celebrities convicted of crimes similar to those muller's investigating
so let's start with the the to astonishing claims about the power of the president that the president made what is the consensus about how true claims are does the president have those powers is is does the president have absolute power of all department of justice investigations and must can out of struck them and does he have the power to pardon himself the consent
we don't know the answer that these are unsettled questions anti american line the formal sense the supreme court has resolve them i think we all thought that we knew the answer is politically that a president would not dare to even broach the topic of doing such things that because it presents the president as being
above the law and that no president would want to put him in south in the political position of courting this question at least since watergate and we didn't have to worry about it the now of course it's front and center and i think what we're seeing is chump quite successfully controlling or at least trying to
controlled the terms of the debate
making the question about what is legal and what is like clearly the law versus what his behavior obviously should be under any set of no arms that we would want to live by
one of the more amazing developments and my mind was later in the week paul ryan said that he didn't believe in these allegations that trumps been reading about that the f b i spied on his campaign
and both he and mcconnell have taken the position that obviously the president wouldn't department himself as this way of like pretending there isn't a real controversy but anyway what amazed me and so ryan i think was showing a little stein and then not gets freshman republican congressmen immediately when
on fox and excoriated ryan and talked about removing him from the leadership and so there's an argument going on within the republican party about whether the party stands for trump pure trump or for rule of law principles that are broader than that and it's pretty astonishing that that would be there are
monster i i think
new
trying to separate those two things because i think you can tell me if i'm crazy about this but
the debate about the unitary executive has at least some
scholarly adherents they people may argue that they're right or wrong but there is there is this theory and jay secular has been offering that series since the nanosecond the whole me saying coming question and the and the debate over what was center wasn't settlement fourteen to february in the oval office the media i came out secular
was pointing to this notion of the unitary executive and the fact that the president can find her anybody wants to is to getting something within the executive branch because he's the executive sense that the the idea and not that fat right right
use it has some again you mean i agree with that it has some group of adherence who have law degrees and read the constitution away when i think is important event with paul ryan said about this
what the president's calling a spine other we were going on the phone and but which seems to be a complete fabrication
is not only has ronan seen some of the information the president has not been ryan is part of the gang of aid was given access tray gowdy saw this information from behind and both said there that what the president asserted again because it hadn't looked at it he was just basing it on
well who knows what he's basing home but he was not basing it on the fact assorted something that that is that is untrue and so ryan has said this isn't true tree ghandi
you know who determine the government oversight committee has said that not only use their own no evidence of what the president was claiming but that in his estimation with the f b i was doing with respect to this specific informant was looking into whether the russians had tried to meddle in the election which turned out he said on cbs this morning
was in fact doing exactly would present and trump had supposedly said he wanted when anyone that his conversations with james call me which is that he wanted if there was any evidence of anybody doing anything in his campaign with respect to the russians he wanted it investigated mcconnell looked at the same information and said he had full faith in muller's investigation
this is three leaders on the republican side in congress all saying that this assertion the president is totally untrue didn't richard bear throw and his allow them to their
i hadn't seen that but that seems consistent with his behavior so on one and you have a debatable point on the other you have been uncovered as a fiction a fiction brought into the consciousness not by anybody other than the president now that's been knocked down by three or four big leaders that's a big deal so back to the quest
the unitary executive emily is it in the star case with clinton was it he couldn't assert this even if you wanted to because star was appointed by the judicial branch based on a legislative piece of legislation night so you so he was outside the executive is that why clinton could never have claimed this guess it is true
that at the time of the star appointment we had the special counsel act which came out of watergate which created a three judge panel on that appointed special councils and so they were still kind of partly in the executive branch in the justice department that they kind of had one foot out of it on there
all these questions about whether that arrangement was constitutional on this arrangement was the one we've devolved to after members of congress past administrations got tired of special councils and started seeing them as like these creatures run amok who were just causing a lot of distraction so mahler is
both feet planted in the executive branch and the justice department and yes that is why this theory that of the unitary executive by which i think you mean that the president because he can hire and fire everyone in the executive branch he controls everything that's where it comes around the problem with trumps a theory of i can do whatever i
i want is that it assumes he can do whatever he wants no matter what his intentions and so you're seeing that kind of dismissal of all the parts of the statute that talk about corrupt and ten like if you're trying to block and investigation of your own campaign of your own family members of yourself that's not a reason we would want you to be exercising this
hire and fire authority and there is certainly attention now it's really hard for me to believe that
the supreme court would come down on the side of the giuliani hypothetical trump can shoot james me and he has to be impeached by congress before he can be indicted
it's so i thought usefully and clarifying really extreme there's just something wrong with that we shouldn't want that to be the answer that a political consequences of impeachment has to come before any kind of criminal consequences for an obvious crime
do some go to will continue to believe believers through fundamental crisis in american politics which is that you have a congress
which has extraordinary powers to investigate and pursue and punish members of the executive branch who misbehave including the president and members of the additional brains because impeachment as available as this
method of control and investigation and monitoring and that congress has simply abdicated responsibility and then in that into that vacuum comes a president who's like yeah well i can do what i want but in any normal system you would have a congress which would say you can try it and we're going to impeach it right
or were they would threaten to and that will be restrained somebody
inflation ryan and mcconnell and change county and
presumably hopeless going to happen that speak with that they did enough in that direction to constrain champ but it's not at all clear and one of the reasons it's not at all clear is that there are lots of other members of the party not to mention fox news where this all just is seen through this lens of know
release mart packaging of with china no collusion and mean we have sean hannity on tv telling witnesses to go chopped their phones up into little pieces so that mahler can't get the content and stare of i mean there's just something kind of crazy going on about seeing the mahler investigation
in such a partisan lands that you don't want to know what the answer is did you that i see david clarke wrote a piece and another john's this speak it was sort of like the atoms are peace that's kind of overall framing that at least i liked that we talked about earlier and he was just pointing out that on the side of the investigation is this lake cacophony of reporting
he caught and i think of fuselage which is a good metaphor were predictable which peace we find out when we're are constantly trying to keep all the strings together he had this great metaphor that it's like i'm carrie mathison wall and homeland but like gone crazy and i feel that way about the details of this investigation
on the other hand you just have trump everyday saying witch hunt
that's all you need to know and i think there is a way in which that narrative is just eroding some american state and the investigation in the f b i etc and if you're a term partners and that's all fine with you your your down for that i want to turn to the other grand claim graham legal claim
the president made the hit the road to pardon himself
which i think is nonsense but that's not the real danger in what is happening with pardon the president's been flaunting pardon power this week
in a way that american should it should make americans want to weep for two reasons one the purpose of the part of the partner generally to show mercy to correct excesses to buy upon which the president did with this one
alice johnston and conquest brought are good for kim kardashian for sure but the idea of the partners a treat for celebrities or ideologues aligned with the prisoner is disgusting
and what's more disgusting as the idea that the president is dangling the possibility apartments for all of the people associated with the mall or investigation for the metaphor and the papadopoulos zoos and all these other people
it is a way of signaling to them to say stay strong as a pure mob move that's what the mobsters do it like this signal to you if you take this of you stay silent will take care of you and me i did the person is is using the pardon power and that way is much more troubling to me than the idea that he's talking about how we could part himself which isn't saying he won't do
i totally agree with the nothing that's been interesting to me and lacking in that kind of law professor commentary on on this so there are lots of law professors who are troubled and all the way as we've been talking about and it seems like trumps actions speak for themselves in terms of corrupt intent when it looks like you know you're sending the
signals you were just talking about or your stories this week like yes i told jeff sessions that i was furious with hand because he did recuse himself and i tried to talk him out of that like all these ways in which the action suggest that chant has tried to stop and block this investigation every step of the way and then you have these of
chickens stroking i'm not sure about this yet
people jack goldsmith of harvard law school for whom i have a lot of respect he's a former bush department of justice guy super smart he was making the argument this week like well maybe the fact that it's also blatant and brazen suggests that it's not corrupt and intact like that the president is just doing this because he thinks it's a big distraction and now i have to say it was driving me crazy
week because it just seems like how could you ever pass the test of in ten without you know the literal truth of like trump handing over hillary clinton's emails to the russians like i just worry when it starts getting framed as we need the president actually committing a crime
in order to decide that there's a problem here will also isn't the and ten more relevant to the destruction and the collusion
yeah and also seems like if you have several associates doing things that are illegal for a variety of reasons that that also should be something that reflects back on the president in a way that congress would care about for impeachment proceedings and that mahler my care about to trump has been very successful at raising the bar
about what would constitute grounds for impeachment or for an indictment
i want to go to turn to one other thing john witches
in the in the fuselage of this week and the the battery of new stories and new evidence and new developments was the almost passed over fact that the president's team no came to have admitted that he wrote the statement that dumb trump junior made following
the trump tower meeting with russians peddling dirt about hillary clinton and and this is something that had been denied vehemently by all parties to to to trump team all his supporters all who's spokespeople i think even his lawyers
yeah totally secular jews anyone and i turn on ancient green umbrage at the suggestion exactly
so what do we do with what are we doing it like that
you know know that that was all lies
well it's a it's a great questions when i was it was when i was to circling around was also the other one about claiming that there was a spy inside the campaign put there by the obama administration is also not true which also which which arguably is a more corrosive untruth because it affects the department of justice
it affects the behind this is the official word coming from the president's lawyer and the official word by the way the president's loner and his spokesperson who spoke with the authority and either implicit and explicit authority of having talk to the president i don't know i don't know what you do but it is worth sometimes stopping and taking a look
the dangers that everybody become so used to this that that's no longer shocking it should be really shocking and i founded clarifying and and conversation i had with some with newt gingrich this week to go back begin with you by the way says the idea of self partying use some is not a good idea and doesn't think he suggests
he didn't think it was possible even but when you go man can look at what he said in nineteen ninety eight to all of the various claims that the clinton team was trying to make to block secret service people from testifying of the things they were trying to do basically gingrich said there to principles i'm prepared to live and die on the first is that the american people have the right to know
no about basic facts and the second is that we're a nation of the rule of law and new person including the president is above the law
and that seems to me to be the basic question hear about this investigation is that the president you can you can come up with all kinds of hand waving and exciting readings of the constitution but the bottom the bottom line is use the president the law and do we know the facts and when the when the white house and the people employed
the president are actively saying things to push people away from the fans and to diminish the it's already have federal officials that's a that's a big problem what would you think
ask you to speak for the current true you host or
but i guess there's a question about whether the tv shows and radio shows that have trump administration official on administration officials who have a history of peddling lies whether they should stop having them on and i don't i'm not sure there's a good answer to that either but
it is to me troubling that that so easy for top level trump administration official to get on and to spew enough lies and cause to so enough confusion
that that people interviewing them can they can do remember every single furniture mean i have sounded very useful to have tray gatti on and newt gingrich in order to use people who are not considered fans of the left to
shape what is an agreed set of facts or at least bring them back closer to reality then from what we're we're hearing from the president of the united states on some of these issues
asking the vice president about anybody who had contacts with the russians getting him on the record and having video of the vice president saying there were no interactions with anybody in the administration and the russians is a useful piece of video tape to have in these debates i don't think not having them on at all
good idea i think you have to refresh and put on the record things that people say not taking what they say at face value after a pattern of this
one just has to keep that in the forefront of people's minds i'm not sure that completely banning people from television it's the right where you know why i've been thinking about is the way in which we we give the president and his people we give the government the benefit of the gap time at you and yet increasingly that thing is not too
true and that benefit of the doubt mean spreading lies inadvertently and i don't think the press has a way to respond to that i mean the that you were just saying like it has to be true rain and but it relies on a marketplace of ideas theory of that information that you put true information out there and then that competes with the false information
when end but i don't think we live in that universe necessarily right now at least not for a significant segment of the american public and i don't know how the press is supposed to adjust to that like how the press comes into the way it has breathing room with the assumption that it is being lied to and then proceed
seeds from now assumption like how would that possibly why will i mean i don't who
anytime you walk into the white house briefing room maybe lied is too strong word but i mean it's obviously you you're always going to get spin but
obviously this is something much different that we're living in the world we're living in now
i think i've noticed a contractual as ocean of official comments certainly old since the beginning of this administration
we don't just allow statements to go out without putting them in the proper context or noting that there's either contradiction by official sources or no evidence for the claim but i think also part of it is you know
press has an eighteen percent approval rating impart and non non did that was that was the case before donald trump was president and in part it's because of a lot of behavior that the engaged in and over the years
hi being stories that don't deserve the hype and making broad claims that don't will stand the scrutiny so there are contributory parts of those that
our fault for as well
one my thing that us thing i
this is unrelated i carry this scott pruitt just amazing array of stories of like were little daddy corruption just like junk and yet the manifesto an office i mean like three scarecrow it cycles ago i think david you asked to predict like what do you remain and i thought
okay health l survive that particular cycle but the next one you have begun no no no it seems like it does not matter what story is published about got through it he just remains there and that we're not even talking about it it's not even one of referee topics are rude or we should note that at least one interesting development on the proof
friends is the joni ernst the iowa republican senator and this had a little bit to do with of ethanol subsidies and i will but never never mind that joni ernst said that prove it was as swampy as it gets talking talking about in she said
yet he remains at me head
but but isn't that right so let's we should come up with the fast sorting technique which is one yeah that is amazing especially for a president who who's arguably signature campaign issue was draining the swamp so there's there's the acknowledgment and then there is the what we recognise last time we talked about
those which is that because he pursues a certain set of policies that the president prefers and the many of the president submerge prefers that's why he's not in many political danger so that's that's the answer i just don't get it they like approved the deputy guy like weeks ago was go that i can to step in and he'll just keep doing soldiering on
all the policy work that we like settlement anywhere
it is astonishing

mastery of cake shop emily go
mean back to the case made her that him
this is one of their highly rated cases of the tan jack that a baker in colorado did not wanna take a wedding cake for a gay couple who came in and ask for cake for their wedding
the couple complained to the colorado civil rights commission because colorado has a civil rights law preventing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation the couple one at that stage feel that all jack philip sued and jack thirds has now emerged victorious in front of the supreme court
and yet it a decision that both sides saw something to celebrate and it was seventy two there was a lot of compromising going on the ruling itself is very fact specific to colorado in a way that disappointment a lot of conservatives so
generally injustice candy for the majority said it's absolutely clear that colorado can protect and gay people from discrimination there are a nice language and if you're and gay rights percent about how odious that far of prejudice is however a desk and he said this colorado civil rights commission to nachos
efficient respect for jack philips as religious beliefs there are few quotes from the commissioners candy pulled out he just thought they were suspicious of religion and didn't mean phelps would necessarily when below but it meant that this particular proceeding was unfair to han that's the way in which he won but sick
jazz that if you were a civil rights commission in colorado or another state with a case like this in front of you if you just said nice things about religion along the way to making a finding of discrimination that would be good enough candy certainly left the door open to that and then jeff kagan wrote a concurrence in which he
like really invaded that kind of outcome
in some ways i feel like the politics of this ruling are pretty good for the country it's not going to be a big rallying cry on either side for the mid term elections it doesn't look like a liberal supreme court is abusing religious people forcing them to do anything but on the other hand it looks fake wow
certainly wasn't a clean victory for gay couples who want service for their weddings it didn't shut the door to that either i didn't find it all that intellectually satisfying because to me in the comments that the commissioners made about religion they can't he took such umbrage about seemed like they were just saying it was bad to use your religious beliefs to hurt other people
that does seem like a bad news that religion but if you're able to look beyond that i think the majority decision has something in it for everyone and months and i have lots might have se me ha garza just concurrent but i'm going to stop talking and let you guys get a word it would like to hear what you have to say but that but i'd like to ask this question more broadly which is most every decision from
the supreme court be momentous or can they just issue
decisions and actually it turns out it's very near and small and when we should move on i'm not saying that's the case in this case i'm just in general it is the case in this case and yes there is a whole argument that this is like a good thing for the court to take a smaller role especially with an issue that is recent and just playing out i mean to me
one of the most significant senses and the kennedy opinion if he just says factually early on in two thousand and twelve when this dispute with happening between the speaker and this couple colorado had not had not yet legalized gay marriage
marriage like it's early days everybody we're all getting used to the idea the state was not even protecting this rate at that point and i think there's a language this decision just let this bubble up at the state level they're going to be lots of other cases and it's also just really important to remember that these cases only arise in states that
i have statutes that protect people from discrimination there is no federal law like that so this is only happening in places that have shown this particular kind of concern for gay rights that makes me hopeful that these these conditions are going to be able to come to conclusions that people can live with and then you know from the beginning they think one of the responses
this case has been look they're not that many merchants were refusing to sort of gay people let the markets sort of take care of this there's a counter argument which is like we didn't say that in the nineteen sixties when black people were being denied service that worse we did not let people use their religious beliefs as an excuse to continue that form of racism
and it's important for businesses as places of public accommodation to be serving everyone calls are different because i mean i think room
the
the institutional support for kind of racism was deeper for me institutional support for not supreme gay couples in particular where's the establishment of jim crow
the legal and crown nation or been was much more profound than what this now not to sit there are clearly wrong has been done to people so does this mean the two questions first of all so in states that don't have these civil rights protections for for gay people
that means you have a right to get married because married because that's a federal road but you don't have any wrote to get anyone to make you a wedding cake
or anyone to do anything provide a service for your marriage
for your way
in those other states in mississippi say yes
like you would lose this case in mississippi and there are other states
i don't know if this is true of mississippi but remember the hall like religious freedom restoration act is states were passing what are called many references these laws that has showed special solicitude for religious people who had objection so you can have the kind of reverse of colorado's laws were a baker would be
specially insulated and from having this cake and the couple that have no right to set to the other big question is the to the supreme court avoided the first amendment question to they did not get to the question of whether the baker had a right to express himself from the way that he chose and therefore to not be forced to make a cake
that would violate his his artistic desires are we going to get a case which is going to address his first amendment issue
yes i think we will i think it will take awhile at kind of percolate below justice thomas's descent is all about as he thinks this is like a straight up violation of freedom of expression of the baker and oral argument this turned into one of those like an angels dancing on the head of the pen problems for the supreme court how do you draw the line
nine the a lawyer for the baker memorably argued to the he was cake artist with protected rights of expression but a makeup artist was not a real artist and could be told by the state to provide her or his services to this couple at it just think the lines between conduct an expression don't really exist
i'm more talking about this kind of service and i don't know what the supreme court is ever going out what to do about that a baby it just is unresolved bomb because someone who relies on components regularly and i can totally screwed are distributed month to do
can i can i talk about the the concurrence work for a second you so i mean bungled essen it's like confusing but there was another case in colorado surely lake deliberately provoked in which another man his last name happens to be jack's ordered
a cake from three different bakers that was in the shape of a viable and it said things on it like homosexuality is a sin so it's like the anti gay marriage cake and those bakers refuse to bake the cake and those bakers unlike jack thoughts one in front of the colorado
civil rights commission so this comes up isn't a majority opinion as like another reason to be suspicious of this commission
justice kagan says about this different scenario and this is different than jack philips because these bakers didn't want to make this cake for anybody this was just they were objecting to the cake the the anti gay rights message of the cake not to the people
who are paying it and then justice course it says no no no this is totally equivalent because what what matters is the cake had a message to jack philips the anti gay marriage baker that was supporting gay weddings and so he wouldn't have baked is pro gay
wedding cake for anybody either and then gossage goes down this whole to me it was very tangential but it's like very ardently argued passage about levels of generality and how the colorado commissions mistakes were just and curable so unlike justice candy
i think he's basically saying if you profess religious beliefs and you don't want to do something for religious reasons you win because we're not going to be able to really interrogate whether you're religious belief is sincere and not like he takes at face value that this guy who ordered the bible cake did that for religious reasons and therefore was being discriminated against
based on the basis of his religion and then he says well you know this commission because it imputed prejudice to jack philips but not to these other bakers is has like committed this fundamental incurable flaw and like you lose forever anyway it was i thought a decision
that had real implications suggesting that course it sees this case not only in terms of not being sympathetic to gay rights but being very sympathetic to the rights of religious people there's this interesting piece of our camera who wrote it by a lawyer who has spent his career dealing with abortion and followed for row
oh and he's an abortion rate supporter
and the point he made in this piece is it's incredibly it's been incredibly deadly to abortion rights to have all these little religious exemptions in the law because they have just increased and they've gotten broader and broader and broader so it's no longer just that if you are
a doctor you can't you for religious beliefs you can decline and to perform an abortion which i think of an exemption we can all understand but it's gotten to the point where where fewer
a hospital with some religious affiliation vague religious affiliation you can decline have anything to do with any abortion and can can decline to talk to people about it
now it encompasses contraception this is creeping quality of religious exemption where that is so privileged that idea that you have religious belief it trumps every single other thing ever even the the of
taking care of someone who isn't in need and who who who seeks you're a professional advice and expertise and it's very disturbing but it has become so prevalent so i don't think we should insofar as the masterpiece decision is one the privileges
carves out yet another religious exemption or makes it clear that the your religious the your religious beliefs trump everything else i don't think we should be to gleeful know

the president is missing
many liberals wish were news report they also know may wish to do with applied to president bill clinton with all to present to begin
bill clinton's back he is now novelist he has written a novel total the present as methane with james patterson it sounds like an absolute terrible thrower
it was about a president named jonathan a link and duncan and compare the name jonathan duncan to william jefferson clinton
familiar but the president goes and some thriller adventure and their celebrity celebratory i haven't read the book i'm not going to read the book james patterson with terrible right there is a very funny review i think it minute who who's review is now completely blinking just just tears apart how poorly written the book of anyway the present is missing is made news because
be fascinating the disastrous book tour that clinton paterson are currently engaged in which involves interviews that quickly veer from the book to clinton's place in the context for me to moment
and the picture went off the rails almost immediately when recording born on the today show
last week and he really botched some questions about the lewinsky scandal and monica lewinsky it has now become a part of every interview
john was this been so bad for clint we think have been so fluent whole is so good ready to answer any question why has he been so terrible well as you get this specific case here and him and i think the most interesting piece of this to me was even called there when he had clinton on after he her
as to show appearance and kobe actually for those who want to
look at the art of question asking it was it was really well done so he first he said do you want a second shot at that so that was an open invitation to get it exactly right and what the president then said was this wasn't my finest hour he suggested nbc had condense the his response
and he said i apologize to the monica lewinsky men and i apologize to her now
he said i paid my i've paid for it over the last twenty years
just stopping there for a moment i think what this demonstrates is both a specific problem with respect to the mean to move in and also one that people attached to the past behavior of president clinton in the specific with respect to the need to moment there seems to be an inability by anybody caught up in any of its various forms to issue what sounds like an actual
apology
and so everybody knows what an apology sounds like and every time you hold something back and give a stiff apology people know it
and that's not going to pass in this moment and you know an apology is i was wrong so that's one thing i was wrong period that's where you start to suggest that any i deeply and here here apart yeah
i'm really sorry i am sorry and also by the way you don't talk about it being edited out or condensed and you don't talk about i'm going to suffer because it turns out that this is about other people suffering and you know i was wrong and i'm sorry and i caused a lot of pain that people are still feeling which i understand and i'm trying to learn from this as much as i have been over twenty years
because i recognize that this wrong is one that last more than just the moment it was in and an apology like that which people would recognize as an apology would put you in a place where people would see that you had grown and instead what people concluded was that he was basically not really sorry and
men what i think call bear his follow up was was
pretty amazing when he basically said you know you don't you don't seem and is said to bill clinton who was sitting inches away from him he said you don't seem to understand that you were asked about this but and then he called air said you are the most famous example of a powerful man sexually misbehaving and work in my lifetime
which as a questioner you want to you want to set the stakes accurately for your audience so that they can understand the context in which the interview was taken place
in clinton's answer was not didn't meet the stakes that called their had said form clinton's answer was look i'm paying
been attacked more in my career than anybody else i've given you a pound of flesh and you want to yeah
bear with very well fed
yeah i was very also
family here's the question why
george w bush with a disaster brother he brought us into wars that were catastrophic for the country
he presided over an economic collapse that kaufman the people their jobs
myth handle the katrina but derby bush you shows up anywhere people treat him with the respect
that would be treated with is honored and and respected basically by all why this bill clinton rule book written who was a more successful president but don't have this it's mark against it why does clinton inspire much more irritation them but i mean i don't think that fair
i think bush gets plenty of criticism on laughed and people are abandoned our heads five but i also think bill clinton wants to be let off the hook for his
his misdeeds because he wasn't more successful president and that is just not washing for people in this moment anymore
so two things struck me and honestly like the first just amazed me it seemed like he was totally taken aback of course he was going to get this question the notion that he didn't have a well rehearsed sincere sounding apology available to him in the moment with nbc was incredible to me
and suggest that he's living in a complete la land like this is going to happen to every man with any kind of me to baggage and bill clinton had like they have the suitcase of the mall and the second is that done that wonderful apology a descriptive for him i cannot imagine hearing it from and so i was shocked or he was unprepared and
then totally unable to imagine him coming through and that moment and it is because that clinton is both of their but you know let's focus on bill clinton because hillary clinton's issues but they're flake are left there and my view
he met his conduct like his defensive brittle well i'm the one who's been persecuted way of thinking about any criticism that hand has been one of his defining traits and that is really irritating especially when everyone else is being forced to confront the l ways in which they treated women
and to make it all their him as opposed to the fact that he has never privately apologize to monaco and ski was pathetic and so you know he has been someone i've wrestled with it like as a leader and struggled with and about done left for a long time and this is just a reminder of the worst i mean study i think liberals and
particularly liberal women feel really guilty guess they feel really don't need it they blew it the first time at the he did such wrong and they now know where the context of twenty years later the conduct of me too oh my god that was really any more modern favorite i don't know and then a fancy embark right the defence the defence they would
never amount today and that they're ashamed of and so what are they do they take it out on quinn which is that actually i don't know your formulation suggests there's something unfair going on i thought rebecca traced me and an interesting point related to that's when she said that feminists have been apologizing and accounting for themselves and going through itself scrutiny and remorse for their treatment of monaco
oh and scan excuse that bill clinton for the last twenty years at least like the last two or three years and so the notion that bill clinton himself with think that he was above having to have such an accounting was particularly and ferrying emily and if you'd like you wished the garbage with vera
yes i i wish to you would vanish and then i remember him twenty twelve dern obama reelection campaign clinton came back and gave a speech at the democratic convention new to thought man that guy has a way of framing issues and presenting political issues that it's so persuasive when he turns it on it was in credit
cool and and so every time i think i never want to hear from the sky them then recall actually he he's better than any democrat at framing the issues that they care about or was he used to be maybe you have a name or i don't know if that's a good or my i don't like presence to disappear in any way because even to the extent that they show themselves to be less
her them the heavy hugger fee or more them horrible reviews they may have when they leave the office
it gives us a more complete picture of the president and presidency and since we have this warped version of the presidency a more complete and complex picture of it is better as far as i'm concerned that of grown up answer john john this topic
john more just gravitate president and and
i think i think it's my my high horses i'm you know you guys have no simply put a foot the step stool right in front of me you've given me some guardrails to get alive

it's like a beer bloody mary
i'd like a mitchell otto was some tournaments a lotta and for tata
well what will you be countered actually before we do that
listen great listener shatters and i want to talk about one with no chatter from
we're we're inviting you and will continue to invite you to submit your shatters to us about things that you think we should chatter better things that you're going to be chattering about and by me mean three treat them at flip get them back and minnesota that we have a great tweet from wake underscore eighty one about the college board or had a conversation
my daughter about with independently
word which runs the advanced placement programs is slashing the a p world history curriculum and half so it is now removing all content from before fourteen fifty so if you're going to take world history and you're gonna learn advanced placement world history it's only going to cover essentially the renaissance on so there's no
an african islamic or muslim american history before the arrival of europeans that's unsettling i think they did it because it was tons was the curriculum is too vast it was too much to cram into an entire year but maybe they want it to tests instead yeah they didn't they did not do that
her fingers and thank you to wake underscore eighty one so send us your chatter treat us at flake out fest
emily what is your chatter
we i think correctly decided not to talk about that equals being disinvited i guess to the white house this week like the latest on dating and black athletes die president but i just loved that malcolm jenkins response he he's this incredibly committed
criminal justice or former on the eagles and instead of taking the presses questions about the whole white house like made up drama or created drama jenkins had these big pieces of wait for it that's not the right post white poster board with facts about inequities
unfairness is in the criminal justice system and as reporters were barking questions at ham he was showing then on camera the facts and these questions about mass incarceration and then every time someone continue to bleed out some question that he was not interested then he would hold up away poster board that said you're not listening it's a really great like minute and
half a video and made my celebrity crush on malcolm jenkins which was already strong even stronger
we can get an employee
the chance to meet malcolm jenkins know i got to meet him a couple months ago that so it's like actually in in person and crash wow
john what does your trailer
your celebrity crush muslim country
crucially tim howard taft
no although my celebrity crush recently is jennifer lawrence and her appearance on the late show called there
which i didn't see in the moment but it's a wide ranging interview
good chase a china is about anthony ray into who is many things to he was he served thirty years in prison for a crime he didn't commit he was on death row and his book that he's actually been selected by o'brien's her book club pick he was on the show this week and for somebody
who has served thirty years on death row wrongfully to be in his presence he he's just a shining
person no bitterness and full of forgiveness and his book is fantastic and it's not only a great story which will infuriate you it will make you enraged it will then bill due back up
sounds great but these great one liners he is kind of a born storyteller he wrote it eco wrote it with a woman named laura love harden but you when you talk to him you see what storyteller he is his imagination is so acute because for thirty years in prison he basically used his imagination to ca
instruct worlds where he could basically get through the fact that he was off in solitary confinement and that he was in prison for crime he didn't commit anyway his story about his mother about his friend lester who i won't spoil it for you it's a great book great read and he's a wonderful person it's called the sun don't shine and so i recommend it to
recommended to people and i recommend you actually watch her conversation with them because we had a home back half of the show planned and we just they just the producers and everything just blew it up and just let him keep talking and our conversation keep going so empty ran to the terms of awesome yes
by chatter speaking of x president's is about a really sweet little video i saw the week on dead spin dave mckenna an old friend of mine
i think is a good writer and used to be my colleague you to wash them city paper he's just as wonderful sweets fascinating sportswriter lovely regard he does videos for goods been in several years ago back in two thousand twelve its mother died after terrible illness
he was heartbroken
he was working one day and a coffee shop in washington we just gotten back to was just gone back to work after his mother's funeral and was just kind of recovery unit and sitting there and sitting there with five other people in coffee shop
secret service guy comes in and sort of sweeps the room and says i have to check everyone's bag because the president's coming though it coffee shops like what's going on
human fighter the president shows up and walks over to dave who has been pointed out to him and spends a minute consoling him and same i've asked my mother and i know what it's like him
your tell you it will get better and was this moment of consolation for dave and had all been needed because jay carney who is i guess builds them obama has press secretary or communications director something was a very close friend of mckenna must have been talking about him to the president the president decided
because it was coming by was it was going to be in the neighborhood where date lives he was just going to drop by and say a few compelling words and it's it's a wonderful little story and dave tells it beautifully and with great emotion so i was looking at this video on dead spin by dave mckenna
that's our here for the day the deficit is produced by jocelyn franco researcher busy road you can follow us on twitter that's like death and pleased tweet
