president announced tuesday that the united states will withdraw from the joint comprehensive plan of action and the agreement forged by the us and other major powers including the u russia and china
to restrain and monitor iran's nuclear program for ten fifteen twenty years the exact duration stretches depending on which part of it you're talking about while ending or easing international sanctions on iran and returning billions in frozen assets that that we've kept of iran and other countries that kept him around
jumps announcement was met with i would say massive sigh of disappointment and much of the world france had practically begged him to stay in iran supreme leader
khamenei to clear that the us cannot be trusted we are joined to talk about this
diplomatic flurry by max fisher who are three interpret call him for the new york times he has been writing about the collapse of the iraq deal and implication three us foreign policy hello max welcome to the fist to guys so what is likely to happen now that the us has pulled out of this deal
i mean there's no american strategy that has been articulated are planned so if we assume that kind of we just project out the last twenty four hours out into the future
the two basic outcomes in the short term that kind of unclear and then there's like a long term very certain set of outcomes in the short term
one possibility that the iranians in the europeans and all the other party since the scream and are trying to hold in place is basically keep the deal with out the united states
and that at least in theory is not impossible
united states is going to be impose sanctions on iran that american sanctions were actually never the really tough ones that was the one from european countries from the un security council and from asian countries that we basically asked as a favor to limit trade with around all of that came away with the way it's going to stay away
the iranians are saying that they're going to continue to stick with the agreement but the big issue that that sets up is that in in the term administration saw this coming and he knew that the europeans knee running for basically just going to ignore their exit so with their threatening to do now is to impose what are called secondary sanctions against any and
it does business with the iranian banks and institutions retargeting which sounds like a drag technical matter with that actually means in plain english is that we're going to start sanctioning the europeans which is actually is crazy and extreme as it sounds who are already threatening to cut off
a airbus steal that is worth about twenty two billion that is obviously got airbus executives and european leaders pretty upset the american ambassador to germany yesterday basically threatened any german company that continues to do business in around saying that they were going to face american secondary sanctioned nothing links that has ever
ever happened before so it's really hard to tell where that's going to go but even if the european an iranian plane works it can introduce this enormous economic conflict between the europeans and americans and hurt you know at least the american and european economies by creating this distance between them and the other
version the one that the trump administration's really hoping for is that they will succeed in killing the deal out right and basically forcing european companies not to do business in around just by creating enough uncertainty for say it's not worth it were not can invest in the iranian economy
business doesn't materialize the iranian say we're not getting our end of this agreement so screw it we're going to continue on the nuclear development and enrichment that we were doing before the deal was signed they've finally to deal which they would be within their rights of doing because the americans walked away first and we end up back where we were
in two thousand and fifteen with the iranians racing pretty quickly towards a nuclear capability
now they would be much closer because they have to know how and also their missile programs would be a lot more advanced so it's hard to see how that's a win but it's definitely we're headed to one of those two max one of the things that i find so distressing about all this is you know it's far as anyone can tell and it seems
like actually we can tell quite a lot the iranians were doing exactly what they said they would do and they were failing their end of the bargain in terms of the way in which they were stopping their nuclear program and it seems like it's the iranians economically who probably stand to lose the most here and let the moderate leader of iran on you know as the new york time
sad when the deal on our part the helix
like a fool and that that's going to weaken the forces in iran that are for moderation that want to open up to the last the trend administration is saying no no it's all good regime change on we're going to topple the hardliners what do you think about those claims
i mean we tried this exact play book once before in two thousand and two with north korea and it was actually with some of the same
administration officials then that are kind of pushing the around policy and how john bolton was a really big architect of this we walked away from a nuclear deal that we had with north korea and north korea was was cheating a little bit around the margins in a way that the iranians are not hear the iranians are everybody says complying with every aspect of this
steel but he kind of american argument that the bush administration was making is that this government is north korea is not one that we can ever trust it's one that's implacable hostels the united states so what we have to do is to walk away from and deal that were limit their program and instead you know impose maximum press
sure to destroy the government but that didn't work
it's actually hard to point to really any example in history where economic sanctions especially ones impose just by the united states lead a government to collapse instead it tends to do is make that government feel and battled empower the people in government that say we have to prepare for the possibility of a war rather than
emphasizing diplomacy and also create a real sense of threat which is exactly what north korea did they went ahead hadn't developed a much more sophisticated nuclear missile program when they had before the deal and they're now using that to great effect to compel us to the negotiating table and you sure seems like where we would end up pushing the
so you you wrote about i think to really significant long term issues that arise from the joint action on iran and north korea this week one is that there's a message for the world that the united states can only be trusted to abide by agreements that the current president has met
there is made and then and that therefore especially in the absence of an ability to actually pass treaties the senate seem to have lost its ability to pass treaties that the idea of getting in two thirds approval of a treaty these days seems farfetched not impossible that given that that international agreements have no long term weight with the united states
and present trump is just validated that by withdrawing from one or and also withdrawn from paris to the climate accords and then secondly this notion that iran with plane by the rules restraining it's program and now it's getting screwed whereas north korea
which was ignoring kind of the rules building a nuclear weapons is getting in a summit and negotiations what are the kind of to what of the long term implications those two too fat
right
thing that the united states now saying our policy is than any international green is only in forced through the next presidential election
it's really easy to understate how seriously that is taken abroad
i mean brian hook who's a senior state department official he came and explicitly said this he said the a play was an agreement signed by an administration that is no longer here so we don't take it seriously
other countries hear that especially because the way that these agreements work is that you know
people always talk about oh how could you sign an agreement with iran how could you trust them what we don't the agreement assumes that they're going to lie and imposes all these inspection built around that assumption but what the agreements do assume is that the united states is going to stick to its where he's agreements and never have provisions built and then say well what if the americans cheat or to domestic politics become real
volatile and it turns out that they don't follow international agreements anymore because that is not an assumption that people have had to operate on but i mean we've given them so many data points now suggesting that that is in fact the case and not just during the trump administration that i really do think starting with this north korea agreement
starting you're going to see that built into how countries do with us that they're going to assume first of all in agreement unique is only good for a few years so i'm only going to offer concessions that are good for years and second of all that i have to assume you're going to cheat
violate break it off and then become an overwhelming military threat to my country it's easy for us to forget how threatening we look to the rest of the world because of how much more powerful we are i think we're going to see that with north korea and sure we'll see them offered a gift things that may maybe some other
missile facilities but not in a way that permanently dismantles things the way that are granted i mean that you can only break that once which have just done and ask a country to do that again
max in that context about north korea something that just struck me and i wondered if you had a reaction on on thursday morning with the return of three americans the president said very warm things about kim jong on vice president like penn state around the morning broadcast shows said very nice things about the north korean leader
her and then you course you had the secretary of state meeting with kim jong on and the picture looked like you know what we might expect from a cheery meeting with an old fashioned us ally lots of smiles lots of deference we're a long way from rocket man and fire and ferry what do you make of all that i mean i think on some level that
that's effective diplomacy
the case that the north koreans have always had in mind his mouth and nixon and that's that's what they want to reproduce so i think it's not a mistake that you're seeing symbolism out of these that look very similar and it's not a mistake that they're asking for one on one meetings which is what mao caught with nixon right now didn't want to meet him
nixon and khrushchev one on one to show that china was you know appear of the united states that's what north korea is pushing for if that brings huge dividends and concessions then i don't know that seems like smart effective diplomacy to me but the downside is that if we give him all of this symbolic imagery
at the front end without getting big concessions are promises and returned which of these prisoners so far we have not then we've given away what is one of our biggest one time negotiating chips without making sure we got something back one thing i wonder looking ahead then north korea negotiations it just seems like trump is going to be
credibly eager to declare victory no matter what this is going to be the meal that he did good deal the only good deal and i just wonder how that dynamic plays into these negotiations as we anticipate i'm starting max
right now i think that's a great point and that's why you hear you talk to former diplomat about the way that these talks are being structured they are just pulling their hair out because the way that this is supposed to work as the months or years of pre negotiations with a low level officials who don't have anything to lose politically if they don't
back with something if they have to play good cop bad cop if they have to walk back some demand that they make
they can hammer out the agreement and then you bring in the leaders at the very and that's always the way that this has work to bring in the leaders at the front end first of all introduces huge amount of volatility to its second of all trump is because he's the president and this is so public really constrained as a negotiator in a way that you know whatever low level state department
whoever is not and the he said he's built up such enormous expectations for this they are going to be real political costs for him if he doesn't come back with a good deal and that's going to be obvious to the north koreans so we're already setting the table in a way that privileges them max one very quick final
question about this do you think that trump and trumps advisors
in their heart of hearts believe it was the right thing to do that sort of believe it or anything to do but they really a want to fill a campaign promise and be are engage in this process of of tearing down off the previous presidents accomplishment
aliens are very telling you what i think and then just because i'm here in europe how it scene and maybe that will be interesting for you the i mean what i think in terms of why it's happening it sure seems like and trumps part it's personal
animus towards obama but also that they have been really significant staffing changes in the white house where he used to have kind of you know studies center of the road more pragmatic foreign policy hands running things who did not want to do this and now you have more ideological types like john bolton who have always wanted to
you break up the cream and psych this and we're a bit more extreme and militaristic in their approach these kinds of things so i think it's both of those and you probably need both of those together
although again the fact that there is no articulated strategy a long term plan here
does give one the impression that it's less about foreign policy per se than about kind of domestic politics or like weird into personal issues in terms of how it seems here actually hear people very little talk about the particulars of trump or his administration and what might be driving it
almost always hear discussed as part of people here and an asian allies as well see as a long term american pattern dating back twenty years i mean people are bringing up treaties that i think most americans including people in foreign policy don't even think about the ab and treaty that we backed out of and two thousand and one
he agreed framework and two thousand and two with north korea and people are starting to get the sense that this is not a like one time trump be aberration but rather this is a kind of true face of america and this is kind of who we are which i don't know it and it's happening enough that i think it's worth considering the fisher price interpreter calm the new york times max thanks for

so michael cohen president's personal lawyer received half million dollars you may shady russian oligarchs shortly after paying off stormy daniels then he also received millions of other dollars from a pharmaceutical company know artists from a t and t from a korean arms manual
sure i think presumably as part of some sort of pay for play scheme and twenty seven thousand and to get access to the president we have been reminded this week that the potential corruption involving trumps inner circle potentially enormous that we don't know a lot about it it's not visible to us often and suddenly became
visible and it seems outrageous but it's also really complicated and hard to follow emily
what it was shocking if anything
about the revelation coming from michael everybody who stormy daniels stephanie clifford's lawyer
what was so shocking about has revelation that that cohen's imaginary company essential consulting with receiving millions of dollars from weird sources including russian oligarchs and companies with business in front of the trap administration eight i'm going to define shocking as like should be surprising even if it's not and
in that vein i think what is riveting here is the notion that the very same shell company cohen set up to pay off start me daniels was also raking in money from at least one company controlled by or invested heavily and by this rash and arc this you know
new character and our drama his name is an addict or vic sober that
i'm having trouble they're just so many proper nouns and names to keep track of strain to i knew it's totally vessel burning
effects of arguing yeah anyway that part is
amazing and interesting and it just makes me want to know where else this is going to go i feel like groping blindly right now where there are these variants eric schneiderman her
i feel confused are at least like i can't see all the different pieces of this and how they fit together do you guys have that feeling too yes if for no other reason than one detailed that struck me was that these special counsel knew about these payments
two companies back in november and so therefore presumably the banks over months and this this hasn't leaked till now second point is he knew that all that special cancelled it and still did the new knock sweep of the house hotel and office which means whatever they were going for their
was even more interesting more potentially explosive because the way it was done and because he already knew this stuff of that the special payments that were made so it suggests wow there must really be some other big big thing out there and that's just one new reveal it of this otherwise fast story that has
you know flows into all kinds of different areas the what we should point out though that it wasn't mahler's team did the no not that it's a whole separate set of prosecutors so low because he gave them the information to create to no knock wrote
emily just to go back to it but i think you were when you were using shock in kind air quotes there it is as goes may remember i'm sort of less exercised about corruption
then that i think you guys are probably most of our listeners are that you know whatever trumps getting rich as a businessman use shady and
that's never felt to me like the worst thing in the world but there's just so much of it there's so much of this this unbelievable
self dealing and backdoor dealing there was right
wrath out there was this it will end in exactly that they needed drain the swamp suppose
if let mean just just just to the one one that we didn't even talk about and last couple weeks episode with cutter which has been under a huge amount of diplomatic pressure and
it's gotten on the wrong type the saudis and gotten on the wrong side of jared kushner and cutter just bought an apartment very ostentatiously in public which is bob
five million dollar apartment building an apartment in one of trumps buildings they just basically gave five million dollars directly to a trump property and made it very publicly known that they were doing that
that's kind kind of pain of influence is so disturbing in a way that i didn't know that i get disturbed but i even hi i'm bitter by it
influence peddling is usually more subtle than this but according to the boarding michael caine was basically going around saying hey i can get you access and influence and these companies were desperate to find some inroads to a mercurial an unknown and disruptive president what is so central
it seems to me about this point is the one you're making which is he was all of those things not of washington not familiar disruptive impulsive and those are the qualities that we're supposed to be aligned with what he actually said which is that he was going to drain the swamp
and so they ours and so they are engaging in high level graduate level swamp behavior in buying off his clothes
attorney for the purposes of of trying to get access to him in so the question is did michael cohen not believe the stuff that the president said when his campaign because of you believe that the candidate really believe these things then you wouldn't dare engage in this kind of behavior right because you would be offending the person with whom you are so close or he thought that the president wasn't really
serious when he said all of that and then finally i'd like to raise this question should a t and t in awareness and the other anybody else feel shame for having engaged in these behaviors or are they doing exactly what they are supposed to do which is maximizing shareholder value by playing the system by the well known rules that it exists because obviously
there's an entire system of lobbying where this is where this would be considered of of a fashion sort of best practices as opposed to something shady yeah that's a good question i think actually again because maybe i'm a cynical person i think what eighteen of artist it is totally okay
by the standards of of the day that it's that it's their responsibility to try to whatever way they can whatever legal way they can influence the president and influence administration and if if they saw this as a way to get access what's wrong is that we should have people in public service
who reject it who refuse those blandishments and we don't have people in public service who actively are seeking and president trump has made it known that he wants essentially to be her doesn't care if people in a circle or being bribed been he himself wants to get the benefits of of public service in his pocket
also what about an incline was not in public service right part of what was going on here was that he had been passed over he didn't get a job and the administration and he was going to cash in on his relationship with the president in a different way so now we have this conversation okay which laws did he break seems like he broke some law
here and what what lot anyway well there's money laundering there's campaign finance violations on and i also feel like there's no reason to think that the payments coming into this particular shell corporation are the only ones to michael cohen and the administration since the trend administration started that seems unlikely doesn't it yes
seems very unlikely themes exceptionally on lately
and really do you think that anything materially has changed for the legal cases this week you that you can tell superficially birth of course sure that muller and investigators are looking at different facts and things them we're looking at but just from a problem with that interested me i mean i do think michael caine is in more trouble than a minute before not that he was
in any trouble but it just seems like they're just the plot sickening around hand that's a figure and given how tidy is to trump on that seem significant also of course there are other kind of still unresolved accusations that he was having meetings with people and the russian government or intelligence service
you know in that summer of what was that twenty six team that still sort of floating out there that the steel dossier allegations and that could of course connect cullen into the russia investigation which leads me to my next question if they're connected wide and muller refer out the colin investigation to the southern
strict of new york to this other set of prosecutors and then i thought that was a smart move and mellor made it because it means there's a us attorney's office involved and nason it takes some of that political heat away from milan and spreads it out and it could be that you know that they can dissect best way to make prosecutor can talk to each other the southern district can do that
corruption money hunkering campaign finance part and they can to hand the rest back to mahler but it is interesting that these stories seem like they could connect and yet they're are divided in terms of which prosecutors are in charge did you see this crazy amazing piece which i think was a new york magazine
the most exciting peace i read this week i'm not a person of believe in conspiracy known the jonathan chait crazy conspiracy theory
crazy applies only to one point six million dollar pay off that was made to a apparently to read playboy playmate who had an abortion after having an affair with a random republican fundraiser and embryology authority a person no one had ever heard of before hand and know i'm over here from again that brody apparently using cohen funneled one point six million dollars is this
playmate who had an affair with him to buy her silence
this may be wasn't a payment from brodie but a payment from trunk
the notable facts years at the names in the the names and the deal with the playmate are the same names that would have used in the story daniel deal the same l l c that used to pay it off no one had ever heard of birdie trump obvious has a history of playmates already has no history at all this kind of behavior
not clear why party would want to pay that much money to clear his name and finally that brady had a lot of government business a lot of opportunity to get government contracts that he was waiting for and which he got after all this payments went through suggesting that maybe he took a fall in exchange for getting some better deal later you say
i did that how he had actually bribes am a government official and now related way involving his girlfriend and hush money before also that yeah so there's a lot of lot of a weird side evidence who knows does he bring in the john edwards i'm yeah
added to do to get this and this story was written by paul campus
it's a crazy story and also there's the fact that ban and told michael wolff they're probably i think something like i think i think this is right that ben and told wolf they are probably hundreds of women's been women being paid off suggesting that the daniels probably wasn't the only woman being paid off and given that this is cohen this is the same time period it's the same mo
this woman quite possibly is is also a trump associate can ask any sort of journalistic methodological question that was like a way too many fail samples so i also found myself intrigued insect into this story after resisting reading it because it is entirely speculative and
i sort of feel like look maybe to be true but i wonder if it verges on the kind of irresponsible conspiracy riven thinking on the laugh that the left is so scornful up on the right yeah
yeah i think that's fair having said that do we think not having said that having acknowledged now do we think whiny this is not this is an unrelated but doesn't want to assume that in the materials that have been picked up by investigators that this that the truth of the matter would be
verifiable or could be identified and they're basically the answer to these questions are in somebody his hands right out of blaming assuming those communications between call and greedy and whoever else we're in the records that were seized in the rate of khan's offers i suppose you could think these people and cover their tracks and destroyed their communication
who will say yeah you'd think but then again but then again sixteen burner phone sixteen phone so things weren't destroyed
the way you might expect
and it's it's it but i but i don't want to go to quickly pass the good point about engaging in conspiracy theories i just think i'm losing my own contest to some degree because if something is plausible and you can kind of create this neat
if paul campus had no leg to stand on yeah well the problem is also there's been so many lies told to us and so many so many things in which it's turned out that the the conspiracy has been kind of true we should have learned at least from john edwards that turns out even seemingly squeaky clean politicians
with knows specific history of lying outside of the normal trade craft to politics can engage in bald faced lies in crete baroque coverup attempts and that with president shampoo the martian and post as catalog as having said three thousand things that are in one variant to or another december
ling to all the way to lie that that the press should change its way of thinking about things because it's in a new atmosphere and were in the process of figuring out the new standards while still trying to do the assessing

people with pennsylvania taxpayer dollars the new york attorney general fell hard and fast on monday that day the fearsome journalistic do over on unfair on jane eyre
as an aside can you imagine a more terrifying phone call to get run and pharaoh and jane eyre on the line
that would be terrifying
they published a blockbuster peace in the new yorker detailing at least four cases of violence against women by eric schneiderman often in a sexual context according to the peace schneiderman a democrat and a politician with great ambitions often while drunk would slap and choke girlfriend
women he was dating he would belittle them with abusive language called one his brown slave allegedly schneiderman resigned almost instantaneously denounced by practically everyone who could denounce him including every democratic politician and est one woman in the peace had mentioned her hesitancy to two
reports determines disgusting criminal behavior because he was so valuable to democrats but once he was once this story was out and moralists accepted as truth he was done and dusted and moments and why with he'd gone so fast this with this was definitely the quickest exit i think we've
seen anybody even know think spitzer spitzer took a couple of days
yeah i don't know if you guys were like online watching in real time that it did seem amazingly fast you know first of all jane man run and far from minimal and they had now down the details it just seemed credible and also the women were speaking in this set of specific there are lots of specific date
tales and it had this sense of like more insight than an anger it wasn't like they had an axe to grind it was this like as you said at least one of them was kind of reluctant to come forward and then i think the second part of this is just the me to movement and desire particularly of liberals to be on the right side of it and
to me it was and
reassuring that action item and indeed is expendable as basically like everybody should be expendable if they behave and then an abominable fashion and i don't know what to make of the chasm the time
these validly outwardly feminists champions like schneiderman then we can try to harvey weinstein in this category and then this private behavior which seems utterly at odds with that that seems like sherman's going to have to go figure that out because i addressed
but it's important that everybody be held to a standard way you're not allowed to hit people who don't want to get hit john we talked about eric wright and last week for governor of missouri who's also subjective extremely credible accusations of sexual violence as well as blackmail groans is a republican he remains in office
there are certain and republicans who wish she didn't why why is there a double standard is there are there are two different forms of behavior here between the parties or you just cherry picking to consider it it depends because there's the standard that is implied from the outside and then there's the standard felt from the inside the which is which i guess
contributes to the sense of shame or not shame in then i was trying to think for a republican politician were caught having had an abortion or paid for an abortion whether that would change the internal assessment of shame on shame it's it's it's viability within your own party and we've seen the swift departure
of republican politicians who were engaged with abortion with their balances
so you're saying that they're presumably our sins that conservatives and republicans would find as a parent as democrats are finding
sexual harassment sexual assault sexual violence but it's not it's not necessarily the same sentence as a different set of twins and an abortion i think it's unfortunate since one of them it doesn't mean that they don't care about him at all just met it's just a question of whether
again this combined fang whether it's both
they care enough to kick somebody's out of office or initiate the messy proceedings to do so
when they initiate that and whether the penalty is is large enough for a politician to want to resign and for this
what gentleman's accused of his violence he's not really he's not been accused of any sort of sexual harassment and the officer or and he's not even been really been accused of literary the problem is the violence and then he tried to confuse the picture by talking about role play but there was nothing consensual sounding or role play like in the account
these women and it's really important to think keep those things separate do you guys think there's something wrong with a new york so that's one of the lions that people are making that line the people are doing it's like spitzer wiener schneiderman there's something in the water or is it just that there's an abundance of reporters and journalists are relatively open
culture in the state the one of the amazing facts i found on the new yorker story was one of the women was helped and moving out of schneider mints apartment by another new yorker writer yeah there's so much more interplay between the journalistic world a political world that allows the possibility of being caught maybe is that
or is it just that new yorkers are civil rights and villains i don't think it's of those things i think that these are men with enormous he goes i mean just i did a little bit of reporting relating to schneier ends office a couple years ago and i got that message loud and clear and it's certainly true of wiener
spitzer and so there is a way in which the fact that the city is larger than life or the state i guess
another way although not quite can attract men with these like even bigger egos and there i it to me that's like a common thread here and it's obviously not specific to new york i mean brightens john edwards we can come up with lots of other examples bill clinton can you think that this case has any long term
political impact does affect anything goes
there is going to be an interesting election though in november i mean there's going to be a six month interim appointment i should also say the woman who has the job right now barber underwood is an uber competent liar
new york state's likely to have her but there is like you for your grand oh yeah she works a clip from my grandfather there is this interesting interplay going on and there are opportunities that are opening up and and this is a big job someone's going to get to fill it and it may very well be a woman there a few qualified women who have signalled their interest
butter list although not a little salty little sweet little savory and always smooth screwball the original peanut butter whiskey that's an unexpectedly delicious scruple whiskey dot com the learn more that's with the george response recovery twenty two three school spirit will see new york new york
let's go to cocktail chatter
not really appropriate to make a good cocktail joke given the context of sherman so i will not when you're hungry only i about drug and enrages that don't have a a non alcoholic beverage a maybe just too
glass of juice emily scholastic i don't actually have be children
who don't juice person about t y would drink juice to really hand that's interesting i don't have a feeling about two years ago
i want to chatter about this wonderfully amazing rube goldberg contraption video that maybe old i may be the last person who noticed stand on the internet but i watched it this week and it was so fun it's by joseph her sure he makes comical chain ring
action machines and his it's called joseph's machines his outfit and it test is whimsical and late fall involves a baby and i phone but are melting the delivery of a piece of cake it just has all these lovely touches we will put up the link to it if you have not already watched that you should it's
amazing it's all basement kitchen or some kitchen kitchen like place the baby's behaviors incredible my question to you know who's do think that the
the attraction to rube goldberg machine and wired into the dna but if you showed a rube goldberg machine to any person on earth
they would instinctively understand how amazing and koons or is it it is it is it a learned behavior i kind of go with the universal on also i bet you a lot of monkeys would appreciate it to it just seems like something that a fan of oh or a champ and a point also really groove to is it impossible there's a third option which is
but it's only that it's a learned behavior for some people who like that kind of stuff do you think there are people who don't like goldberg machine oh i totally no way think there are people who look at that and think like was born oh my car so the thing goes to the thing that know i know but that's because we're into process and the wonder enjoy that comes from cork
key things i totally think there are people who would look at images like who cares if the hiring spill i'm interested in anyone who was willing to own up to being such a person is like a little bit like well like and hernia
some of them some of them were perverse people any anybody out there who's and in the audience who doesn't like recorder machine machines not the case against them i would be interested please please the tweet enough that i played benefits
also if i may to say and you can shoot me down from i know you will but i feel like in this case the room
goldberg a new sub this is actually at a higher level than the normal one it's not just a thing crashes into a thing
expanded it has a kind of whimsy and cleverness in the way that it proceeds through its machinations that that i found really particularly so does that mean that if you don't normally lake rube goldberg contraptions you would like this one or that it would seem kind of well over the top to you if you are anti generally
a well this is also further further things to pose to our audience i guess what i would say is if you are hearing this conversation like oh i gotta check that out some day because i'm mildly interested in it i would suggest that perhaps it's worth checking out even before you know you might forget about it because it's really quite it's quite
however and whimsical john what does your chatter
china was inspired by the extraordinary sale of the art collection from the rockefeller the david rockefeller art collection that went on sale this weekend which there were
good yeah monet's man is hoppers picasso's when i was struck by is the age old question of you know
artists who toiled in anonymity and struggle and then there are pieces so one of the moon is when for eighty five million dollars i believe it was a water lily so that's a lot of somalians and do cause me to do some some research at the end of his life money who apparently had some renowned while he was living and and
money and but in in one thousand and eight after three years of working on a new set of paintings and right before they were ready to get packed up in their crates with the straw in the horse hair and sent to paris for the opening of a new exhibit of his work he decided that fifteen of the canvases just weren't doing it for him so he took a knife and a paintbrush to the camp
mrs and basically destroyed them and he decided my life has been nothing but a failure and all that's left for me to do is destroy my paintings before i disappear
it is in addition to the fact that he is a water lilies of which there are two hundred and fifty were totally denigrated and dumb
called awful by critics at the time and this is failing eyesight was blamed for them so i guess what i mean when i feel is that at this point the dollar value placed in the current market is nuts
but it did remind me that your money thought he wasn't doing very well and things have turned out okay for human in life
not for him he's dead my chatter is a fantastic book i just read just came out i think it's called theory of bastards by audrey gentlemen if you like station eleven or he like the road if you are into post apocalyptic kind of road movies poster
