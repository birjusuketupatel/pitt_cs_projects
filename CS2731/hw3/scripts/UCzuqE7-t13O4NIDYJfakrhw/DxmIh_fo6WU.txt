this is democracy now i'm amy goodman
with juan gonzalez
well we continue our coverage of the
right-wing terror incidents across the
country in the last week
11 worshipers at the tree of life
synagogue were killed
saturday in what has been described as
the deadliest anti-semitic attack in u.s
history
the pittsburgh attack came a day after
an avid trump supporter in
florida was arrested and charged with
mailing bombs to more than a dozen
of the president's prominent critics and
three days after
two americans were fatally shot at a
grocery store shortly after the gunman
tried and failed to get
inside a black church a witness told a
local newspaper the gunman said to him
whites don't shoot whites as president
trump prepares to travel to pittsburgh
today
pittsburgh's mayor and some jewish
leaders are urging him
not to come to pittsburgh group
told the president he's not welcome in
pittsburgh until he quote
fully denounces white nationalism
a former president of the tree of life
synagogue described
trump as a purveyor of hate speech
for more we go to oakland california
where we're joined by lois beckett
senior reporter at the guardian covering
gun policy
criminal justice in the far right in the
united states
lois welcome back to democracy now um
can you
talk about what has happened this week
um
the weapons used the people behind these
attacks
so in the discussion that we've had over
these three incidents and especially
these two shootings
one in which the gunman looks like he
initially tried to target a church
and another an attack on a synagogue
we've also often been
talking about this in terms of hate or
political rhetoric and what's really
important to advance the discussion
is to look at the evidence that the
shooter in pittsburgh
was not just anti-semitic that he had
been radicalized
by a white supremacist ideology
we saw in the criminal complaints
against the pittsburgh shooter
that he told a swat officer while in
custody
that he had wanted to kill jews because
jews were trying to commit a genocide on
his people
this is the central conspiracy of
contemporary white supremacist movements
in the united states
the idea that there is a massive plot to
make white people it's extinct
and that everything from immigration to
accepting refugees to feminism to
multiculturalism
that they're all part of this plot it's
really important that we condemn
hate but hate is too general and this
conversation has been really treating
some of these incidents
as if they were just terrible people
with separate terrible ideologies
and certainly in the case of the
louisville shooting
and and the pittsburgh shooting a
sociologist who told
a studies white supremacy told me we
should look at both of these shooters
as radicalized white supremacists and
that naming their ideology is an
important part of
preventing these acts in the future and
lois beckett
both in many of these cases the folks
are
fed or nurtured uh through social media
in fact many of their thoughts or
reporters immediately initially got
through
checking their social media accounts the
time the new york times has a
fascinating story today saying that just
since the
the the shooting uh in the in pittsburgh
on saturday on instagram there were over
11
900 posts with the hashtags
jews did 9 11. so that there's there's
an enormous
uh social media is still being becoming
the main
organizing form for many of these uh
extremists
i'm wondering if you could comment on
that
it's absolutely true that social media
and online spaces have been
become really crucial places for
radicalization um but it's also
important to realize that
these social media platforms are tools
that white supremacists are using
to try to recruit and radicalize people
it's not just sort of hate sort of
mysteriously blossoming these are
organized white supremacist activists
who are trying to exploit platforms and
use them to connect with people
use them to find new followers um and so
we can't look at this as sort of just a
broad problem of how do we fix social
media
how do we fix instagram how do we fix
twitter i think it's important to really
narrow the question
and say twitter instagram facebook
are being exploited by hostile actors
and by terrorists
to recruit people who will commit
violence how do we focus on that
particular problem
how do we how do these companies take
particular responsibility
for white supremacist terror and how
those terrorists are using their
platforms
the robert bowers account on gab
reposted
another user who wrote open your eyes
it's the filthy
evil jews bringing the filthy evil
muslims
into the country um
if you can talk about his
link bower's link a white supremacist
link
between jews and jewish groups were
about to speak to a representative of
haius
he particularly focused on this issue
that a refugee
resettlement organization was bringing
what he called the invaders and um
brian stelter of cnn just looked at
fox news and other right-wing outlets
and saying
the level of times that they are talking
about
invaders just in the last few weeks has
so
escalated and bowers himself said i like
the way they're changing the language of
aliens illegal aliens to
invaders and it's this link of
immigration as president trump now even
as he goes to pittsburgh
tries to divert attention to the border
sending saying he's sending the 5200
soldiers to the border
soon on the border there'll be more
soldiers than in iraq and afghanistan
um sending more than 5 200 soldiers to
the border
and also saying he plans to
through executive order end birthright
citizenship
amy you're pulling all of these
incredibly troubling threads together
and it's really important to recognize
that the
attack of on the tree of life synagogue
in pittsburgh was an attack
on jewish people and the obituaries
of the people who died are just
heart-wrenching but an attack on jewish
people for
supporting refugees an attack
specifically targeted at
an organization that was helping have
shabbat ceremonies in honor of
supporting refugees
and drawing on the jewish history of
persecution
to emphasize how important it is that
people
who are fleeing violence in terror
elsewhere in the world that we have the
capacity to welcome them
and give them a safe place and that that
is a moral duty
uh and in talking to a representative
for highest the particular
uh refugee organization um that the
shooter named
and that he said fueled his rage that he
shared a link uh
to uh synagogues that were hosting these
kinds of events
you know she said that they're still
wrestling with what it means to be
targeted with violence
particularly for fighting for this basic
humanity for treating other people with
basic humanity
and that is what is so incredibly tragic
here uh
that that this congregation and these
people were targeted
um because of their humanitarian
impulses because of support for jews
for refugees for people of color
and that sort of overwhelming
well the anti-defamation league has
found that anti-semitic incidents in the
u.s
rose by 57 in
2017 the largest single year increase
since it started recording such
statistics i'm wondering if you uh
your sense and this is of course not an
isolated situation here in the united
states so there's been a rise in
anti-semitic incidents across
europe as well uh i'm wondering if you
could uh
uh talk about uh the the context in
which this is occurring as more and more
uh right wing
governments are coming to power across
the
industrial world and even in in many
parts of asia and latin america as well
yeah so obviously the context of rising
anti-semitism
is very disturbing and what was
particularly striking about
robert bowers the pittsburgh shooter is
that in looking at his
online profile on gab and the posts that
he made
it was clear that he was channeling a
lot of very ancient anti-semitism that a
lot of the tropes
and the hatred that he was sharing are
very are centuries old that this is not
a new phenomenon and the anti-semitic
violence
is a very old and a very dangerous
ideology but robert bowers was also
someone
who was actively in communication with
other white supremacists
someone who was very familiar with the
events of charlottesville where white
supremacist groups marched through a
university town with torches
chanting jews will not replace us and
some of the statements that he made on
his account
suggests that he was familiar with those
debates about
what people who are white supremacists
in america should do the optics of
different kinds of action
what's going to be most effective for
advancing his white supremacist beliefs
again this belief in an all-white
country that the united states is only a
country for white people
that other people should be shut out or
don't belong here or shouldn't
be allowed to have citizenship and
so that you saw him on this platform
interacting
including interacting with other white
supremacist activists i spoke to one
activist who's an anti-fascist from
charlottesville
who says that she constantly monitors
gab for the harassment of white
supremacists
and she actually got some of these
robert bauer posts
that they she passed them by she saw
them she
had screenshots of a couple of them but
that the kind of hatred that he was
spewing
was so common on this platform that
there were so many dozens and hundreds
of men
sharing equally extreme racist
propaganda
that nothing about what he had said had
stood out to her
that this was someone who had apparently
harassed her directly
directly at some misogynistic nasty
comments
and then appeared to go on to commit a
mass murder at a jewish synagogue
and she said she's still wrestling with
it because what he said on that platform
the kind of hate that he was expressing
was so common
that it didn't stand out it didn't seem
exceptional
pittsburgh mayor bill peduto speaking
about what happened on saturday
the synagogue attack the darkest day of
pittsburgh's history but
said armed guards are not the solution
i think the approach that we need to be
looking at
is how we take the guns
which is the common denominator of every
mass shooting
in america out of the hands
of those that are looking to express
hatred
through murder so that's mayor peduto he
also said that president trump
should not come today to pittsburgh that
they are busy
burying the dead this is president trump
right after
the massacre talking about armed guards
if they had protection inside the
results would have been
far better this is a dispute that will
always exist i suspect but
if they had some kind of a protection
inside the temple maybe it could have
been a very much different
situation they didn't and he was able to
to do things that unfortunately he
shouldn't have been able to do i hear
the police
were outstanding i heard the police did
an incredible job and as you know
numerous police were badly injured so
that was president trump calling for
armed guards
in the synagogues um lois beckett if you
could talk about this and
also i mean as we're talking about this
violence you have
greg bush in the louisville area in
jeffersontown
he has numerous weapons
not clear whether he has them legally he
had to hand them over because of his
violent background again so often we see
the links to domestic violence
in their past but why these men are able
to have these guns of course
bowers used an ar-15
these linkages to violence and this
might you might think of as a stretch
but
because you are a guardian reporter i'm
thinking about your colleague ben jacobs
um who was body slammed by the montana
congress member who had to plead guilty
to criminal assault and why i'm bringing
that up now
is president trump just last week
held a rally in montana where he
applauded uh gianforte for
body slamming your colleague at
the guardian this in the midst of
the investigation into the murder of
jamal khashoggi with president trump
taking the side of the
saudi leadership and not to mention
the cnn mail bombs and president trump
has not stopped attacking the media all
week
so one thing i want to say that's
tremendously important
in these times where the amount of
violence
and the partisan intensity seems so
overwhelming
is that being a gun owner in america is
not a radical thing
in this country this may not be not
everyone may agree with this but in this
country it is a normal thing to be a gun
owner
millions tens of millions of americans
own guns roughly a third of households
our gun owning households
um so i think it's really important not
to indiscriminately lump together
a lot of different issues um but to say
that there is a differ
a big difference between being a gun
owner in america
and even being someone who is skeptical
of new regulations wanting to
to really understand how much that they
will help um
and being someone who is advocating for
instance
violence against journalists or uh
thinking that it is
funny or cute that a politician might
physically attack a journalist who is
trying to ask him a question about
health care
that it might be appropriate to praise
or to
joke about that a politician who
then went on to make false statements to
the police whose spokesperson
made false statements to the police
about that attack and about who was
responsible for it
um it's just a time that uh there are so
many different issues and they're so
overwhelming
that the chaos is is purposeful
um but one thing that's really important
to remember is that there's also
tremendous advocacy
if you're if you care about the issue of
gun control uh the students from
parkland florida
uh who survived the mass shooting um at
their school there in february
have been working since that time all of
these months over their summer vacation
now into the fall they've been traveling
across the country
trying to get out the vote for other
young people um working very hard to
mobilize 18 year olds 19 year olds 20
year olds
to bring this new post-columbine
generation that is so frustrated with
school shootings that is so frustrated
with active shooter drills
and trying to get them to the polls so
one thing that's incredibly important to
remember is that this midterm elections
upon so many issues seem to be riding is
going to be a referendum on the future
of gun control in america
and there are many organizations that
are working very hard to vote out
politicians that
uh just absolutely refuse to pass any
new gun control laws
and to bring in politicians that support
uh gun safety
and some additional regulations and so
this is something that
uh you know even though it's not always
in the headlines now there's um
so much going on um that it's you should
remember the parkland kids are out there
they are fighting for this
um and this is an issue that they're
working for at the polls if this is an
issue that you care about
there's still time before the election
to work on getting out the vote
to focusing on making sure that people
support that support the issues that you
care about
uh get out to the polls so i think it's
really important to remember
in the midst of all of this incredible
tension and violence um that there's
real
uh advocacy work going on and there's
collaborations going on and the parkland
kids have collaborated with students
from inner cities
