report i'm amy goodman we begin today's
show in zimbabwe where long-time leader
robert mugabe is refusing to resign as
president amidst a growing political
crisis in zimbabwe members of zimbabwe's
ruling party are preparing to meet to
discuss mugabe's impeachment after the
deadline for him to resign came and went
this morning
on sunday mugabe gave a televised
address acknowledging the country's
problems but did not mention stepping
down
whatever the pros and cons
of the way they went about
registering those concerns
as the president of zimbabwe
and as their commander-in-chief
do acknowledge
the issues they have drawn my attention
to
and do believe
that these were raised in the spirit of
honesty
and out of deep and patriotic
concern
for the stability of our nation
of greater concern
to our commanders
are the well-founded fears
that the lack of unity
and commonness
of purpose in both party and government
was translating into perceptions
of
inattentiveness
to the economy
open public
spirits
between high-ranking officials
in the party and government
exacerbated
by multiple conflicting messages from
both the party and government
made the criticisms leveled against us
inescapable
zimbabwe's ruling party zanu-pf has
expelled mugabe and first lady grace
mugabe from the party mugabe had been
working to hand over power to his wife
grace the impeachment proceedings
against mugabe may now begin as soon as
tuesday
last week president mugabe was placed
under house arrest after zimbabwe's
military seized parliament courts
government offices and the main airport
in the capital harare the apparent coup
came a week after president mugabe
ousted his vice president emerson
munangwa the military says it's
appointed him as the interim president
of zimbabwe on sunday after a week of
relative calm residents in harare took
to the streets to celebrate the expected
announcement of mugabe's resignation
only to be disappointed by his refusal
to step down
we're expecting to hear the president
say i've heard your concerns yesterday
and i'm ready to step down
this wasn't this is not what we're
expecting to hear a long speech without
any results for us the results were
simple i am stepping down i am handing
over the country to someone else robert
mugabe has held power since zimbabwe
declared independence
37 years ago well for more we're joined
by glenn mampani mason fellow at the
kennedy school of government at harvard
university in cambridge massachusetts
democracy and governance practitioner
who's worked for the last 15 years in
africa his recent op-ed in the new york
times is headlined for zimbabwe a coup
isn't the answer glenn and pani welcome
to democracy now can you talk about what
is the latest in zimbabwe and give us
background on how to understand it
thank you so much it's good to be on
your show
as you are away
zimbabwe has been confronted with an
economic and political crisis for the
last 20 years
the crisis has been largely due to bad
governance centralization of power
and the inability of the zanu-pf
government to be able to provide
alternative solutions to address the
economic crisis
the crisis has also resulted in the
countries being placed on sanctions it
has resulted in multiples of zimbabwe
fleeing the country to go to other
countries to be able to ache and living
and if you look at some of the key
things that have been a major challenge
for a day-to-day zimbabwe unemployment
is at 98 percent
they are shortages of water electricity
and cash within the country so these are
some of the major economic issues that
have been a problem
but with major concern the last three
four years there have been issues that
have to do deal with succession within
zanu-pf
and within zanu-pf they have been two
major factions that have been
trying to ensure that they can be able
to succeed mugabe one of the factions
was led by the
former vice president amazon nangagwa
was booted out a couple of weeks from
zanu-pf and the other faction was led by
the first lady grace mugabe
which is which the president of zumba
mugabe is regarded to have been part of
so this jostling for position
reached fever peace a couple of weeks
ago when
there was the explosion of the vice
president from
his post as the vice president of the
country as a result that he was feigning
he was promoting factionalism
and in that process a free fall event
took place
where we saw the security
which has been very close to vice
president managua aligning themselves to
it and initially moving in to ensure
that they can be able to restore him
on the other side the faction that was
aligned to the first lady was pushing to
ensure that they page all the structures
and ensure that they align them with the
function of the first lady so what we
are confronted with here
is factional issues or intraparty
disagreements within xanopf that have
largely spread into a national crisis
and unfortunately there has been now a
convergence of issues where zimbabweans
the general public is tired of the
leadership of zanu-pf and they've been
saying it for many many years and now we
have one individual who everyone is an
agreement that they should go we've got
a faction in zanubf that would not want
him to stay in the generality of
zimbabwe that would not want him to be
there so there is
a common enemy on the ground to say
let's get him out but there are no
answers that people need to pick out
the nuances are as follows
the xanopia faction that is pushing for
this
in all intents and purposes is not
sincere in terms of economic recovery
and democratization of zimbabwe they are
simply doing it simply because they want
to install one of their own
and the people rallying with them
they are using it as an opportunity
for them to be able to gain legitimacy
for them to be able to sanitize
themselves as a pro-democratic movement
but in essence that is not their agenda
and their
cause so talk about
for people who are not familiar with
zimbabwe's history 37 years ago gaining
independence from england it used to be
called rhodesia for cecil rhodes
robert mugabe a leading independence
activist as was
his vice president who has just been
appointed president give us the history
of zimbabwe in africa
zimbabwe attained independence in 1980
and offered a lot of hope for the
continent i think if you look at the
east of zimbabwe we're regarded as the
breadbasket of the continent we largely
were
able to produce
commodities such as
tobacco we were able to feed ourselves
and feed other regions on the continent
we're able to have a very robust and
vibrant
education system our health sector was
very effective and
we
were proud as a country for us to be
able to
provide a shining example in terms of
how a country can be able to transition
from
from colonial role
but what remained
post-independent 1980 was that we had
the dominance of zanu-pf
regardless of the dominance of zanu-pf
there and the existence of zappo as an
opposition party we should likely also
play the very pivotal role during the
liberation struggle
we focused more on the economy and paid
very little attention in terms of the
politics so the idea of centralizing
authority and power remained a key
tenant of the zanubf government but
unfortunately because there was
very little opposition to them there was
less attention that was paid to them
because they were darling of the west
the british loved them so much donors
were pouring money into zimbabwe
but
at the
in
pre-2000
when they went on to introduce
the imf
conditions for them to be able to reform
the economy
we started noticing one
um
[Music]
the
cutting down of the social base
levels of unemployment increased
there was now high inflation
in this in instance
led to the rise of the zimbabwe congress
of trade union the largest labor
movement that resulted in the formation
of the now major political party in
zimbabwe the movement for democratic
change
this ushered in a new a new era within
zimbabwean politics where the zimbabwe
congress of trade union was now
challenging the government to say
one day there are high levels of
corruption
to the basic livelihood issues of an
ordinary zimbabweans cannot be met and
this resulted in the formation of an
opposition in this opposition since 2000
he has successfully been successively
been
participating in elections which have
largely been seniors unfair
in way it has been seen to have won but
unfortunately because of the military
this military that has just intervened
which played a role in
instituting violence
rigging of elections
inflicting rep appraisals on key
activists
it became very very difficult for any
prospect of an opposition
being able to get into office through an
electoral process i recall there was
even an instance where all these
generals had to do a press conference
where they categorically stated that in
no way would they allow
anyone who has never fought in the
liberation struggle to be a leader of
zimbabwe and true to their word they
have been very consistent and if you see
what is currently happening they are
making sure because the default is
regarded as a faction within zanu-pf of
young people who don't have liberation
credentials so true to their word they
the insistence of them intervening to
have naga come in as their candidate
is in line with their agenda that they
will never accept anyone who doesn't
have liberation glenn and penny i wanted
to ask you about zimbabwe's opposition
leader morgan changarai who you were
talking about returned to zimbabwe from
south africa reportedly discussing plans
to form a government of national unity
with emerson munangwa uh who the
military has pointed as in interim
president changurai served press prime
minister under mugabe from 2009-13
former labor activist who was repeatedly
arrested by zimbabwean authorities
subject to beatings torture while in
jail we only have a minute and a half
but if you can talk about um both
changurai menagua and the power of the
first lady
as well if you can talk about the power
of grace mugabe and where she fits into
this now also expelled from the party
let me start with the first lady i think
the first lady
made a greater disservice to mugabe
whose image had already been eroded i
think she overstretched her hand she
overplayed their hand
and in essence
was he did not manage to be able to
play an effective role in ensuring that
mugabe can steer this succession agenda
she played a very divisive role and
unfortunately this has culminated into
this and if you listen to most
zimbabweans they expressed greater
revulsion
and hatred in terms of what she has done
because in essence she caused this to be
able to implode
so if you have to move away from looking
at graces so moving forward is a factor
i don't see as a factor
i think if she's going to play a role
she'll play a role within xanopf that is
if they want it but from the signs that
are there they've expelled here and i
don't think there'll be an opportunity
from gabe leaves i don't think she have
any opportunity in
in any realignment or in the future
politics or zimbabwe this might actually
be the end of a political career
when it comes to munagwa
i think they can come up with an
alliance of convenience
where they can say let's have an a an
interim arrangement or a transitional
government but i don't see that coming
bringing any in any
any meaningful change it can bring
relief in an interim phase but it will
not work
both of them are desperate manager wants
legitimates he wants international
acclaim
morgan shangri is desperate he also
wants to get into government considering
that is not also feeling well so they
are joined together by their he's
undergoing cancer treatment right
that's undergoing cancer treatment but
in terms of the greater good i see an
elite pact
i don't see any substantive reforms in
terms of them coming out of this process
i don't think all still have the
appetite for them to push an agenda so
unfortunately if citizens in zimbabwe
don't challenge whatever deals or
decisions
that whatever interim arrangement is
going to come up with they will realize
that they will have another 37 years
when the status quo remains because now
elite interests and selfish interests
are now taking precedence
over what is needs to be done in terms
of reforming zimbabwe i want to thank
you so much glam and pani for joining us
