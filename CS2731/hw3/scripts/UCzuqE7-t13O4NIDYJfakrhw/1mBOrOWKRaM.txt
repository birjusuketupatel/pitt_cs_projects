AMY GOODMAN: We then sat down with Aura Hernández,
the Guatemalan mother who’s taken sanctuary
in the church.
She was holding her baby Camila as she slept.
Democracy Now!’s Laura Gottesdiener and
I conducted this first broadcast interview
she has done, and I began by asking Aura how
she knows that ICE, Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, is trying to deport her.
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] Before, I was
in check-in at immigration, and at immigration
they told me that in 30 days I had to go back
to my country.
And so I decided to confront the situation.
That’s why I know that I have to not hide
myself, not hide myself, but protect myself,
protect my family and my children.
LAURA GOTTESDIENER: Aura, could you tell us
a little bit about your family, about your
two children?
I can see Camila there sleeping in your lap.
Can you tell us about your children that you’re
here to protect?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] Yes, my first
child, Daniel, and my daughter, Camila, we’re
here.
Well, it’s quite difficult for me.
I have a child who is 10 years old and who
knows that his mother is going through this
situation.
It’s not easy for him.
And my daughter can’t speak yet, but she
feels that anguish that I feel, of not knowing
what’s going to happen to us, and the fear
of saying, “I can’t go up to the window
because I’m scared to see.
Maybe they’re going to be having me under
surveillance.
Maybe they’re checking on me to see how
I might be careless.
I might step out of the church, and then they
can arrest me.”
AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about where you
came from, when you came to this country,
how long you have lived here?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] OK.
I am from Guatemala.
I came here in 2005.
And I came fleeing from my country because
of domestic violence.
And I decided to come to this country to protect
myself.
I entered this country in 2005, and I practically
didn’t want to come.
I was forced to come here.
AMY GOODMAN: And what was that journey like
for you?
What happened when you came over the border?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] I crossed the
border, as I told you, in July.
I took 22 days to travel from Guatemala to
the border of Mexico and the United States.
And I entered in Texas, Harlingen, Texas.
Somebody took me across on a raft.
I crossed the river.
Then I walked about a kilometer, and I was
detained by the Border Patrol.
They detained me, and they took me to a detention
center.
At the detention center, well, I was there
for three days.
Those days I had extremely bad experiences
there.
They treat me worse than an animal there.
It is so cold, it burns.
So, now, I don’t want my children to go
through that.
I don’t want to go back.
I want to have my family with me and protect
them as best 
I can.
LAURA GOTTESDIENER: Aura, can you tell us
a little bit more about the conditions inside
the detention center?
How were you treated?
And how did you feel about that treatment?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] I am going to
speak out to protect my family.
And what I’m going to tell you right now
is very difficult for me, but I have to tell
you.
I’m going to say this, because I don’t
want to stay silent, because that would mean
that they won.
And that’s not the case.
When I entered the detention center, they
put us in a cell.
I was accompanied by my nephew.
So, an agent from the Border Patrol, the agent
who takes the information, began to insult
me, to tell me things, like sexual things.
And I knew, because of the experiences I’ve
had since I was young, that this was not going
well, that this was going in a direction—well,
I practically knew where it was going.
That immigration agent took me to an office
and sexually abused me.
AMY GOODMAN: When you asked to have your nephew
with you, he said no?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] The agent—well,
my nephew was coming behind me on our way
to the office.
When he realized that my nephew was coming
with me, he stopped him, and he said, “Not
you.
You go over there.
I don’t want you to come with.”
And he said, “You stay there, and I’m
going to work with your aunt; otherwise, you’re
not going to get out of here.”
And he sent him to the cell.
AMY GOODMAN: How long were you held at this
detention facility?
And then, how did you get out, and where did
you go, Aura?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] After the person
abused me, he sent me to a cell.
I was in that cell for three days.
But before that, he told me that since I did
not cooperate with him, he wasn’t going
to let me go.
So I spent three days in that cell, until
another immigration agent saw that I was still
in that situation at the detention center.
And he asked me why was I in the cell, if
I should have been released by then.
And the person who took me out of the cell
said, “Ma’am, we’re leaving.”
At that time, I thought that something else
was going to happen to me.
When the agent took me out of the cell, I
didn’t know what was going to happen to
me or my nephew, until the person told me—well,
they didn’t tell me anything.
They took me in a patrol car and took me to
a bus transportation office.
When I got out of the patrol car at the office,
he said, “Welcome to the United States.”
LAURA GOTTESDIENER: Aura, did you face any
other threats while you were in detention?
And given all this, why have you chosen to
speak out now?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] When the person
who abused me, right then and there, he said,
“I have your information.
I have your information, and I know where
you are.”
That’s why for many years I did not speak
out.
I hushed up.
They gave me some documents.
What did I do with those documents?
I put them in the dresser with everything
that had happened to me.
I wanted to leave all that behind.
I wanted to leave it in the past.
But in 2013, I went back to that dark past,
feeling tormented.
One Sunday, I was headed to church, and I
was stopped by the police for a traffic violation,
and he reported me to immigration.
He told me that I had a deportation order
dating to 2005 for having failed to appear
at immigration, at a court.
But I didn’t know that at the time.
I didn’t want to know anything about those
documents.
I knew that those documents existed, but I
didn’t want to review anything.
Well, mainly, I didn’t even know English
at that time.
In 2013, I looked for a lawyer.
What struck him was that, well, I told him
that I didn’t want to talk because something
happened to me at the border.
And this struck him.
And he asked me: Did I need a psychologist,
in order to be able to speak?
And he helped me in that regard.
And he told me there were possibilities of
obtaining a U visa.
AMY GOODMAN: So, can you talk about today,
what it means to have been welcomed into this
church, the Unitarian church where you have
taken sanctuary, and how long you plan to
stay here?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] How do I feel
here in sanctuary?
When I came here, I was looking for help,
protection.
And I found good people.
I found something that I didn’t find in
my own church.
I always had the church, but I didn’t have
this in my community, at the church that I
went to regularly.
And I came here, and I found an affection
that I thought didn’t exist.
And so here I am.
I wouldn’t say that I’m happy, but I feel
protected here.
I feel that here I can raise up my voice,
that I’m going to be bold enough to be able
to speak out and to say what I feel, what
I want and what I really deserve.
I deserve a better life.
I and my children, my family, we deserve it.
Because they take your freedom away.
They tell you you have to go.
It’s so easy to say, and it doesn’t matter.
It’s of no interest to me.
They say, “Just go.”
When they say, “Go,” it’s as though
they’re—well, they’re saying this to
children, first of all, who aren’t to blame
for anything.
But they have rights.
They have rights, and I have rights here,
as well.
And they are trampling our rights.
I’m not just struggling with this situation
under this administration.
I’ve been struggling since 2013.
Before, not everything was said, but now they
shamelessly tell you things.
“From up on high, they are requiring me,”
they say, “to get rid of you.”
I don’t know how long I’m going to be
here, but I’m certain that it’s not going
to be too long, because I’m going to speak
out.
I’m not going to let them get away with
this any longer.
AMY GOODMAN: We just interviewed the senior
minister here at the Unitarian church, and
he said he’s willing to be arrested to protect
you.
What does that mean to you?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] There is no
doubt that I did not make a mistake coming
here.
It really makes me feel strong to know that
a person who I just met, we just began have
communication, and that he is capable of being
arrested—for me.
Well, that’s priceless.
And it pushes me to continue struggling to
stay here in this country, because I deserve
it.
I think that all these years that I’ve lived
here and everything that has happened to me,
well, I think that I have rights, and I have
to stay here.
LAURA GOTTESDIENER: Aura, I want to ask you,
by speaking out, what do you hope will happen?
What are you demanding?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] First is to
get out of here.
Then I want to continue struggling, because
now I want more people to speak out about
everything that’s happened to them.
And I hope—and this is my goal—that other
persons will raise their voices, that they
can be bolder and not be fearful and not hide
anymore, as I did, to be fearful to go to
the park with your children because you’re
scared that they might arrest you, to be scared
that the slightest mistake you might make
driving.
Well, they can label you a criminal.
That’s what they’re doing.
They’re labeling you as a criminal.
What I want out of this is to raise up my
voice, and that other people who are in the
same situation as I am speak out and defend
themselves.
Because here, what’s going to get me out
of here is raising my voice, not staying hushed
up, and not just wait for others to do things
for me, but rather, I, myself, need to take
the initiative to get out of here by speaking
and not staying hushed up.
AMY GOODMAN: Your daughter, Camila, who you’re
holding right now, who’s asleep in your
lap, she’s 14 months old, and Danny, your
son, is 10.
And they are both U.S. citizens.
What would happen to them and to you if you’re
deported to Guatemala?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] If that situation
were to come to pass, then I would take my
children with me.
I would not leave them here.
But if I took them to my country, then I’m
giving up.
But when they’re adults, they’d be able
to come back.
What do they even come back to?
To clean dishes?
Because they don’t have English.
There is education there.
They can get an education, but it’s not
like the education here.
I think that that’s the right that they
have, because of having been born in the United
States.
And I think it’s not fair for them.
They have the same rights, because they were
born here.
AMY GOODMAN: And what would happen to you,
Aura?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] The deepest
fear I have here, that makes me want to stay
here, is that if I go back to my country,
I might be assassinated.
I might be murdered.
That’s why I’m struggling here, because
I don’t want to take my daughter with me.
I can’t go back to my country.
I can’t.
I am in danger of death.
And that would mean the destruction of my
family.
I’m in danger of being killed.
AMY GOODMAN: Why do you think you would be
killed?
Why do you think you would be assassinated?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] I can’t tell
you exactly who or why, because that could
put my family at risk.
AMY GOODMAN: Finally, your thoughts on President
Trump?
AURA HERNÁNDEZ: [translated] Good question.
I don’t hate him, because that would mean
being bitter all the time.
But I think that his heart is very much embittered,
we could say.
And we have to pray to God to soften his heart,
because it’s very hard.
And it’s not that we’re asking for compassion.
That’s not the case.
But he should have a softer heart.
I can’t really wish anything bad for a person
who I don’t even know, but he has done a
lot of harm to me.
I can’t say that this or that should happen
to him.
No, I can’t, because he’s also a human
being.
And as a human being, I think that he loves
his children.
The only thing is that his heart is very hard,
and so I would ask God to soften his heart,
so that he not hate us so much.
AMY GOODMAN: That’s Aura Hernández, who’s
taken sanctuary in the Fourth Universalist
Society in New York City, where she’ll be
holding a news conference today with her supporters
after they take a silent walk from Trump International
Hotel at Columbus Circle up to the church
on the Upper West Side overlooking Central
Park, the Unitarian church where she’s taken
refuge.
Special thanks to Cinthya Santos for providing
additional photos, and to Malav Kanuga and
Democracy Now!'s Laura Gottesdiener.
We'll link to their series in The Nation,
which chronicles another Guatemalan mother
who’s taken sanctuary in yet another church
in upper Manhattan.
As we continue to cover the sanctuary movement
around the country, we’ll also link to our
interviews with mothers in sanctuary in churches
in Carbondale and Denver, Colorado.
And thanks to Charlie Roberts, Simin Farkhondeh,
Charina Nadura and John Hamilton.
I’m Amy Goodman, with Laura Gottesdiener.
We’ll be back in 30 seconds.
