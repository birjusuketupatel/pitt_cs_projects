is democracy now democracynow.org the
war and peace report i'm amy goodman we
begin today's show in spain where
thousands are expected to gather outside
catalonia's parliament in barcelona this
evening when regional president carlos
puigdemont is expected to declare
independence from spain this is
pujnaman's first address to parliament
following an october first referendum
that produced an overwhelming vote for
secession and provoked a standoff with
the spanish government which ruled the
vote illegal tonight's announcement
could trigger intervention by spanish
forces
puchdemont originally promised to
declare independence within 48 hours of
a victory for the secessionist campaign
but has instead called for negotiations
barcelona's mayor ada kalau said monday
the results of the referendum are not
enough to declare independence but also
urge spain's prime minister mariano
rajoy to help decrease tension by
removing thousands of state police
who've been deployed to the region
they ask you to immediately revert the
intervention on the catalan institutions
and to withdraw the extra police
deployed in catalonia these are
indispensable steps to open a dialogue
and recover institutional normality this
comes after hundreds of thousands
rallied in barcelona sunday in a massive
unity rally opposing independence for
the country's catalonia region pro-unity
organizers said their slogan let's
recover our common sense is aimed at
generating dialogue with the rest of
spain their supporters include nobel
prize-winning novelist maria vargas yosa
and the former president of the european
parliament joseph burrell organizers
said nearly a million people attended
the rally while catalan police put the
number at 350 000. in either case the
rally was larger than a mass
pro-independence mobilization last week
the rally came as catalan leaders
claimed about 90 percent of those who
voted in a banned referendum a week ago
supported independence spain's
government called the independence drive
unconstitutional and a police crackdown
on the vote left over 900 people injured
on monday a spokesman for spain's
governing people's party compared
catalan's president
puchdeman to the former catalan
president luis compinus who was jailed
after declaring a catalan republic in
1934.
he was exiled in france after the
spanish civil war and later extradited
by nazi authorities and killed by a
firing squad in 1940 under the franco
dictatorship
last october 6 the 83rd anniversary of
companies declaration of independence
passed almost unnoticed
i believe history shouldn't be repeated
let's hope tomorrow
nothing will be declared because maybe
the one who declares it will end as the
one who declared it 83 years ago
well catalans who support the
independence referendum have had help
from wikileaks founder julian assange
who tweeted hundreds of times in the
days leading up to the referendum
including a video that advised catalans
how to communicate and organize through
secure channels this is a clip
the spanish state security is is
repressive uh towards the catalonian
population
make it easy uh for them to understand
the structure of catalonian society who
speaks to who what do they speak about
who's important who's not important etc
so
you protect yourself you protect your
friends
if you protect your friends you protect
your community if you protect the
community you protect the whole society
in a situation like this where there is
a serious repression
developing
uh against people who are trying to
communicate their political desires
uh then actually we have a
responsibility
a burden falls upon us those people who
understand
to try and
teach
everyone else
that's wikileaks founder and
editor-in-chief julian assange in a
video he posted to twitter for more
assange joins us now from the ecuadorean
embassy in london julian welcome back to
democracy now talk about what's
happening in catalonia and why you're so
interested in it and the kind of aid
that you provided technical aid
good morning amy
i don't have a position on independence
itself i think that's a matter for
catalonians but that is precisely the
point uh they are 7.5 million people
uh they
clearly form a people
under that definition and therefore they
have a right to self-determination and
that can either be provided for by the
spanish state or if it cannot be
provided for within the spanish state
then they have a right to make their way
outside of the spanish state
but
i want to speak about significance
because most of americans will think
well it's it's spain it's some regional
issue
involving spain why does it matter
this is the most significant
change of relationship between
population and state in western europe
since the fall of the berlin wall and
its effects will spread all over western
europe uh and into the united states and
because it's spain
also substantially into latin america
spanish speaking latin america
why do you feel that way
okay uh
the conflict that the conflict that is
occurring let's just background a little
bit
uh
barcelona is the capital of
catalonia people will be familiar
perhaps more familiar with that city
than the region that's very interesting
that in some sense reflects the
suppression that has been uh happening
in catalonia over many years so there
has been this struggle for catlins
to maintain their language and culture
over 300 years
of spanish colonialism of various
various forms and this
really uh became
it's been severe over a long period of
time for example captain language being
banned as each new technological
development came along so for example
uh or cultural development plays for
example banned when printing press
became a
cheap and accessible printed writing
banned in katlin when the telephone
uh
entered in the late uh 19th century
to spain speaking kathleen on the
telephone was banned under franco
speaking catlin in public banned
teaching it in school
likewise band and then an attempted
ethnic dilution of catalonia
pushing
spaniards from other provinces such as
andy lucia into the catalan population
to try and dilute them so
they've had this struggle for a long
period of time
[Music]
they'd
a distinct
culture
somewhere perhaps uh between france and
spanish the language is perhaps closer
to
uh closer to french
okay so so that's the grounds a very
long-term struggle an independent an
independent culture are trying to
gain self-realization
i think
that
looked at
looked at it correctly that world war ii
began
in spain it did it began as a proxy war
in spain that was a spanish civil war
and now we have a perception
uh
english-speaking westerners have a
perception uh that the fascists lost
world war two that's false that's false
they won world war ii in spain
franco won in spain and he continued on
uh with us backing
up until 1975 when he died peacefully in
his bed
there was not a revolution in spain
there was not an occupation that set the
reset button on the existing uh
families and institutions and class
structure in spain franco died
peacefully in his bed
and
an example of the rollover then that
then occurred uh is that seven of his
ministers went on to found the party
that would become what is now the ruling
party pp uh in spain which is headed up
by prime minister rahul
um so those uh
facets of uh
undealt with frankivism
uh
penetrated into the
uh systems of the judiciary uh the
bureaucracy and
significantly into the culture and
though those are what have led to this
conflict this impasse
let's let's look at you've got um
a population that is becoming more
powerful in catalonia for one reason or
another relative to the state
of spain
now that would normally mean that the
state of spain has to engage in some
kind of negotiation process it has to uh
be nicer to catalonians make them feel
more comfortable make them feel not as
scared
give them some kind of concession
increased autonomy etc confederation
something like that
instead instead the response has been to
react to this political
uh condition over the last 10 years
with
judicialization of politics no we say
it's illegal
fundamentally illegal for cut for
catlins to increase their
self-determination uh
and it's therefore it's not going to
happen
that uh brutalness that judicialization
of politics comes from the in my view
comes from the remnants
of how the
uh 78 regime was formed in the
transition
from franco with
the u.s ushering in
that process
with the king
so it's
it's
um
now led to to this impasse
uh
there's another factor as well which is
the right-wing government of rahui is
tru is in a very weak position uh it was
only elected on 20 of the vote uh 20 of
the population uh it's a minority
government and it has been racked by
corruption scandals uh every few days
there's news about corruption scandal
and prime minister rahul was forced uh
to testify about a month ago in relation
to one of those corruption scandals this
is very very serious it's equivalent to
barack obama or donald trump being
forced to testify uh about a corruption
situation i wanted to turn to so so
the the government is instead of trying
to
negotiate or conciliate uh with the
struggle for cattle and independence is
instead
uh taking a maximally hard line
and instead provoking
uh
moves towards catalan independence
including as you mentioned uh just
yesterday
threatening to
arrest
the president of catalonia and even
perhaps have him killed end up
like the previous
president who declared independence who
was shot by franco firingsport i wanted
to turn to spain's finance minister
luis dubindos who said europe's
center-right finance ministers support
spain's central government in dismissing
catalonia's independence referendum
everyone has supported the position of
the spanish government this is not about
independence this is about a rebellion
against the rule of law the law is the
basis of not only daily life in spain
but in all of europe
award-winning filmmaker isabel coycette
told el pais newspaper not being an
independent teasta doesn't make you a
fascist it simply means that we think
feeling catalan and spanish are not
antagonistic concepts uh the filmmaker
isabelle quachet also told the guardian
the debate about national identity has
drowned out all other issues she said
i'm still waiting for someone to tell me
what the new catalan republic is going
to be like she says frankly i find it
hard to tell the difference between a
right-wing centralist party and another
one that is catalan nationalist now she
was quoted saying all this before police
attacked uh the referendum vote and
heard over 900 people
julian
yeah i mean this is it's it's it's
pretty tiresome you know you see the
so-called left uh in turkey what do they
support kurdish independence or do they
oppose it they oppose it uh you see
so-called left in uh the socialist party
in spain do they support uh catalan
self-determination or they oppose it
they oppose it so the same thing happens
everywhere that
the mainstream
uh left if you like the equivalent to
the democratic party uh in the united
states
well
their um their ambitions are
most fulfilled their their personal or
group power is most fulfilled by
merging with the state itself and
therefore they become an app they become
part of the state apparatus but the only
way to keep the state honest in the
ultimate calculation is that people have
the right to say that they've had enough
as individuals to leave
and as a
peoples or an area uh to push uh towards
succession or some kind of new or some
kind of new deal so i i find that
yeah a bit a bit frankly a bit tasteful
but i want us i want to speak about this
let me julian let me just i i want to
read you another quote but i mean in
terms of the film director uh isabel
quichette i don't think you could
describe her as equivalent to the
mainstream democratic party in the
united states i mean people who are
deeply anti-fascist of course were
auntie franco
also concerned but again this was before
the violent attack by the spanish police
but let me read to you from the
washington post what ann applebaum wrote
describing you and i want to get your
response to it she wrote with the aim of
dividing people julian assange of
wikileaks who had showed no prior
interest in spanish constitutional
politics suddenly threw himself into the
catalan referendum campaign beginning on
september 9th began tweeting his demands
for a referendum and his attacks on the
spanish government rapidly becoming the
most quoted international commentator on
the subject on twitter similar to the
tactics used in the u.s election he was
helped in this effort by russian state
media as well as a network of internet
trolls and automated bots which spread
his comments further the
spanish-language edition of sputnik a
russian state news website has mentioned
and quoted assange and headlines more
often than it did either the spanish
prime minister or the president of the
catalan assembly the motives are clear
enough anything that divides a european
country is good for russia can you
respond to what she wrote in the
washington post julian assange
yeah well this is an ann appleborg she's
a neocon she's the wife of the former
uh polish foreign minister and she she
applies her her trade of slander so i
it's all false um
i i suppose that it's a positive sign in
some way that you know
that some people will
see that there's some impact but the
russian state has formally opposed it so
they were nowhere on this the russian
media was nowhere on this situation i
think
they're actually they're probably
concerned that
a successful
or apparently successful
independence push by catalonia will lead
to
similar pushes in baluchistan and so on
so they're mixed interestingly the
the u.s mainstream press and the uk
mainstream press
is substantially supportive of the
the catalan effort
that's that's either because there's no
u.s or uk interest in the matter
and therefore journalists are simply
free to to write uh what is most
appealing and interesting to their
readers
or because there is a slight
uk u.s interest
a new a new state of course will need
new friends uh we'll need new arms we'll
need new intelligence uh the uk is in
its brexit negotiations and so
uh the eu having another thing to deal
with
uh can
uh
yeah
lessen the capacity of the
eu to bully the uk during its
negotiations
we're in a break and then come back to
our discussion we're talking to julian
assange founder and editor-in-chief of
wikileaks is um
well has taken refuge in the ecuadorean
embassy for well over four years now um
for fear of being arrested by the
british police and uh we'll talk to you
about that julian your status in the
embassy right now given that sweden is
no longer seeking your extradition why
you have to remain in the embassy this
is democracy now we'll be back with
julian assange in a minute
