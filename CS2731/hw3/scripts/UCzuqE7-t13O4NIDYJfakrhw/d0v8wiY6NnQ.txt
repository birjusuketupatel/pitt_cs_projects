the war and peace report
i'm amy goodman and i'm juan gonzalez
welcome to all of our listeners and
viewers around the country and around
the world
president trump has repeatedly attacked
his political opponents by saying the
world is quote laughing at the united
states
but on tuesday as he addressed the
united nations general assembly many of
the world's leaders
laughed at him when he boasted of his
administration's accomplishments
in less than two years my administration
has accomplished more than
almost any administration in the history
of our country
america's so true
didn't expect that reaction but that's
okay
trump later said his comment was quote
meant to get some laughter so it was
great
during his address trump assailed the
international criminal court
accused venezuelan president nicolas
maduro of corruption
and announced new sanctions against
members of maduro's inner circle
and he accused iran of sowing chaos
death and destruction across the middle
east
iran's leaders so chaos
death and destruction
they do not respect their neighbors or
borders
or the sovereign rights of nations
instead iran's leaders plunder the
nation's resources
to enrich themselves and to spread
mayhem
across the middle east and far beyond
we cannot allow the world's leading
sponsor of terrorism
to possess the planet's most dangerous
weapons
we ask all nations to isolate iran's
regime
as long as its aggression continues
and we ask all nations to support iran's
people
as they struggle to reclaim their
religious
and righteous destiny just hours after
trump's speech national security adviser
john bolton issued a dire warning to
iran
according to the muellers in tehran we
are the great satan
lord of the underworld master of the
raging inferno
so i might imagine they would take me
seriously that i i
when i assure them today that if you
cross
us our allies or our partners
you harm our citizens if you continue to
lie
cheat and deceive yes there will indeed
be
hell to pay the murderous regime and its
supporters
will face significant consequences if
they do not
change their behavior let my message
today
be very clear we are watching and we
will come after you
today president trump is set to chair a
meeting of the u.n security council on
nuclear proliferation
to talk more about trump's comments at
the united nations particularly on iran
we go to ann arbor michigan to speak
with juan cole professor of history
at the university of michigan his blog
is called inform consent
he's the author of many books um
informed comment rather he's the author
of many books including
engaging the muslim world his
forthcoming book muhammad prophet of
peace
amid the clash of empires it's out in
october
we welcome you back to democracy now
professor cole let's start where
president trump started his speech let's
start
with the laughter of the world leaders
when trump
talked about boasted about his
accomplishments of the last two years
well this was a hall full of world
leaders who'd actually
run administrations and they've seen the
uh uh the chaos
of the of the trump administration for
the past two years and uh
i i think what's amazing is not that
this hall of
seasoned uh professionals laughed at him
but that he doesn't get more laughter in
the united states
these cable news programs take him
seriously they've normalized him
he's he's told thousands of lies and his
his rate of lying has increased
enormously in recent
months and i think it he should be
laughed off the screen everywhere
oh well professor cole i want to ask you
while the president was giving the
speech this same
week there was a a key announcement
which i think has not gotten a whole lot
of publicity that the governments of
of the united kingdom germany france
china
and russia have all uh supported an idea
to
basically break away from the sanctions
that
uh that president trump has uh has uh
put on iran
and to create some kind of a special
purpose vehicle a financial bank
in europe that would allow companies to
do
uh uh to uh conduct trade with iran and
not be
able to suffer from sanctions i'm
wondering if you could comment about
the importance of this sort of
declaration of financial independence by
these major world powers
well i think in some ways one it's it's
the um
one of the more significant uh
developments in the relationship the
united states uh to europe since since
the end of world war
ii uh europe has most often
taken its lead from the united states on
world affairs
and here it is directly defying
washington's will
the u.s department of the treasury is
the instrument used
by administrations to impose sanctions
and those sanctions can be imposed uh on
trade that
is conducted in dollars uh or uh through
u.s
banks and so what the europeans are
saying is we'll set
up a vehicle for iran to do business
with us
with with european firms which will be
in euros
and it will sidestep u.s banks
and and international exchanges so as to
ensure that some of the economic relief
that was promised to iran for
mothballing
most of its civilian nuclear
enrichment research would come through
i wanted to go back to iranian president
rouhani
speaking at the united nations general
assembly suggesting the u.s
under trump has adopted a nazi
disposition he didn't
mention trump by name
it is unfortunate that we are witnessing
rulers in the world
who think they can secure their
interests better
or at least in the short term right
public sentiments and gain popular
support
through the fomenting of extremists
nationalism and racism
and through xenophobic tendencies
resembling a nazi disposition
as well as through the trampling of
global rules and undermining
international institutions
it is ironic that the us government does
not even conceal
its plan for overthrowing
the same government it invites to talks
so that was president rouhani your
response one call
well you know i'm a critic of the human
rights
conditions under this regime in iran
but you have to admit that that rouhani
has a point
trump has made white nationalism a
key element an open element
of american policy both foreign policy
and domestic
trump has spoken
dismissively of many of the countries in
the world
that are struggling to develop as poor
and he has implemented uh uh policies in
the united states that clearly are
race-based uh and and
and has spoken dismissively of
minorities
and one of the reasons uh back in the
60s that
the u.s government was so nervous about
the civil rights movement was that they
were afraid
u.s enemies of the u.s especially the
communists would take
advantage of the fact of jim crow
and of the racist regime in the united
states
to turn the world against the country
and i think we're at a juncture where
this this threat is there again that is
to say
much of the world is in the category
that
trump looks down on and iran
has has had a kind of third worldest
foreign policy
and it's going to use this to
to do politics on the global scale
against the united states
and professor cole i wanted to ask you
while he was dismissive as you mentioned
of many
countries including some u.s allies he
declared sort of a pantheon of nations
that he believed were making progress in
the world
which included saudi arabia which
at last time i looked was a a complete
absolute monarchy
uh the uh po uh poland which is the most
right-wing government arguably in europe
today
uh and israel i'm wondering about his
selection of countries
uh that people should look to for
inspiration
sure well you know all of the countries
you mentioned have severe human rights
problems uh and and i think poland is
just on the
cusp of of being sanctioned in the way
that that hungary has been
for departing from european human rights
norms
and judiciary norms saudi arabia as you
say is is an absolute monarchy
and despite some cosmetic recent reforms
they they do things like sentence
bloggers to a thousand lashes
for criticizing the government even some
of the women
who had led the the charge on getting
the right to
drive uh have now been arrested now that
it's a government uh achievement and and
they're being denied the credit
and they're in jail uh so yes i mean
trump
exalts these right-wing tendencies
poland has a very strong anti-immigrant
uh
policy which is part of what trump
admires about them
uh and it all is you know if it's not
nazism it's it's certainly racial
superiority of
of uh how what trump would
you know categorize as white people
early tuesday morning president trump
tweeted despite requests
i have no plans to meet iranian
president hassan rouhani
maybe someday in the future i'm sure
he's an absolutely lovely man
well later tuesday in an interview with
cnn's christian amanpour rouhani
denied iran had requested a meeting with
trump
not this year nor last year we have
never made such a request
for a meeting with the president of the
united states
of course last year
from american officials we received
eight
requests for a meeting
and i did not see that as being an
appropriate meeting
as i do not see it as being appropriate
now
and a meeting must take place at a time
when that meeting can serve a purpose
can be beneficial
can serve the benefits of both countries
but under the current conditions
i when it comes to a meeting and
dialogue
i do not see it as beneficial nor
appropriate but you should ask him who
made such requests so here is trump
saying that despite you know iran's
repeated requests and president rouhani
is saying we made no such request this
year or last year
but talk about the significance of this
one cole as president trump
declares he's going to have a second
summit um with north korea
um his relationship with rouhani and
what this means
for even places like syria
well it shows the dangers of having
somebody who's frankly unbalanced as the
president of the united states
i mean he lies he's a pathological liar
everything that comes out of his mouth
is a lie
uh and and to have somebody at the at
the helm of the country
uh who who consistently tells these
falsehoods
is embarrassing uh it's very obvious
that the iranians don't want to meet
with him and never have wanted to meet
with him
because they had spent all of 2014 and
2015 negotiating
this uh nuclear deal and they finally
had a breakthrough they had
a international agreement it's a deal
not with the united states but with the
u.n security council
uh plus uh the european union
represented by germany
uh and and trump violated that treaty
he he withdrew from it and uh has put
the united states on in a war footing
with iran to the extent that members of
his administration are openly admitting
that they are the great satan we always
took that as an insult john bolton seems
to
to enjoy the epithet uh
so of course the iranians don't want to
meet with trump
and what good would it do to to to does
he want to renegotiate the the
the deal that this already has taken uh
uh
years and years of diplomacy uh and
trump just withdrew with
from it and why wouldn't they expect him
to withdraw from the next deal
so you know if you have to make a
judgment
who's right here it's it's it's
obviously rouhani but the other thing to
say
is that it's dangerous to have somebody
who who lies like this
in charge of the united states we're
we're a super power we're a nuclear
power we're doing diplomacy
we have relationship with other
countries this can go to war
