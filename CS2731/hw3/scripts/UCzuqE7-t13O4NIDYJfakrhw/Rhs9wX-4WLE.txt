the war and peace report i'm amy goodman
with juan gonzalez
we're spending the hour looking at a new
york times investigation that reveals
many of the american-led air strikes
against islamic state militants actually
killed civilians
one of the survivors the reporters
interviewed by simrazo
described a coalition airstrike on his
home in mosul iraq in 2015
in which his wife daughter brother and
nephew
were killed video of the strike on his
home shows a target hit with military
precision
bossa marazzo is just joining us and
you've heard a part of his story in our
last
segment as he speaks to us from erbil
iraq
via democracy now video stream and we're
joined in our new york studio by the two
reporters who
co-authored the new york times
investigation headlined
the uncounted it was the cover story of
the new york times magazine this past
sunday
azmat khan investigative journalist and
a future of war fellow at new america
and arizona state university and anan
gopal assistant research professor at
arizona state university and the author
of the book
no good men among the living azmat khan
talk about the u.s figures for how many
civilians have died how many air strikes
how many civilians
killed and then what you found
so the coalition which is led by the
united states releases monthly civilian
casualty figures
our analysis of them shows that they
have admitted to 466
iraqi civilian deaths in 89 airstrikes
this is of more than 14 000 that they've
carried out in iraq
which is an incident rate of 0.6 percent
less than one percent
well less than one percent so that's
been one percent exactly
point six percent what we found is that
one in five airstrikes or 31 times
as high resulted in civilian death
and your analysis is based not obviously
on all the 14
000 but you investigated about 103
separate incidents because 14 000 over
roughly a four year period we're talking
about
a hundred air strikes a day on average
that were occurring in iraq
uh in this war against isis yeah many of
these air strikes took place
at near or at around the time of
liberation but they were ongoing
throughout and so we saw an
escalation around the time that mosul or
parts of mosul were retaken
but you're basically looking at our
sample which was
in east mosul it was in a in a
neighborhood called aden
a town that's so in east mosul is
relatively an urban
densely packed neighborhood next we had
like a suburban
municipality called kyara and after that
we had
downtown shora which is probably a small
settlement
typical of many isis-held areas and in
each of these
103 strikes you actually went on the
ground to interview
people who were there at the time to
find out what happened
exactly so i've been to the site of
every single one we interviewed hundreds
of survivors
we excavated the rubble we looked for
any presence of isis whether that was
in isis propaganda materials weaponry
we analyze bomb fragments we analyze
satellite imagery before and after in
order to assess
the date ranges of when these air
strikes had happened we also checked all
of the civilian casualty allegations
with local administrators health
officials or
law enforcement an ongoing paul
how does the u.s military gather its
numbers
well most of these numbers come from
internal reports by the u.s military
itself for example if
they notice emission irregularity if for
let's say a pilot is dropping a bomb and
all of a sudden
a civilian vehicle appears after the
bomb is dropped they'll report that to
their superiors
and and oftentimes they'll investigate
that
occasionally they get reports from
outside sources from the media from air
wars which is a great organization that
tracks these things
but they tend more often than not to
actually discount those reports
and it's their own internal reports that
they take the most seriously
which is why the number is so low 466
civilians killed
and 14 000 airstrikes would if that was
true it would make it the most precise
air war in the history of humanity
um but it's because the threshold for
what qualifies as evidence for
being a civilian is extremely extremely
high so in practice
people like bossam are in fact guilty
until proven innocent
so is bosom included in this count of
civilians
even the far lower count that the u.s
military has
well initially he wasn't and a large
part of our investigation was to
to press that point um his his family
members were not counted
um they were listed as isis basically
um after the airstrike in his house uh
the coalition put up a video of the
strike
claiming that it was a ied factory a car
bomb factory essentially
and so you could you could have gone on
youtube and found the the video of the
bombing that destroyed his family
for over a year and it was only after we
found this
and and sort of showed this to the
coalition that they kind of took it off
youtube
and eventually after a long process of
hundreds of emails and back and forth
did they admit that they killed his
family and that they were civilians and
they were eventually added to the
council today they're part of the count
but they have hadn't been for many years
now this this
issue of the preciseness of these
strikes which the military is always
touting that
they hit exactly what they're looking
for your report suggests that the
problem is
not so much in the munitions themselves
but in the intelligence of what are the
targets that they actually
strike that is faulty intelligence could
you talk about that well that's right
and in fact
uh talking about precision in some ways
is a sleight of hand because
in fact it's true they are very precise
they hit exactly what they intend to hit
the question is what do they think
they're hitting and the intelligence
is often so poor and again it goes back
to this issue of iraqis having to prove
that they're not
isis which is uh the opposite of what we
would think we'd think that they would
they would do the work the coalition
would do the work to find out whether
somebody is a member of isis or not
essentially they assume people are isis
until proven otherwise and that's what
leads to this extremely high count boss
morazzo
i wanted to go back to you now you're in
erbil
your home is in mosul you went to
western michigan university in michigan
here in the united states
yes i was at western michigan i
graduated in 1988
in a degree with industrial engineering
bsc
and you traveled with your wife in a
sort of love journey across the country
yeah that was in 1982 when she joined me
and we went for like a honeymoon
for about 40 days around the united
states in my car
so you moved home to mosul
um your family was killed in 2015.
and what has been your interaction with
the u.s military
well first when i was in turkey for my
operation i received a
text on my viper from the american
embassy in baghdad
saying that they would like to contact
me and
i take them back i told them i was in
turkey and i will
get in touch with them as soon as i i'm
backing back that
i returned late
about december and then i texted them
and then they they gave me
an appointment to meet with them in
february that's when i visited the
american concert in baghdad and i had
gathered
some report i wrote down the report i
gathered some
uh pictures uh some aerial shots of my
farm
and then i went to the embassy i
[Music]
submitted the report to them
and the woman who interviewed me she
told me that they would have to make
sure that my allegations were right
and that they will pass my information
to the dod
for verification and then i never heard
from them for like two months
i emailed them back and the lady said
we still have not heard anything from
them and
nothing four months until about like
five
six months later i emailed them a letter
and
it was returned uh with the saying the
mailbox is full that's when i started
doubting that there was something is
going on
and then that's when i really met azmets
and then things started rolling from
there
the reporter who did this amazing piece
along with anan gopal for the new york
times so
um can you describe your meeting when
you
went to the what u.s embassy in
was it baghdad and tell us what you were
demanding and what it was that they
gave you okay when i submitted my report
she looked at it and then she took it
she went inside into a room and she came
back like 15
minutes later uh i had the ma
in my report i had demanded that first
and most important thing to me
was for them to state clearly that this
bombing
is a mistake this is just to clear my
name and
so i can no longer be afraid to go back
to mosul
because at that time i was labeled as
isis
my second demand was for them to
compensate me
uh for the losses of my family
i demanded compensation for my
injury i had lost my job because of my
injury
so this was basically my demands in my
uh
reports that i submitted and what was
their response
uh well it took them months and months
to
if it wasn't for azmets pushing
and then they they offered me
first they admitted that the bombing was
done by mistake but this took
months and months of emails back and
forth they still have not
provided me with a clear letter saying
that the bombing was done by mistake
and then uh they gave me an appointment
to meet in erbil to offer me a payment
they called solacia payment
when i met with them at urbill airport
this lady lawyer she she expressed
her sorrow and deepest sympathy to my
accident
and she said we are sorry we know the
bombing was done by mistake and i
for the second time and third time i
asked her i said listen
i need an explicit letter from you
saying that the bombing then
was done by mistake she said okay i
promise i will get you this letter
and then they offered me the payment of
fifteen thousand dollars
as a compensation for the death of my
wife
and my daughter which i immediately
declined
and she said i'm sorry sir this is the
most that we can do and we're tapped off
uh and then i asked her for one more
request my farm has been ransacked
by government officials i
cannot cannot say who because there were
so many
uh government agencies that entered
muslim liberated mosul being the
the army the federal units the
hashed i don't know but they entered my
farm and they have ransacked it
and they have stolen so many things and
i said listen lady i need
you to help me get award to the
whoever is in charge of that area that
stop anybody from entering the premises
and she also promised that she will get
in touch
through the american forces with the
local commanders to stop anybody from
entering
but this has not happened actually till
about
uh three weeks ago they have entered the
premises again
and they have stolen more material from
a storage that we have
so they have not offered me anything
till now
i wanted to ask osman khan this is a
family that's a professional family
well-educated was relatively middle
class and
uh there are many others uh who are
victims
who are not so fortunate and that don't
have the ability to really confront the
the the coalition uh you you talk about
one case in april
of 2015 where 18 civilians were killed
and where the coalition is still saying
there's insufficient evidence
that any uh that any civilians were
killed in that attack
what is happening with all these other
cases right that that particular
incident was an electrical substation in
east mosul
for which there was ample evidence of
online when i went on the ground and
interviewed people dozens of people they
said just go online you'll find the
videos and i did
they showed children who were maimed and
hurt some of their legs were blown off
these these young young children boys
and girls
there's no doubt about whether or not
they are civilians and so this was
readily available to the coalition
but in the coalition's own assessment of
this incident they concluded there was
insufficient evidence
um now to speak to this excellent point
about
how so many survivors that that i've met
really don't have the resources or
access or networks in the way that
bossim did
to for example arrange an appointment at
the u.s embassy in baghdad
what i found repeatedly were people who
couldn't even afford to rebuild their
homes some people who couldn't afford
to even seek necessary medical treatment
one family in mosul had three injured
they lost eight
eight individuals in an airstrike in
last november
in east mosul and what they told me
was that we're still injured and the
women you know they took me to a room in
the back
and one woman revealed her head scarf
and pulled open a cap and you could
actually see the skull
on her you could see the skull visible
from the top
um another woman her she had no medical
treatments
she had no medical treatment she they
needed really expensive surgeries and
when
you know ultimately what we did is we
provided all of the coordinates
of these air strikes to both the
coalition and to the u.s air force after
we had visited the base
in qatar where many of these aircraft
take off from
what they told us in the case of for
example the the incident i just
described to you with these with these
injured women who could not afford
medical treatment was that in that case
they had conducted an airstrike just
meters away on that day so this is very
likely a coalition airstrike and these
individuals
who often don't even have cell phone
cell phones that are working all the
time have
very little means and access and we've
now turned over
all of those allegations that were close
to where
the coalition reported coordinates to us
and
we're waiting to hear a response to them
about whether or not they're even going
to investigate them
and asmr when you went uh when boss when
bassam went to
uh the u.s um lawyer
and he laid out you know all he'd lost
this is outside of the
agony of the loss of his family his wife
his daughter his nephew deeply close to
him and his brother next door
um talked about what the houses are
worth he owns a downtown building and
mosul
said something like five hundred
thousand dollars um
and then they said altogether 15 000
if they sign if he signs on the dotted
line
how common is this and i mean he's
talking about even this
wouldn't have happened though he's not
gotten a letter that is not part of isis
even if they say it to him privately
how typical is this so this is one of
two
condolence payment offers that have made
have been offered in this entire
anti-isis air war so since august 2014
and some
27 000 airstrikes in both iraq and syria
this is one of two offers this is the
only offer that was made for a civilian
death the other offer that was made was
for
uh damage to a car in a separate
airstrike but not for a civil and so
boston how much has been allocated
so every year for the last two years
congress has authorized
five million dollars in funds to be used
for payments like these
there have only been two offers made
bostom is the only offer for a civilian
death that has been made during that
time and in this case the 15 000 just to
give you a sense it was for his wife and
daughter only
that is even higher than what they
ordinarily offer which is usually capped
at 2 500 per death
that have something to do with you being
there actually boston
i'm sorry excuse me was actually in the
meeting with them
anan describe that meeting and your
participation in it
