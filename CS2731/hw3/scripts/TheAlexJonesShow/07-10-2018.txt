big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios it's Alex Jones
breaking news alert almost no coverage of this even though it came out an hour
ago in the Chicago Tribune Trump pardons ranchers the Hammons in case that
inspired 2016 occupation of national wildlife refuge in Oregon amazing
Trump's also set to go to England where the Islamists mayor city con is
openly been calling for Trump to be blocked from the country simply simply
amazing meanwhile with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh we witness ABC news and
others calling him a extreme candidate calling the controversial a candidate
before his name had even been announced women's March also has been mocked for
calling Supreme Court nominee xx and extremist in pre-written statement so
they just said whoever it was that extreme quite frankly if anything
Kavanaugh is a mainline Bush I type conservative who Trump sees as safe to
get in and I trust the president so much and he hasn't proven it's wrong yet
that even though I don't like the connection to Carl Rove I don't like
the connection to never Trumpers the man does have a pretty good
conservative voting record as a jurist and getting to see him up on the stage
last night so you seem pretty genuine and he and Trump seem to have good
chemistry and that's a lot of what Trump works with as well so we'll see
what happens Barrett I think would have been better for so many reasons more
conservative more Christian that at least interactions demonized for that and
you've got Feinstein saying the dogma of Christianity is strong in you
I'm excited strong with you so channeling Yoda it's an amazing time to be alive
obviously we're gonna be looking at the Hammond case for those that forget
there's a thing called controlled burns and everybody does it from upstate New
York to Georgia to Florida to New Mexico to Texas to Illinois to Oregon and the
Forest Service under Obama started saying you got to get permits for those
and then they wouldn't issue them and so these brothers did some controlled
burns right on their property line as a fire break because the Park Service is
famous for not clearing that out now and then there's a fire it builds up
super heat and comes on your land and a little bit of it like a half acre or
something in the control burn burn some forest bottom area burn some grass and
they put them in prison for it and called it arson so anybody that's lived in
Texas you know every year after the summer's over the Mexicans burn their
fields to put nitrogen back into it it's whatever it's cultures done for
thousands of years and there's a lot of smoke in the sky sometimes it makes you
cough sometimes you know the makes the sun sets incredibly beautiful are we
gonna arrest all the Mexicans for doing it it's what you do but beyond that it's
a firebreak so Trump is pardon ranchers who arrest led to armed occupation of
wildlife refuge he is not pardoned the Bundy's yet but they've been winning
their court cases but have been through living hell now obviously got set up by
some informants and others but that has just been a real nightmare and we saw
journalists like Pete Santelli you I don't think broken he lost being thrown
in prison for years and then finally being able to get out it's it's it's been
a bad situation and then to have paramilitary there with the FBI shoot an
unarmed man mr. Finnegan it's it's been quite the devilish fiasco and could have
sparked a new wayco type siege but thank God that got de-escalated and Trump's
trying to get the Forest Service and the Park Service the BLM really as we're
talking about stop acting like Soviet thugs so that's all coming up today plus
the big bricks at fight heating up a Theresa May tries to betray the voters
of the UK it is a big broadcast info wars dot com news wars dot com tomorrow's

ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide I am your host
Alex Jones and Trump has just hardened the Hammond brothers the foresters and
cattle ranchers in Oregon who did a controlled legal and lawful burn right
along their property line with the US Forest Service quote property and
because a small amount of land burned a little bit of grass and undercover a
foliage under the trees they were sentenced to a long prison sentence
sparking the outrage and the standoff that then develop I think it's a very
very good move you could argue that a pardon of the bundies would only spark
more people to have armed confrontations but you cannot argue that this was a
very good pardon that said I think the bindi should be pardoned because the
feds came and took their land they took their cattle to starve them to death and
then live the media and says it wasn't their land because the public didn't
understand surface rights versus who has the actual title to it but when you're
there since 1877 and you have the grazing rights those are the rights and you
just can't take them there were hundreds of families there now there is one
family there we don't need more people run off the land in this UN
rewilding program of UNESCO George Herbert Walker Bush in 1992 shine us
on to that thing put our schools our immigration program our land use
everything under the UN and people would say oh the crazy conspiracy theorist
they say we're under the UN because we were remember what Trump did last year
he said the UN no longer runs our refugee program we're gonna decide who
comes in via ice and via the Constitution I'm retaking recapturing
the power the president has under the Constitution and of course the Supreme
Court unanimously years later said it was right because the president has that
power it's in the Constitution a five-year-old could read that understand
it how had it been transferred to the UN the UN would say who can come in the
UN would vet the people of course they weren't vetting them who runs the
refugee program in Europe the UN if a international unelected body can tell
you who you take in and how your borders are operating you are under global
government and they will use those third world populations as weapons so I
bring that up to remind folks that the UN with the EU as we speak is telling
Europe that they are bringing in the United Nations the EU is bringing in
the United Nations to establish quote refugee centers those are invasion
centers and the EU is now creating a Navy to block Italy from blocking George
Soros chartered ships coming out of Africa daily with thousands well guess
what that just made Italy start to vote to leave the EU oh but here's the
problem there's a permanent bureaucracy and just as Italy never voted to enter
the unelected EU and just as the UK never voted to do it even though they
voted for Brexit two years ago Theresa May and that's coming up upon what Joseph
Watson report at the bottom of the hour tried to sign a deal unilaterally
putting them back in the EU but see people say well if we vote to leave or
we vote to get out of these criminal programs why they just keep coming back
but then people are awake and a set of denying we're under the UN and denying
we're under world government when you get a real president or you get a real
party like UKIP and you get real movements in Europe pointing out that
no one ever voted to enter this and the EU bureaucracy is permanent and the
parliament is ceremonial and then the the EU bureaucrats all hundred and
something thousand of them voted to give themselves diplomatic immunity a
decade ago and tax exemption from the EU wide raft of taxes like VAT and others
I mean you can't float that and get away with it what have I said thousands of
times if you expose the authoritarian nature of the global government EU UN
IMF World Bank global combine set up by the Rockefellers is 70 years ago if you
look at it it's totally flagrantly illegal it's flagrantly tyrannical it's
just naked it's prima facie on its face it is total corporate world
government by stealth and you ask well how do we defeat that because they've
got all the money they swindled it all of course and every tech owner like
Bezos and all of them cook all of them worth hundreds of billions of piece
control trillions are the most ruthless monsters with slave factories and forced
abortions and the daycare at Foxconn in China if people chain their kids up and
they crap on the street I'm not kidding look it up no environmental standards
no nothing and then they put more standards on us than anybody else so
that we can't operate and Trump's like we're not doing this anymore and here's
the other breaking news the Hill is reporting lawmakers target Chinese
security companies over spy fears Congress is now investigating the fact
that most major Chinese companies are run by members of Chinese intelligence
that our major universities have been openly been taken over by them that
they've done the office of personal management hack that Obama gave them all
the codes the realization that we've been totally infiltrated by the red
Chinese military and that they brag about it and that they have put bases all
over the world under the guise of factories and mines and that they are
intending to cut the US off economically and militarily and that our own so-called
elites 100% took China from what they didn't have running water in 99% of the
country and people wipe their air ends with their hands and let Mao kill 80
something million people to get them in line take them in line them up the
slaves and then total Western investment to leverage out the planet
China was wood-burning stoves in no toilet paper 60 years ago now it's got
more roads more industry than the United States has we have been totally
ripped screwed over absolutely militarily through economics destroyed
look at the headline right here it's on drudgerport.com it's also up on
info wars.com and it deals with new record trade deficit with China
Trump is just trying to put a tourniquet on our leg that's been chopped off at
the knee for 50 years the blood's been spraying out and finally was just kind
of barely coming out really almost a need for a tourniquet except we're
doing blood transfusions right now that's what Trump's doing he's got the
country off-life support blood transfusions trying to get us to eat our
first meal trying to get some color back in our skin and trying to get us up
and positive and realizing we're in a fight because they use our open free
society traders in our own government multinational banks to bring the United
States down at the end of World War two they said the US dominates the planet
it's got half the wealth it's got everything it's promoting freedom
worldwide we can't have that let's promote a form of corporate communism and
let's prop China up in a big master plan to do it and so all of you anti for
people already are Maoist go to their meetings they know it all you Democrats

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
you keep saying you've got something for me
something you call love but confessed you've been a messing where you
shouldn't have been a messing and now someone else is getting all your best
these boots are made for walking and that's just what they do one of these
days these boots are gonna walk all over you and the old establishment left is
crapping their bridges right now they don't know what to do America you keep
lying when you ought to be true and the West is fighting for its life and you
keep losing when you ought to not bet and we're starting to win you keep
saying when you ought to be a change in it's right you ought to be changing now
what's right is right but you ain't been right yet but they're not changing and
they haven't been right yet where does communism or socialism work
nowhere except for a tiny one-tenth to one percent that always gets total
power so I'm gonna just keep on walking with the truth with history on my side
all over you tyrants get used to it
they prime example of that which is some really good unintentional humor
Pelosi dims must win midterms to preserve civilization as everyone runs
from blue cities and blue states all over the world I know it's a red blue
dichotomy the media came up with decades ago for their map boards during
elections but you look globally and call it's kind of upside down world but call
free market countries red and socialist or communist countries blue even though
communist colors red everyone's running from the blue towards the red aren't
they but then the left always tells you they are civilization there's always
propaganda about spaceships and science and everything but they can't do any
thing they can't get their act together and as the economy comes roaring back
they now admit they're trying to sabotage it to stop Trump so I'm gonna go
over some of the amazing economic numbers here in just a moment but also
look at the poison lining to this if we don't long term and even the midterm
fix things but this is Trump walking all over them with Brett Kavanaugh here he
is making the announcement last night tonight it is my honor and privilege to
announce that I will nominate judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States
judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials unsurpassed qualifications
and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law the Supreme Court is
entrusted with the safeguard of the crown jewel of our republic the
Constitution of the United States the rule of law is our nation's proud heritage
it is the cornerstone of our freedom it is what guarantees equal justice and the
Senate now has the chance to protect this glorious heritage by sending judge
Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court people are asking me what
I think of this I'm usually right and a lot of insiders thought that Kavanaugh
was out because of Rand Paul because the Bush connections but his voting
records actually pretty conservative and Trump likes him and Trump knows other
people that know him and he is well suited to probably win confirmation the
problem is and I'm gonna get into this right now the Democrats have announced
their plan it hasn't gotten a lot of traction yet but they've announced their
plan to try to block him and their argument is we're gonna block everybody
because Trump is under investigation and so therefore it's a conflict of
interest if he puts the Supreme Court justice in who might then sit over
judgment of him well by that extension he couldn't have the last guy either if
you know about separation of powers that's how you balance this out then
oh the president does get his Supreme Court nominees he does get to pick them
he does get to put them forward and then when they get in they will sit in
judgment that's how it works you just can't have the legislative over the
executive or the executive of the legislative or the judicial over it's
it's separate but equal class and it's very very clear but now they're playing
this game Politico has an article out what Trump's Supreme Court pick means
for the Russia probe and you've got these different congressmen different
senators like Corey Booker saying President Trump is currently a subject
of an ongoing criminal investigation and any nomination of a Supreme Court
justice all investigation continues is unacceptable because of the clear
conflicts you just can't have anybody now see trying to sell that idea of
interest inherent the president installing someone installing someone
no no they are approved by Congress who could be deciding vote on the number
of potential issues for the investigation that could come before the court
senator Corey Booker said in a statement opposing Kavanaugh's nomination now
where's the inherent fraud there because it's the Supreme Court justice is
appointed by Democrats that sit over Democrats that's how the separation of
powers works so one group doesn't get full control and overthrow the whole
system which is what the Democrats have been trying to do for decades and
globalism is a world system to overturn nation-states period they're the
traders that hate America they hate flyover country they hate the bitter
clingers they hate the second amendment they hate the Christians they've
declared their hatred of this country they've declared their hatred of this
country's economy they are the clear and present danger they're the enemy and if
anything Kavanaugh's association with the Republican establishment means he
might not be trustworthy for Trump but Trump has done nothing he's our
president he could go sign any deal he wanted with Russia because he's the
president then if Congress thought it was bad and thought it had political
support of the people they could impeach him for it but he can do whatever he
wants there's no prior restraint that's that's why put the president in is very
important and a sacred duty when you're the big global empire but see the
globalists have had us build the empire and now they wanted to remove America
from the equation controlling the empire so Trump's gonna meet Theresa May
coming up here in just a few days that's gonna be a circus he's been meeting
with Putin and Trump has found his sea legs he's winning on every front and the
globalists are panicking and don't know what to do and it's a beautiful time to
be alive right now but when we come back I'm gonna play some more of these
clips I've got Paul Watson's report on the attempts to keep the UK in the EU
with no vote in fact countermanding another vote but what I'm saying about
Trump is this the will of the people are behind him and so when he made the
joke I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and my supporters and will still
support me he gets the fact that he's gonna deliver to us we're gonna deliver
to him and that's why I'm so behind the president because we're taking the
country in the world back and the globalists are crapping their pants and
things are turning around so praise God's all I got to say that mean things
are perfect but in my gut I know Trump's good as well

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
lines of the info war here's why I'm so pro Trump here's why I endorsed him for
president early on if I can smell fate I can see future paths that I want to
follow that I want my family to be part of that's what a leader is now the
globalist hate Trump they hate nationalist movements they hate free
market because they've already gotten control of the planet's wealth and they
don't want you to have any wealth because they want total power over you total
control and Trump has been deathly guiding this country back from the
brink and when you look at how the communist Chinese even in the Washington
Post they admit have taken over America's top 50 public schools with just
billions coming in and directly setting up endowments taking control and our
government stood by and let him do it because it was part of a master plan oh
here's the Panama Canal here's all the major deep water ports here's all our
missile secrets and then they put their army officers and their air force
officers and their Navy officers into the schools I've been doing it for decades
to be students and then they end up being the heads of the schools the heads
of the science programs and it's in the Hill newspaper today that Congress is
having hearings on this lawmakers target Chinese security companies over
spy fears we have been sold out this was the next world war this was the
global corporate war to bring down Europe bring down the E the the United
Kingdom using the EU this is the stealth program and it's admitted and it's
diabolical and it can say but it happened and so all of you that hate
Trump and hate America well you've never been to China you've never been to
Venezuela you've never studied it you have no idea what I'm even talking
about you just hate Trump because he's a Nazi because late night TV said so
500 times and what you've got is a bunch of spoiled rotten brainwashed
sniveling prindies who have this whole birthright right in front of them and
they want to just crap it away because in some feeble area of their mind they
think they're on this big international global intellectual team because
their high school teachers and their college professors patted them on the
head and said you're good look Hollywood and mainstream media and the
chai comms and the unelected EU and the islamicist mayors they all said oh
you're so smart let's launch a big fat Trump baby balloon and then have the
media report on it 10 million times and celebrate it in some stupid ritual when
that baby with the clothespin diaper on just beat your whole global system
rallying humanity and the West is coming back and that's all you've got to
offer that won't bother Trump he loves going to the correspondence dinner
before he got elected president having them call him a loser and saying you'll
never be president and you're a you're a piece of garbage because Trump knew he
who laughs last wins because he has an internal compass just like I do just like
our listeners do where we're not governed by peer pressure we're not
governed by the winds of propaganda we're governed by our inner rudder our
compass and it's what drives us what we know is right what we know is true
integrity and by the way with integrity comes incredible wealth incredible
success incredible power the problem is you ever experience family or neighbors
that don't really have a job and but boy they sure want to tell you how to run
your life they sure want to tell you what to do with your car they sure want to
tell you how you should live because they don't have a life they want to run
your life and they think calling us names lying about us pouring coffee on us
yelling and screaming at us does something yes it does something it lets
me know I'm right about how immature and stupid and thuggish and mob mentality
you people are and it means nothing to me what you do and what you say when I
was in Seattle they'd always run by and call me a Nazi or call me a name so to
wave them over and say tell me what you have to say tell me your intellectual
ideas and their answer would be to throw coffee on me and run away
and even when I offered the goblin as we call him $10,000 and first class
tickets to come here he wouldn't do it when we upped it to $20,000 it turns
out he is an out-of-work wannabe professional wrestler announcer it
turns out that the goblin cannot and will not debate and neither can his
Brian Stelter style teeth like he crossed Brian Stelter and Mr. Edd and
then threw in golem with a genetic chimera and then out popped this guy I'm
not trying to be mean it's just what is it about minions of this system that
make them so horrific to look at okay I gotta stop I really want to play this
Brexit report we come back to the next segment and we've got Mark Rondaza one
of the top first amendment lawyers in the country and he's gonna be in studio
with us we also have the gentleman who started the walk away movement who's
liberal and gay lives in New York who got thrown out of an electronic shop for
they said oh you're all right you're on Tucker Carlson get out of here I won't
sell you the microphone he's gonna be joining us and then Paul Watson and a
lot more Roger Stones be popping in he wants to and I want to get his take a
comment on the pardon of the Hammons who didn't engage in arson as the
BLM lied and said under Obama they did a controlled burn something that
everybody does who understands that you've got to have fire breaks and so
they call that arson and put them in prison for that so that is a big deal

volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found
here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water
and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to
unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water next we tested the water from our
Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe
measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the
filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is
that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
importantly a good water filtration system will purify it as the years go

you're listening to the alex jones show
well the minions of the establishment of the zombies that follow Hollywood
mainstream media I guess you call them the the suckers the weak-minded people
are physically attacking people running people out of stores rioting screaming
freaking out all over the country there's just so many reports of it I can't
even keep track of it a lot of it's up on infowars.com antifoshes beating up
anybody that's got a bumper sticker that's Christian on their cars other
there's so much of this pouring in there we've got three new videos of them
just beating up old women and let me tell you something I see like 15 young
punks beating up a 65 70 year old woman and I'm gonna be honest I just start
wanting to kill people I just as a man I can't watch that stuff because it
makes me angry at everybody around me I'm not trying to sound like a tough guy
either man how do you come up with grown men beating up old women I mean that's
why I cannot get around this stuff I just this country has produced so much
good but it's also produced a bunch of spoiled rotten scum that is the lowest
filth on the earth I mean I would just love to see each one of these punks
putting a ring with a patriot
just stop stop showing it to me that's just one of the videos I can't look at
it but I've seen it myself where they'll target an old dude on crutches or an old
lady on a wheelchair just like radical Islamists you see the videos where
they'll kick women downstairs and stuff it's it's just they are so dishonorable
they are so cowardly they are so weak that it's hard to believe that there is
scum like this and that it exists but it does exist and it is a creation a
dropping of the Nancy Pelosi's of Hillary of the San Francisco's of the
Seattle's of Austin much of Austin has fallen to it I've not evacuated but my
god it is a product of loathsome evil that must be met head on but I asked
men out there if you watch grown men run up and a woman beg them and say free
speech and they smack her in the face and the police do nothing of course
there's always these weird little potbellied Nelly police in San Francisco
a little you know that smile when they see it it's like what planet did you
come from because you don't act like people now we're going to Roger Stone
right now I'll get to the Paul Watson big Briggs it knows the start of the next
hour because I want to get into the the pardon and obviously what's behind
these things the president exercising executive power people haven't been doing
that except exercising it for the globalist now it's being an exercise
for America I love it but clever cutting him's written an article the
Palatano says Kavanaugh heart and soul of the establishment and then he's
disappointed and then it then that that that Justice Gourish was a good pick
and was honorable and I respect Andrew and Palatano and of course one of the
best friends of Roger Stone and I had one of the editors walk in and said do you
want to publish this and they normally let me ask me something about something
get sued for it and I might have lawyers review it but I said of course
publish it I like Clifford cutting him he works for us and I said I want to hear
what the Palatano has to say we're gonna show both sides we're not in a cult here
but here is my view and we'll go to Roger Stone if Trump can co-opt the
establishment then I'm all for it we want them to surrender and one way to do
that is to bring them in and then see if they'll be honorable if not you throw
him overboard that's what Trump does with the Supreme Court pick though this
guy will be there 30 40 years he's pretty young you can't do that and so
that's why it's a big deal so the left doesn't want him they're gonna oppose
anybody saying the president's under investigation so conflict of interest
totally unconstitutional to say that it's just made up but that's gonna be
their big push when they surround the Capitol and you know they're calling
for a civil insurrection but I know this I've seen the president so many times
come through that I trust him and I didn't want Kavanaugh Roger didn't want
him Senator Paul sitting was probably going to vote against him now he says
he's open which means there's been some behind-the-scenes discussion has
Kavanaugh pledged himself the Republic has he explained hey I just came up
through the system and Harvard and Yale okay I'm a white shoe boy but you know
I'll probably get confirmed and he's got a pretty good voting record he's got
some a few problems on civil liberties so that's my view is that the president
isn't God he can't do everything he knows a lot of things we don't know the
globalist absolutely hate him we need to get this confirmation before the mid
terms in case they steal those and they're gonna try to impeach the
president and they're gonna make a big move in the Supreme Court so I see what
the president is doing sometimes he's proven right sometimes he's proven
wrong most of the time he's proven right roger stone what do you think well I
agree with you Alex he was not my choice I'm not saying that he is not a
conservative he is but at the same time his deep ties to the establishment and
to the bush family were troubling to me whether or not his involvement as a
young prosecutor in the Vince Foster case the Clinton's lawyer who was you
know died in office comes up in his confirmations remains to be seen the
left would have opposed anybody Trump appointed they had their fill in the
blank signs already painted so they would have been just as by the way
there's actual video they had all the signs of all four potentials printed up
and that ABC News beforehand said controversial nominee before it was
even announced yeah so you know they were locked and loaded regardless of
where the president went let's see how this goes the left is also claiming that
the president wanted Kavanaugh because he thinks there's going to be a showdown
in the Supreme Court over the investigation by Robert Mueller and
whether or not the president can be subpoenaed to give a deposition perhaps
even broader issues I don't know that that's the case but that is the narrative
being spun by the left oh they're now saying he's not allowed to have any
nominees that that the previous one that he got in is bad I mean of course
it's not in the Constitution it's not true there's separate equal powers but
that is going to be their new push that Senator Booker and others are pushing is
that Trump just must be shut down his whole agenda because he's under
investigation by their little crackpot Mueller who's been totally exposed yeah
it's it's really kind of extraordinary clearly these people have never read the
US Constitution the president has the authority to make these appointments and
he should do so on an on a timely basis you can see that Ruth Bader Ginsburg is
holding on to see whether the Democrats win the Senate this November she's
hanging on by a thread so everything the Democrats say now is colored by their
growing hysteria over the popularity and success of the president the growing
economy really has them spooked because it gives the president the upper hand and
that was my next point and we'll cover it some we come back here in a few minutes
Pelosi dims must win midterms reserve civilization but everyone's running from
blue cities blue states and socialists in communist countries Texas the CNBC's
top state for business in America this year the coming labor shortage in
America is great for news for workers with wages rising rapidly without the
communist minimum wage which bankrupts things lowest ever Hispanic
unemployment ignored by Univision Tullamundo and it just continues ladies
and gentlemen homeowners are sitting on a record amount of cash and not tapping
in show and it just continues ladies and gentlemen the only areas being hurt are
retailers and things because obviously we have a situation with Amazon and the
rest of it we're gonna go to break here in just a moment with Roger Stone and
come back and talk about that but we can't be too confident because they're
planning a lot of nastiness we'll talk about how they're planning to keep the
president from getting this nominee through the approval process in the
Senate we'll also look at this latest pardon and why he did it but also the
larger strategy of why Trump is engaging in all of these part is early in his
presidency which really is unprecedented I think a great idea but
we'll explore all that don't forget today is the last day for the extended

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
you thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever but you rode
upon a steamer to the violence of the sun from the front lines of the
information war. It's Alex Jones
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is hanging by a thread after Brexit Secretary David
Davies and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned so why did they resign?
Because Theresa May brazenly betrayed Brexit by proposing a deal with the EU
that would de facto keep the UK in the customs union subjecting us to the same
regulatory and legal framework that we voted to leave and hampering us from
doing trade deals with other countries that would provide us with economic
independence and prosperity the very reason why we voted for Brexit in the
first place correct me if I'm wrong but when I went to vote in the referendum I
didn't see a third option that said leave sign up to everything under a
different name and be the EU's bitch to illustrate how this critical report is
coming up I just wanted to show you the start of it to again encourage everybody
to go to info wars calm to go to news wars calm and get the video and get it
out there because the fact that they're trying to ignore the vote of the people
of the UK to get out of the EU something that they never voted to do it to
begin with is illustrative of how authoritarian it is just like I'm trying
to overthrow our elected president that's the theme here because that's what
they're doing going back to Roger Stone Roger any other points on Kavanaugh
where you see this going and then let's shift gears into as I was just
mentioning the latest pardon yeah I just a final point on a Kavanaugh it's
instructed that Kavanaugh was a clerk for Justice Kennedy so it's conceivable
that one of the reasons they were able to get Kennedy to step down was because
he would be replaced by one of his clerks I would point out that justice
Neil Gorsuch was also a clerk to judge Kennedy now as a Supreme Court justice
even though he is retired Kennedy gets an office in the Supreme Court he gets to
hang around and he would have two of his former clerks on the court perhaps it
was sold to him that way the big news today Alex as you point out I was headed
to Las Vegas this weekend where I was scheduled to speak to a rally on Sunday
to free the Hammons the Hammons are embattled Oregon ranchers who ran a
file of the office of land management and were imprisoned for impossibly long
sentences they have now been pardoned by the president in a blockbuster move so
the rally that I was scheduled to speak to has been canceled happily this
demonstrates that the president understands how to use the pardon not
only to deliver justice for people who deserve deserve it Dwight Hammond is
79 years old Stephen Hammond is 49 the evidence against them at trial was
exceedingly weak the judge the Justice Department demanded a maximum five year
sentence for them was even clear that they were guilty of setting a fire that
they were accused of setting so the president also understands the symbolic
nature of these pardons for the West for the the the rugged individual West this
is a very clear sign that the president will stand up to the federal machinery
that's been grinding these ranchers and farmers you know under their boot for
many years I have been out West and you talk about jackboot dogs the way BLM
behaves to just the general public the way they glare at people at the trade
stations the way they act is very imperious very arrogant like like an
occupying army and they're for folks that don't know let's come back to do a
few more minutes on this is so critical some states like looking at Nevada are
90% federal there are several others that are 75 80% but most those Western
states are more than half federal and now they're always squeezing everybody
off the land working with the UN working with the Nature Conservancy working
with these groups and then they take people's farms and stuff and years
later rich guys come and build a mansion on it it is it is very Byzantine
it's very I would almost call it dark age what's going on and there is a war
by the corrupt federal government against the West and Trump has signaled an
end to that we'll be right back with Roger Stone straight ahead

you are listening to an info wars comm frontline report if you are receiving
this transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6
Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones Roger Stone was just
getting into the optics the iconography of President Trump this morning
announcing that he is pardoning two members the Hammond family who had done
some controlled burns before that are totally normal in your own land it was
another controlled burns goes on all over the country and they couldn't
prove it was them they tried to call it arson had a kangaroo group put him in
jail sparked a lot of outrage I mean you've got illegal aliens killing people
every day stabbing them and shooting them when they don't even go to jail or
you know killing an FBI agent did a $280 fine meanwhile oh a fire that hurts
nobody that burned some grass you're gonna go to jail for five years and then
it's almost sparked a huge uprising in the West recap what you were saying
about how they've been squeezing the West how under Obama and even Bush and
Clinton they've taken so much more land how they treat people on their own land
how they try to block roads so you can get to your land I mean there's a
rewilding going on under UNESCO on the treaty that George Herbert Walker Bush
signed well in the most egregious example of this of course was the Bundy
family of Nevada the claim that the Bundy's hadn't paid their their rent
in essence to the Fed to the government is false they attempted to pay their rent
to the county because they believed the land believed belong to the state not
the federal government the government's misconduct in the Bundy case was so
egregious was so outrageous that the judge threw the case out and then it was
announced last week that they will not be retried I flew out there for a rally
for a freedom for the Bundy's several months ago and the energy was quite
extraordinary so the Hammons are in a very similar situation sympathetic to
the Bundy's but the ranchers and the farmers of the West are tired of these
jackbooted thugs who work for them or the Bureau of Land Management where does
it say that they get their own police department their own para military
organization the the facts here were clear to the president he didn't have
to pardon the Bundy's all I think he would have in the end the judge
threw out those charges so a pardon became that unnecessary in this case he
has done the valiant and right thing by pardoning the Hammons and it just shows
what heroes the Bundy's and others have been and and David Knight was there in
the middle of it with our crew just just an amazing historic event and the
persecution they went through and the vindication by the judge there's
there's something new in the wind out there people are sick of producers being
harassed and targeted and treated like criminals and then criminals being held
up like their gods Roger Stone we were talking just we only have a minute left
for others Paul Watson report about the fact that the White House doesn't deny
report Trump made secret deal with Kennedy over retirement replacement well
that's think progress they just didn't respond to it but you know the whole point
is if if Kennedy's leaving and they end up putting his old law clerk in there
now that would that would make sense not illegal of how Trump makes deals to get
things done think progress is the single least reliable fake news site anywhere
on the internet anything they write is false they cannot be taken seriously in
any way my point earlier was one of simple speculation I don't know that
that happened but if it did it would not be illegal if the president told
Justice Kennedy that he would consider his former clerk Brett Kavanaugh who
everyone agrees is qualified that would not be in the slightest bit inappropriate
but Chuck Schumer is now openly saying Kavanaugh was point appointed to thwart
the Mueller investigation so there we have it you see the Democratic line of
the day well that's what I came out with this morning that's one of the
headlines is is that the Democrats have announced their plan to block all
judicial nominations basically the president if there's any chance that any
of the cases against him could ever be heard by any judge he puts in that's
just an sane idea it's the executive branch that's what it does it nominates
for the judiciary and then you have the legislative that then confirms so so
they're trying to break the the judicial legislative executive division of power
they are trying to basically block Trump's entire agenda with this new
theory everybody should point out well it's pretty cockamamie because the last
Supreme Court justice that Trump nominated got approved very very quickly
because he's highly respected by both sides and they didn't even raise that
point then so it just shows that they are grasping at straws but this is what
they're gonna use when Michael Moore surrounds the Capitol and when they get
their rioters out on the streets I think within just weeks are Roger let's talk
about that timeline weeks or months before the midterms certainly we're
gonna see them make their move for destabilization claiming oh he's about
to put a judge in on his own criminal case stop him stop him and use
legislative judicial executive ignorance in the Democratic constituencies
foolish little brains to create this this perception and really have them try
to move against the president but clearly that's the drum that Booker and
Schumer and all these people are pushing Alex you're absolutely right
look at also thinking it exposes their game plan for anybody who thinks that
Mueller is not coming after Trump in a bid to remove him is wrong and they
think this is going to end up in the Congress and in the courts and therefore
they're trying to get there first the president has a legitimate right to make
this appointment and the Senate will confirm him but it they've exposed their
longtime game plan despite the fact that mr. Mueller's probe continues to be
exposed as the partisan hit squad that it is has not lessened in any way his
intention to try to take out the duly elected president Donald Trump Roger
thank you so much for joining us we'll talk to you again very soon tonight on
the war room we expose the two British globalists who working with George
Soros have gotten a stranglehold on Americans America's digital electronic
voting machines today at the war room this is critical so much of the
information that ends up defeating the globalist originates on info wars that's
why the audience yes you are the vanguard you're not just listening to be
informed and again and also help us be informed and sending us tips and intel
you are the folks that are reaching out to others show that we can report on the
hardcore analysis then others pick it up later we end up being proven right and
it ends up changing the world so three o'clock central today the war room
Roger thank you great to be here speaking of Cory Booker let's play a clip of
that and then I'll come back with a Watson piece but it is important this is
just as important this is Cory Booker the senator and then we're gonna play a
Schumer as well it's just disgusting here it is I'm a little sort of stunned
at the way this is all played out if you look at the entire list of 20 or so
people that he had on the one person the president could find on that list that
would be most assured to rule in his favor should many of the things you're
describing come before the Supreme Court is this judge he picked the one guy who
was specifically written that a president in fact should not be the
subject of a criminal investigation which the president is right now so this
seems to be them of all the people the most self-serving person he could choose
in order to protect himself from this criminal investigation Booker thinks his
constituents are idiots which they are do you know how many judges and how many
Supreme Court justices have said that you can't have a criminal investigation of
the president originate out of the executive that's why you could never
get Bill Clinton you could only have Congress then move with impeachment then
once they're stripped then you can do that that's why nobody ever tried to
charge Richard Nixon he stepped down then they didn't go ahead with the
criminal charges but you cannot indict a sitting president and then have the case
go forward because then every two-bit county or city or anything could sit
there and bring down a president all day long just like Travis County the
Democrats are constantly indicting Rick Perry and Tom delaying everybody it's
unbelievable he thinks you're so stupid most of you know that heart disease is

to the alex jones show
resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
imagine being the globalist establishment and they think they can set
up a private above-the-law tax exempt corporate world government owned by a
bunch of rich white guys rich Arabs and rich Chinese people basically Chinese
communists and then they can sit there and everybody else race war with each
other and have the media all turn us against each other and then try to get
us to reject capitalism and accept socialism and communism that then they
administer multi-nationally we all live in a system of control where they tell
us where to go where to live what to eat Bloomberg says I want to tell people
what to eat I'm smarter than you I'm a technocrat in his own words Bloomberg
has articles about him about how he's this great technocrat and he's gonna
tell you how to live they are so blind by their arrogance and then you look at
Brexit that was the first big domino to fall now with over 50 countries going
towards capitalism becoming populist countries it's so exciting and you've
got the EU about to collapse you've got Brexit two years later May tried to sell
it out and keep them in the EU and that only makes people more angry and more
awake remember we pass Brexit folks go oh well they'll just ignore it and I said
that's even better because once people know they're getting screwed over they
get angry they get informed no one even knew that the EU I was covered the EU
20 years ago and people were saying oh the EU is not gonna take over the EU is
just a trade deal it's not gonna do anything there's no EU army there's no
and now it's all here so everything we talked about is mainstream now they
tried to demonize it they tried to make fun of it they tried to say it didn't
exist forever but now we can have a real debate we won they're bullying their
intimidation their attempt to say it's anti-semitic to say that the EU's corrupt
doesn't work or if you want free market you're racist people aren't stupid they
see through that except for the dumbest of the dumb who are being organized into
zombie armies it's gonna Paul Joseph Watson's powerful report on what Theresa
May has been caught doing just days before Trump travels to the UK UK
Prime Minister Theresa May is hanging by a thread after Brexit Secretary David
Davies and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned so why did they resign
because Theresa May brazenly betrayed Brexit by proposing a deal with the EU
that would de facto keep the UK in the customs union subjecting us to the same
regulatory and legal framework that we voted to leave and hampering us from
doing trade deals with other countries that would provide us with economic
independence and prosperity the very reason why we voted for Brexit in the
first place correct me if I'm wrong but when I went to vote in the referendum I
didn't see a third option that said leave sign up to everything under a
different name and be the EU's bitch to illustrate how much of a sellout this
was may ran the plan by Eurofiling Chief Angela Merkel before it was even
seen by her own party's MPs knowing it was a bad deal she preempted her own
ministers resigning on Friday by telling them they'd be quickly forgotten and
revoking access to their government vehicles and guess who praised the
plan Anna Subri Ken Clark and Vince Cable three of the biggest rim owners in
Parliament that tells you everything as we warned all along Brexit is being
betrayed Theresa May and her negotiators have cowed and rolled over to the EU
at every turn a prime negotiator is a remainder who in his Oxford days was a
Soviet fanboy who defended Stalin and implied communism was preferable to
capitalism at this point they're taking the piss so what happens next well
Boris and Davis have indicated that they resigned not to force Theresa May out
but to force her to revise her disastrous Brexit plan which given that
she's had two years to craft it and has delivered what Boris himself called a
giant turd sounds like a fall on hope it's time for Theresa to go it's time
to flush the turd 15% of conservative MPs or 48 of them to be precise have to
write a letter to the 1922 committee triggering a vote of confidence in
Theresa May if she loses then she's toast that will trigger a new leadership
contest which hopefully a committed Brexiteer will win the new leader will
then almost certainly feel a need to secure a mandate from the country by
calling a new general election he or she will then have to defeat Labour's Jeremy
Corbyn and save the UK from entering a hard left tyranny ruled by someone who
thinks Venezuela socialist dystopia is a good example to follow if Corbyn wins
he'll almost certainly derail Brexit or call for a second referendum if May
wins she'll deliver at best a soft Brexit which is a Brexit in name only
which is no Brexit at all so it's basically all or nothing we need a
leader who believes in Brexit for most people that man is Jacob Reese Mock but
JRM is a reluctant leader he's said numerous times he doesn't want to do
it could Reese Mock be kingmaker could it be time for Boris since the day after
Brexit I warned that the vote to leave was merely the start of the battle don't
expect the elite to take this lying down they'll just make us vote again in
another referendum until they get the result they want these people are
snakes don't think the battle is won it's only just beginning Theresa May is
surrounded by establishment globalists who share the very same attitude that
sold us out to the EU in the first place the very backstab that Margaret
Thatcher warned us about there's been no European Central Bank accountable to
no one least of all to national parliament
that kind of European Central Bank is no democracy taking powers away from every
single Parliament and being able to have a single currency and a monetary
policy and an interest rate which takes all political power away from us as my
right Honourable Friends said in his first speech after the proposal of a
single currency a single currency is about the politics of Europe it is about
a federal Europe by the back door they have no interest whatsoever in
delivering Brexit they have no loyalty to this sovereign nation so
Conservative MPs have a choice to make is your loyalty to Theresa May's dreadful
political legacy a legacy that has betrayed 17.4 million people and the
very notion of democracy itself a legacy that has led directly to the UK
soaring violent crime problem a legacy that has exacerbated the problem of
mass uncontrolled immigration a legacy that has eroded free speech and
emboldened cultures hostile to our own is your loyalty to that worth more than
your loyalty to your country is it worth more than your loyalty to the sanctity
of democracy is your legacy going to be about how you sold out to Brussels or
how at this pivotal moment in UK political history you stood up for Great
Britain

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
you
crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming
to you live from the front lines of the info war well Mark Rondizid writes a
piece for CNN you see him all over the news he's recognized as in the top three
first amendment lawyers out there and he represents me in the whole Sandy Hook
a defamation matter that we're not gonna really get into today but we're gonna
have 20 questions with him because he can cover the waterfront he calls himself
kind of a classical liberal on a mainline establishment liberal not a
right-winger but a classical liberal I kind of call myself that as well but
all the terms are turned around but I was asking him about Brett Kavanaugh his
view on him he's on a deep dive on him on some big issues you know his take on
Trump just pragmatically what Trump's doing and then the state of the craze
left and how he thinks we can counter but but it's a great to have you here
with us thanks Alex great to be here where do you want to start just on the
deep dive you did on the cabinet you know I first got some calls from the
press on what I thought of Kavanaugh when before he was the nominee just when
his name was being floated and my initial reaction was pretty bad because he
made a decision in a boss versus foreign policy group LLC out of the DC circuit
where he took the DC anti-slap law and said it didn't apply in federal court
that anti-slap laws had no place in federal court now as somebody who
employs anti-slap laws a lot for my defendants I mean I was instrumental in
getting the Nevada one passed that really struck me with a with a negative
cord so my reaction was this guy's going to be bad for free speech then when he
became the nominee I stayed up all night doing a dive into his first amendment
decisions and you know I've really kind of come around a bit I think he's I
think he's not going to be bad because in in that same a boss decision he made
a really good statement about reporters asking questions in a case cannot be
held liable for defamation because they're simply asking questions now you
can ask a question in a way that is quite obviously you're really just saying
something defamatory you know when did so-and-so stop having sex with goats you
know that's that's not of doesn't Brian's shelter look like somebody you
wouldn't have babysit your children I mean you could add yeah that's that you
could probably get away with but you know saying something something that's
clearly defamatory and throwing a question mark on the end of it is another
story but if you're doing anything that's reasonably close to journalism
you're going to be okay there's another decision that he made that I really
really liked where he called call versus Bureau of National Affairs where he
talked about how the First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press and
freedom of speech and how costly and time-consuming litigation can threaten
those freedoms so like when you have it which is exactly what the Democrats
admit they're doing in lawfare against Trump supporters right so when you do
that when you file a lawsuit look you you get a lawsuit filed against you you
come into my office I mean I immediately tell you you better kiss a lot of money
goodbye because defense is not cheap you know if you you want a more modestly
priced attorney we can send you to one but even then that's still expensive and
that is losing even more expensive losing is even more expensive but you
know when I when I was a very very young lawyer I got handed a defamation case
that I was defending all on my own against a very large law firm and I was
pretty proud of myself when I won and when I handed this this client the the
decision saying hey we won and he looks at me and says well if we won why is my
retirement fund empty and that really struck me and that's why I've been a
proponent of the anti of the slap provisions yeah because I despise
seeing someone go out there and exercise their First Amendment rights and then
somebody decides that they want to take a swipe at them just to punish them for
using those rights legitimately aren't you glad you chose the the Georgetown is
also saying me aren't you glad you chose the First Amendment because that was big
then but it's really big now Alex I didn't choose it it chose me you know
every every First Amendment lawyer that I know this is something that it chooses
them you know you when you're a kid every one of us has this story like that
we call it our quit hassling me man moment when we learn about our
constitutional rights and then I'd say within 24 hours of learning about them
you find that somebody's violating them and then you stand up for them and you
get slapped down again and you got to recognize that if you really want to
protect the First Amendment you really want to protect your constitutional
rights it's a constant fight it it's stressful it's it's pretty easy just to
let it go but there's some of us who won't do that you know I so I don't do
it because I chose it saying hey this is gonna be a great way to make you got
pushed around and so you stood up and you've had some some great success doing
it yeah so so long out back to the new nominee
Kavanaugh yeah you've got a lot of his decisions here I do I've got about six
pages of quotes from him and you know whether it comes for whether it's
commercial speech whether it's journalism I'm in general you know I'm
gonna give this guy a b-plus coming in and you know a couple days ago and you
know I admit I was probably a little bit overly overly negative about him
simply because of that one Abbas decision because you did the back of the
envelope quick analysis and now you've had a chance to look into it yeah I mean
I'd go crazy if I had done this kind of a all-night dive on everybody who was on
the shortlist because they'll cause knowing Trump they could have had five
or six people on that list and then all of a sudden he pulls somebody out of
left field but yeah when in really looking at this guy I am I'm optimistic
that his view on the First Amendment is gonna be good for the country well
that's a good thing because historically it's been the right wingers that have
been on the wrong side of it and so how does that juxtapose that the left I
would describe the left uniformly against the First Amendment uniformly
admitting in lawsuits against me which is flabbergasted you and many lawyers
we're not gonna get the cases themselves that they say we want to end the First
Amendment we want to overthrow it we want to shut it down for everybody but
us they're like they're they're launching what they've done at the
universities as a war outside with actual universities arguing for me to be
silent yeah look currently the the wind is blowing from the you know that the
cold wind is blowing from the left today those of us who actually believe in
the First Amendment that have stand stand on the same ground that we did
ten years ago and now we're all being called right wing you know back then I
was being called a libtard you know I don't really care one way or the other
I believe in this this is what I stand to fight yes right now I find the left
looking for exceptions trying to say you know I really didn't like Kagan's
language a few weeks ago about how the the conservative wing was weaponizing
the First Amendment you know that that frankly shouldn't be a pejorative the
First Amendment is a weapon it all and the left has gone way past with
everybody's a Nazi and they go past the First Amendment though they're calling
for violence they're calling for uprisings I mean they really passed
the Rubicon look I don't know that they have gone you know I'm a little less
pessimistic about it but yeah you know I remember when the you know the first
person said it was it's okay to punch a Nazi and then you know you like to
like hot coffee on you because you were talking I saw it in a bunch of news
articles when it came out you were representing me because a lot of other
lawyers we already had you to consult it we're gonna be having you involved but
all these other lawyers were scared to sign on the dotted line and plus was
great I'd met you by then you're obviously the best guy for it but the
fact they're now calling you a Nazi and you're getting threats that's fine
with me you know that's but but the lie because you you represent porn
companies you represent Nazis you represent vermin supreme you represent
left right center so the idea that you are your client is just intellectually a
complete fraud I mean they know that a defense lawyer that a First Amendment
lawyer that it's their job to go out and represent somebody and then to call
you a Nazi because you represented Nazis is just fraud look I I frankly
welcome it because you know you you judge a man by his enemies and the more
they're coming at you the more it means you're doing something right look I
read that New York Times hit piece and I just laughed you know and then of all
things the Huffington Post wrote a follow-up piece where they actually did
acknowledge yeah I represent I'm proud to represent vermin supreme the I mean I
represent a group of a political action committee of Muslim feminists you know
and then at the same time yeah I represent the Daily Stormer because I
think if you are a First Amendment lawyer and you pick and choose your
clients based on what they have to say you're not a First Amendment let's be
clear you're a hack those Nazi sides they they attack me constantly they say
things about my family that aren't true particularly a storm front or whatever
and you know what they have a right though I believe in the First Amendment
I'm a big boy but the left has said we get the Nazis first then we get everybody
else well that's the problem because it is you know when you had the whole
punch a Nazi meme and then it's well you can punch a Nazi and then anyone who
doesn't disagree with me is you know doesn't agree with me as a Nazi now you
just punch anybody who doesn't agree with me yeah you're a Nazi boom bottle
over the head right I mean you know kids wearing a make America great again hat
well since when does that you know wearing a symbol of a sitting president
whether you like him or not you know if you're wearing a if somebody is wearing
a since when does it get you whacked over the head we'll be back this 4th
of July is special everybody can see it they could feel it the globalists are
attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny and America yet again
is at the heart of the resistance the globalist that's why this 4th of July
I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about in full wars now more than
ever and what would the world be like if info wars wasn't there resisting the
globalist what would have happened if you hadn't supported info wars we would
not be having the victories we have today so yes a lot of good things are
happening but the enemy is striking back so please think about info wars and
funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the
4th of July that's so historic we have record sales going on right now free
shipping on hundreds of different items more than 20 items are 50% off like
rain force plus x2 is 40% off knockout sleep aid 1776 silver bullets 995
little silver and free shipping you can't beat that this 4th of July special
and our sales are special to match it in four store com living in volcano may
sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in
Lailania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we
need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy
metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy
levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and
pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure
gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the
Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash
and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a
good water filtration system will purify it feeling your body is hard work
that's why we've introduced the info wars life daily digestive pack to help
you fuel it right combine fluorolife everyday maintenance and carnivore to

second American Revolution.
You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones by the way I
had one of the editors walk in here earlier an article that's on news wars.com
and I'm not criticizing him for this because we try to you know check things
and go over things but normally it's something I'm gonna get sued for. This is
Judge Andrew DePolitano friend of mine respect him Roger Stone's basically his
best friend he's a really smart guy he's been on the list to do it as well I
don't think he's shower grapes he was very happy with Judge Gorsuch but he
says the heart and soul of the establishment is what this new judge is
Brett Kavanaugh and so the crew is like well we're pro-trumped are we gonna put
this out I'm like absolutely people ask about info wars they go in fact even
mainstream media goes you'll see a clip of a New York Times article or a news
week and you'll see one person saying this and another saying that we're just
trying to have a free discussion here and I like Clifford Cunningham I respect
our writer and I think this is a really good article you know that a lot of
people are concerned about this that he's two establishment Republican and
Judge DePolitano is really respected you know and he's got an issue and Rand
Paul's got an issue all I'm saying is Trump is so pragmatic about everything
he's doing for the average little guy and the results of it because I study
all these areas I was just talking about you know meat packing during the break
something my family within the cattle business has been involved in and out of
some big cattle families that are just getting out of the business because
there's three packing companies it's all rigged and then the cattle producers
cannot even make a living they've set it up like that well Trump behind the
scenes is looking I've been told to try to bust that up so you separating this
from Kavanaugh you were saying doing the deep dive on him and then looking at
what Trump's done in his policies I wouldn't even call him conservative I'd
call him Americana and I know you as a classical liberal will take heat for
this but you said no I want to say on air right now I like Trump so in your
own words I mean that's quite a coming out there yeah I mean I didn't vote for
him yeah you know and I don't have not as I voted for Gary Johnson but you know
I'm at this point I'm not gonna say I'm not voting for him in 2020 he has I
think this trade war that he's started I think the I want to see the outcome of
it I'm not smart enough and when it comes to economics I mean you asked me a
question about the First Amendment that I know economics I don't so I could be
crazy on this but I think the outcome of this is gonna be good for us I see him
looking at certain economic policies you know from almost a Teddy Roosevelt
standpoint more than more than an establishment standpoint so you know my
401k has never done so well so I'm also looking at that and like you said so
bad he wants to drive down drug prices not with a socialist answer but by
making them have competition and going wait you want to pay for somebody's
assisted suicide and I think if somebody wants to you know die that's fine
it's one of the government involved don't make me pay for it by the way but
you don't want thousands of drugs and treatments blocked sometimes for 20 years
given to someone who's terminal who chooses to try to save their life you
want me to pay for someone to kill themselves but I can't let them pay to
try to save themselves now when yeah when he loosened up the regulations for
experimental treatment yeah when I'm you know when you see somebody going to
Mexico for treatment because they can't try something here because it hasn't been
FDA approved and that's sad you know if you're desperate you're at the end of
your rope anyway I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to give that
a whirl how would you describe Trump I just think very pragmatic because he's
like look I'm not I love America because I'm all for trade other companies he
goes China can't have 30 40 50% tariffs yeah and China can't have lower taxes
us on us the corporate stuff that's a tariff you know one examples 280% tariffs
on all our dairy to Canada he goes we have zero on you he goes I'm gonna start
out with a hundred percent and they flip out how is it I can punch you in the
face 280 times but then I'm only gonna punch back a hundred and then I'm the
bad guy I mean and then I when I look at something like that that seems
reasonable at the same time I still have to admit where I'm ignorant and you know
I took one economics class in 1988 and I got to be in it so here's the bottom line
don't take my word for it I've read the CFR I don't have degrees and all this
stuff I read the boiled down real white papers not their propaganda in the news
they made the decision in the 50s they saw the leftist elites did and they said
America's got half the world's power half the world's wealth it's not fair
they were all really socialist and communist and academics and they said
let's build up China and other countries and let's have deals with
regulations to shut us down no regulations on them and let's transfer
power to those countries now that was the useful idiot level the big banks and
the big corporations they just wanted to dominate economically so China has been
set up to take us down the CFR said the new centuries the Chinese century
America's done and so then they rigged it mark where they would rise and we would
fall in Trump saying uh-uh-uh so it's totally right it is but you know it's
when I see when I see the way these regulations have worked to the benefit
of large corporations and you know we see essentially I mean I'm not really
sure the nation state is the best way to organize people but it sure beats an
unaccountable corporation and that's where I see or the Central Committee of
the Politburo the Chinese president is not a president he has been elected by
the Communist Party of thousand people the Politburo selected who could vote
and then they just made him dictator three months ago officially said well
now we can never vote to remove you and your vice president's a dictator well in
general you know when we look at the American system I have similar
criticisms because we only have you know we say isn't it terrible they have one
party rule well we have a duopoly and we have a duopoly that's almost
unbreakable but you're for term limits well I'm not just term limits I'm for
breaking up the duopoly I mean I think we should do anything we can to break the
backs of the Democratic and the Republican you know I used to feel like
that why should why should they trade off trade off power every four to eight
years they trade off power one way or the other and the rest of us are not
party hacks most of us you know most of us join one team or the other and as a
lawyer you know how complex they make the party apparatus exactly then that's
what keeps people from doing insurrections within the party sure I mean but
Trump just did it he just took the Republican Party over he did but you
know why do you think I mean I would have loved to see Trump versus Bernie
Sanders because then you have insurgents from both sides you know
instead the Democrats put their hack up and as usually happens you know it was
it should have been a have you heard and I confirmed it Hillary is planning to
run in 2020 well if that happens you know I am not gonna be very popular back
in Massachusetts but I'm voting for Trump then there's no way I could see
that happening I don't but I have the same objection to her that I have to
another Bush go into the White House oh it's just we don't need royalty in this
country exactly and if it's you know if the Republicans don't put up anybody
but a but a Bush I'll vote for a Trump if the Democrats want to put up a
Clinton again but look at her arrogance the Democratic Party's bankrupt she's
got a billion still in her campaign war chest a couple billion in her foundation
she did that on purpose she is the Democratic Party she owns it and she's
so arrogant that she thinks he's gonna stay it's crazy yeah I I mean look I
predicted she was gonna win so don't take my predictions and to the bank I
predicted Trump was gonna win yeah I died didn't I died woke up on an airplane
on the way to Warsaw and said I thought it was the ambient talking when I read
the screen so I really I was shocked but let me tell you a little secret the
military didn't get involved in hacking election it wasn't the Russians it was
the military and intelligence agencies blocked Hillary trying to steal some
key states and I mean we're not just Trump's not just doing this on his own
I you know not my not my area you know my area is the first amendment so when it
comes to saying they've got their whole shadow government but you know what
happens when the shadow government and the deep state rebels because he Trump's
like deep state deep state that's only the top globalist Democrats are trying
to block him the general deep state are just people in the whole I mean you know
how countries work I mean China's got a hundred million people outside its country
that are military aged men who are really intelligence operatives in their
companies and corporations Congress is about to have hearings on well you don't
think they're the only ones that do that right of course not I mean that's we've
had that blueprint for years yes the British Empire did it the French have
it we have it you know in China so the left that all you guys need to surrender
because it's over I mean you're not gonna win well and if you kill Trump
there's backup plans for that and here's the thing he did get elected he
actually won in a giant tsunami but they stole so many votes and so much stuff
that he almost lost well even if you go with the with the narrative that's
actually in the press I mean he did it fair and square you know that's how the
electoral college works it's there for a reason because we do not want I don't
want to live in a country that's simply New York Chicago and Los Angeles making
all the decisions and that's why we have the separation of powers that's why
we have the electoral college that's why we have all that and you're right
but see you're smarter than you say you are you're just you're just putting
provisos in there look what do you want to get into when we come back next hour
because you're on fire we got a lot to cover you know I think we were talking
about the political violence is probably a good thing to talk about we need to go
to those videos anti-fud tacking the left running foxes reporters out of the
Supreme Court I've been at the Supreme Court across the street don't even let
you film it and then meanwhile they say without a permit meanwhile they just let

you're listening to the alex jones show
all right next segment's longer so we'll get into the left's accelerating
violence with the top first amendment lawyer in his horror of it mark on
daza and again you're like okay great you know he's a liberal but a mainline
liberal would would would attack him he's a classical liberal it takes a lot
of courage I mean there's other top lawyers in this country who were you
know and they are all scared to death their law firms won't even let him
defend not just me but other conservatives and libertarians there's a
real chilling effect going on out there and that's why if Kavanaugh was a bad
guy on the first amendment that would be a big problem and I would oppose his
nomination I just don't want to oppose his nomination and then get something
worse so in the few months we've gotten this segment you've done the deep dive
yeah more of his rulings and statements and you were critical earlier when you
just kind of picked up some mainstream news but you've actually read the a bunch
of the rulings last night now you're be plus well you know I the case that I
knew him about was that a boss case where he he ruled that the anti-slap laws
shouldn't be used in federal court I think that's a bad thing I don't think
his analysis was correct he was following a an opinion by Alex Kaczynski from the
Ninth Circuit who's his former mentor and you know I can understand following
your mentor I got mentors out there that that I will always respect them even
if even if they're wrong I also didn't really like that he's a double Yale grad
I mean I think if there's one he's a super white shoe boy yeah if there's one
thing I think the Supreme Court really needs it needs diversity but I'm not
talking about diversity of race or gender although I think maybe a state
judge maybe a regular trial lawyer then how about somebody who didn't go to
Harvard or Yale because there is nothing magical about those institutions you
know except people talk about cabals who really secretly runs things yeah it's
Harvard or Yale it's it's whether it's whether it's Zuckerberg it's like
every damn one of them yeah I mean look but yeah one of the smartest lawyers I've
I've ever met a guy by the name of Bob Cornrevere he went to Catholic University
of America it's a third-tier school and the guy will you know I mean he sees he's
an idol of mine so we're not talking about like something magical happens to
you in Cambridge or New Haven that that makes you somehow smarter so that I
didn't like I didn't like his decision in a boss but you know that's that's
but back to this we can expand on this after we need to but it's become a
mafia even people that have gone there and a PhDs from there like Dr. Boyle we
have on he explains that it's not that they're that good they've gotten their
people all in the government and now they're only incestuously a form of
nepotism only bringing in their own yeah it's it's always you know it's always
like a relief to me when I see that a judge wasn't necessarily from Harvard
Yale or Stanford I mean there's there's no reason that we should be picking
judges only from those places now there's other schools that are you know I
don't know why the heck you wasted your money to go there that I wouldn't want
to pick people from but that's that's a very limited list as well well you're
from Georgetown it was always respected that Georgetown suing me I mean a very
shameful behavior yeah look I you know I Georgetown was the first time that I
started getting looked at as a conservative when I was like wait a
minute I'm a you know I'm a pretty left-wing guy from Massachusetts and
and I'm and I'm not buying into some of their deep political correctness we have
the guy coming on who started the walk away movement in 30 minutes and he's a
liberal gay guy and people are throwing him out of businesses trying to attack
him all because he says man the Democrats have become like a cult yeah
it's you know what I mean I think it's it's sort of a natural reaction that
everybody was so shocked when Trump got elected and you know the mantra on the
on the you know on the Democrats side was this is gonna ruin the country it's
gonna create the forthright it's gonna be the handmaid's tail if he gets
elected well now what happens if that doesn't happen then they're wrong and
you know what if they can't be wrong so they have to keep this narrative up that
is the crisis narrative and you know and like this is not healthy for us you know I
see people in in families not talking to each other over politics are you
kidding me I have people contacting your politics I have people contacting
basically threatening my family because they're my parents or my wife yeah it's
look it's crazy I mean I've you know it really is there's no need for it and I
think that anybody who starts to see that as a problem for any reason needs to
reach across and like I hang out with people that don't agree with me at all
I love hanging out yeah because if you don't do that you're in a cult we'll be
back with all the leftist violence stay with us

we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
mark remdas it's personal family stuff you're not the state of you don't want
to I was just talking about how they what they wage wars against our families
yeah just because you're a first woman lawyer the stuff that's happened to you
but I talked about taking my daughters to camp 10 12 days ago to drop them off
and there was info or stickers on trunks and and and and and like you know
10-year-old girls running up saying we love you and all like all of the camp
counselor boys when I pulled up because they were getting all the trunks and
putting them on a trailer to go to different camps like Alex Jones we love
you taking pictures but I saw some horrified liberal mothers like like and
they just don't get it like why are the young people ages like six seven eight
nine up to about 18 which they admit Generation Z is rebelling against SJW
garbage of course they do I mean that that's a natural thing for kids to do you
know it's like look back in the back in the 80s you know I was a punk rock kid
reacting against Reagan and I like punk rock I mean I like well conservatives the
new punk rock man I mean that's really what it is right now you know you see
these kids show I look at these kids who are showing up to college in in suits
and and styling themselves as conservatives I don't care if they're
misguided or not I look at it I'm glad they're finding a voice and I'm glad
they're not taking what their parents and their professors tell them as gospel
because that's how the marketplace of ideas grows that's that's how that's
how thought grows even if they come around I mean I admitted right here on
air my initial response to to the Cavanaugh was negative and now I'm
saying I did a little more research and I realized I think I was wrong that's
that's just it's a great thing when I see when I see kids arguing with their
parents over politics whether it's when I was arguing with my parents saying not
Reagan's terrible you know and and and you know and this is this is just a
horrible nationalistic jingoistic regime and then I see kids doing the same thing
to their SJW parents that's wonderful the kids are all right of course your dad
you were saying is a huge make America great again go my dad is probably one
of the biggest Trump supporters that that that exists yes and that's you know
I'm I'm pretty middle of the road you know and he's doing it though like an
area like Austin in Massachusetts well Massachusetts is yeah about as blue as
you can get so yeah he drives around with his I support Trump sticker on his
car and he doesn't care what anybody thinks which you know where did I get
just that's the chip I got from the old man but that's good I mean that's but
that's especially when they're trying to bully you then it makes it even more
valuable and does make me more aggressive people come up to me and yell and
call me names on like what planet are you from now let's get into that since
you mentioned it yeah you mentioned just I mean over 4th of July there were
hundreds of attacks the left calls it a new civil war they call it you know this
uprising Michael Moore all of them are calling for it then I point out that they
said they're launching it they make a joke out of it but let's roll some of
that video of the water burger with a guy grabbing them make America great again
hat throwing you know his eyes tea on him let's go ahead and roll that audio
then let's go into what happened in Portland and then let's go into what
happened this weekend in San Francisco a Christian prayer vigil and grown men
Antifa beating up women's let's go ahead while you're talking and roll some of
this video well you know initially when you know we saw the video earlier of
Richard Spencer getting punched now I don't approve of that I don't think it's
okay to punch a Nazi you know I think when you cross the speech violence
divide you're automatically wrong but then it was you know it had this allure
to it you could you could look at like well I'm just punching Nazis but then
everybody who doesn't agree with you as a Nazi and now it's this kid with his
make America great again hat you know getting attacked and it's and then it
just becomes Nazis are people I want to punch now what is the end result of that
it isn't like you can just you've just become a Nazi because the Nazis dehumanize
groups of people and then one after them well I mean my position is nobody's a
Nazi except the Nazis even I think even neo-nazis today in America are not what
you know what 1930 yeah they're not a bunch of disgruntled World War one
veterans that were half nerve-gassed and half alive all crazed following a
psychopath I mean I mean I saw the best way I saw people to shut down Nazis was
I saw a video a while back where this kid just followed a Nazi march with a
tuba and played this silly you know boom boom boom the tuba sound to it and it
made them look so ridiculous and I looked at it I thought it was a thing of
beauty they're exercising their first amendment rights he's exercising his and
and that was really even the guy made a joke out of it right that was the way
now this you see this kind of stuff and you look at this and you see this
violence I mean people are really getting hurt you know and they and a lot
of people think this just started in Charlottesville this didn't start in
Charlottesville this started in Berkeley you know this started on the
streets of DC and the performer hearts of supposed free speech I mean what I
don't want to see you know I see it goes from Richard Spencer to any kid in a
MAGA hat and you know and next it's you or me well listen I told the story
since the campaign I never got it on tape till Seattle they walk up in a
restaurant in front of your family and they knock your drink over or they
throw it on and I because first it was f you then it's knock your drink over or
throw something at you and then now it's punched you in the back of the head I
had a guy in Hawaii not the this last time the time before big guy and I was
just smart enough not to do it walk by slap me in the back of the head and call
me a Nazi and so didn't catch it on tape never really told the story till now
but this is what's going on and it's getting bad it is and you know and and
here's the problem is that the natural reaction is to show up with shields and
helmets and fight back and you know it's hard to tell somebody don't do that
but I think that not reacting the same way you know I think the biggest
strength that conservatives can have is don't react the same way and you know
maybe that means you got to take a punch and turn the other cheek I mean I'm
not the most Christian guy in the world but if if that's the lesson you have to
learn because well I mean I was sitting there I don't see us rise to a level of
actual civil war and right now when I look at this and I look at people
attacking one another in the streets men attacking women oh yeah look Antifa I
mean I you know I I know you don't like cussing in your show so I won't say
exactly what I think of them but bring it on I tell it I'll let you say it but
but but we'll delay it for TV and radio that's all right now I won't but you know
those those guys are a bunch of wooses I mean you kidding you're gonna show up
with a mask over your face to it yeah to attack kids and women because you think
that your politics are so damn correct or so damn righteous that that gives you
the right to cross the violence words divide dead wrong well look at how these
guys walk like they're so tough but meanwhile anytime a man fights them they
get laid on their ass oh yeah I mean you know they didn't have a mask over their
face I'll say what these are is usually street rat method criminals or rich kids
because we've we've I mean look at him beating up that woman and so these are
guys that that are just the scum of the earth I don't know what's really
troubling about it as you've seen some gov you know some local governments
almost endorse it oh Portland San Francisco and that is look the police
are supposed to be there to stop this kind of thing and you know as a as I
mean I like to consider myself a neutral observer of this because I'm not
about to go out there with with shields and bats on either side of this and I'm
certainly not identifying with antifa but when I see this happen whatever you
know the way I used to see things like this is you'd see the police acting as
a barrier so that the Nazis could but that's why they do it it's it's done in
Seattle it's done in Portland it's done in San Francisco it's done in Austin
because even in Austin the police to a certain extent they stand down yeah
they're ordered to do it and so you got 10 to 1 leftist beating up a prayer
vigil it's never even Nazis now because most the Nazis are fed run and you know
provocateur the leader will be a fed the others are idiots but the other prayer
vigil usually it's like Hispanic when black Christians you know a few white
people standing up and then here come people beating them up calling them
Nazis and it's a prayer vigil and it's just it's just insane to see the cowardice
exactly in these blue cities where they got everything on their side and then a
bunch of wobbly big-budded soy boys who came out of their World of Warcraft
basements to act like tough guys in Austin they come out with guns and
pointed them at Owen and said you're shaking aren't you boy and wouldn't
let him into a park for an event yeah yeah this is I mean this is this is our
reporter by himself out there with people saying we're gonna hurt you and
hitting him with clubs right with guns and you know you you can't just say we
know we're I mean what are you protecting if you're doing that like what is
that it just horrifies me and what I'm worried about is you know I see I hear
from a lot of conservatives that say well we're gonna go armed we're gonna go
ready to defend ourselves we're gonna go ready to protect ourselves and it's
it's hard to argue with that logic and then they're gonna get their Charlotte
Phil event they want yeah and you know that was there's a horrible tragedy that
happened there and what it's but it's the natural result well the police stood
down and then they heard it the alt-right people most of them are just
reporters covering the alt-right they heard it the very suspicious guys with
all the Democrat backgrounds rest up like Nazis into the anti-fund that
somebody got killed we'll be right back with Mark Rundaz and stay with us

you're listening to the alex jones show
you're not a dog about just let me know if you want to go to the
whole mountain range they got a lot of nice girls
well mark ron does is here with us really smart guy you're gonna podcast
with us we're about to put the big podcast studios launch and turn TV and
radio we really already got over 400 TV affiliates over 80 cable stations just
in six months it's a lot of exciting things happening look if I can get more
people to you know believe in the neutral principle of the first
amendment I'm happy to do it it's exciting you know and and you know
neutral principles of the first amendment do process and non-violence I
mean if you can you know you convert one person to believe in those things then
then I'm happy let me ask you this question knowing how people were being
one of the top you know known trial lawyers out there for the first
amendment and also one of the legal theorist guys that's that's quoted
everywhere looking at this fight with the left committing to be anti-free
speech looking at the left really becoming everything they claim they're
opposing and being financed by a lot of big corporations cold-bloodedly who
want to control this country because they don't want Trump doing populist
things that are good for the people now that's what he does he's fired all the
lobbyist everything it's just incredible how selfless it is and I'm not
somebody to grovel at somebody's feet it's just true and I've been persecuted
for the truth as well to sit there and see that mark and disagree if you want
to obviously at a gut level how do you see this fight ending I mean it's up to
all of us but I just know we're in an epic struggle right now and the left
because they've lost is like trying all these things that no one else does
because attacking women and children and old people gets you totally discredited
or killed and I'm not saying I'm gonna kill you I'm just saying the road they're
going down is a villainous and I don't understand why they don't see it's
hurting them look I got I got two predictions I got an optimistic one
and pessimistic one for a long time the right is where the cold wind blew from
you know the right didn't want communist speech and First Amendment lawyers
defended the communists defended pornographers and we defended people
that the right and the religious wanted to shut down unpopular religious views
what have you now that polarity has flipped and I'm looking at this is such
a great opportunity because when I can talk to right-wing people and they are
all starting to dig down deep and hold on to that marketplace of ideas that
Oliver Wendell Holmesian view of the of of a robust First Amendment and I say
great now stay put and keeping them put there because it's going to change the
wind is going to change and then it's going to be from the other side I agree
here's the problem I keep enough people staying put on that ground when then
left-wing speech gets attacked again maybe we wind up one day and I can look
around at a crowd of people and I got leftists and rightists and I've got
communists and fascists all sitting together saying okay we disagree on
all this stuff but we agree on freedom of expression and that is that's like
that's the dream of America that's the Eagles blood you know that's that's
what this is that's what fuels the country that's that's what we are man I
mean look if we are not the Constitution America is not a country like any
other alright you know in we're not an ethnic state we're not all relate I
mean I have nothing in common ethnically with a native Hawaiian or
somebody who's so what we have is the Bill of Rights the Constitution and the
fact that just a little bit of that made us so successful it shows the
marketplace of ideas is king and that people will in a real free market go
with what's best so anybody that thinks they're promoting what is the answer you
should support free speech because you're going to win right America is an
idea it is that idea and you know if we lose that then what are we we're
nothing we really mean nothing now that's the positive you only get the
negative but but negative is is much worse okay I see that it could go the
other way because what we have is people increasingly now I hear people on the
right saying let's treat the left the way they treat us let's beat them at
their own that's where I was trying to go and interrupt it because I see the
right wing going well if you censor them for their speech then you got a
censor the other side adopting it now becoming the police of it and that's
what I'm worried about you know I'm really worried because it's a natural
human reaction is hey you guys want to do it to us we're sick of it we're gonna
do it to you and then you break the ideal down and all we are is divided into
tribes and then tribes divide into violence and next thing you know
country's collapse every civil war starts this way and I'm not saying there's a
civil war coming I'm just saying even now we're in like a very cold civil war
and I hate seeing that you know I believe in what this country is supposed to
stand for and I want people to come around to say you know let's let's stick
with that neutral principle and by the way you're absolutely right and there
are outside corporate and international powers on record fomenting this communist
China owns most of Hollywood now they're fomenting all this race war crap all this
man against woman stuff that the weakest minds are buying into and I don't know
how I tell an average leftist at Antifa call themselves mal youth brigades when
they take their black off the early communist I video of it all of the
country Mao and it's like dude Mao Mao they kill Buddhist they put them in
communist China is a nightmare for people why would you be endorsing that
yeah yeah I remember when I was in college it was a group of Maoists so
what's wrong with you I can see you being a Leninist or I can see you
believing in communism that look every philosophy is something in it worth
learning from even communism but Maoism what is wrong with you look there's no
pull you know maybe a pull pot brigade would be a little more ridiculous but yeah
well that's because you're actually are an intellectual actually know about Mao I
mean it was the biggest failure the Chinese say it was he killed 80 plus
million people it's a total frickin nightmare but they choose like the
worst thing because it started on college campuses and then they took over
with young people bullying everyone else I'm telling you this anti-famove is a
Maoist attack but they're all about deception oh we're anti-fascists no
they're Maoist so I can take you to UT right now or I can take you to
Southwest Texas any universities within 20 miles and I'm telling you they are
we've gone to their meetings we've infiltrated them they are Maoists they
actually prayed a mouse attack it's just absurd I mean I there's I can
understand any kind you know the allure of some extreme philosophies it's always
gonna be alluring to some 15 year old kids 16 year old kid 19 year old kid I
mean it's that that's when you're exploring oh my god you're right yeah
but now I mean that's you know Mao and child molestation are probably the two
things and I'm like there's no reason to experiment with those so look my
pessimistic view is we have people who just simply divide into tribes we decide
that as that win changes next thing you know we use the tricks the right uses
the tricks that the left was using the left uses the tricks the right was
using and then we have nobody left in the middle saying let's defend this one
principle so you might what I what I'm finding so difficult to do though is to
yell at people on the right and say just stay where you are if the left had
done that you know back when they were defending communist speech they were
defending porn they were they were the ones who were really you know allowing
religious liberty you know getting rid of compelled speech I mean we owe the
left so much when it comes to protection of freedom of expression but you can
argue because they're just here they were only doing it to undermine the
existing structure once they got in they try to block it look I don't care why
they were doing it I care what they did and you know we owe if you believe in
the First Amendment like its heritage is leftist but now I I'm just shocked when
I see people who you know ten years ago would have said something completely
different now saying well maybe the First Amendment isn't such a great thing or
hell they're they're saying they want to basically repeal it in the cases against
me thank you so much we'll have you on the broadcast more today marker and

you're listening to the alex jones show
resistance to tyrants his obedience to god it's alex jones so brandon
struck is a gay hairdresser from new york and the founder of hashtag walk
away from the top hashtags last two weeks and a movement that calls for
walking with a democratic party of violence intolerance divisiveness and
hatred and you've got state reps doing it you've got congress folks talking about
it got Alan Dershowitz talking about leaving the party until they stop
acting like crazy maniacs I mean it's just crazy so brandon joins us again
hashtag walk away you can see his twitter there on screen and he recently went
into an electronic store and they wouldn't sell a microphone saying that
he they thought he was quote alt right so this is very very dangerous precedent
we've seen fox news reporters obviously run out of the supreme court building
last night by angry crowds we've seen the physical attacks the calls for
kidnapping and raping baron by hollywood stars it's just a very vicious
climate antifa beating people up all over the place I mean the republicans
acted like this I wouldn't even support the republican party I was arrested
twice by George W. Bush for asking questions at press conferences and
thought that he was a horrible person and I I still do so I'm a libertarian but I
like Trump because he's turning the country around but enough from me brandon
strock joins us at US minority or us minority and there's so much to talk
about he's in London and I just appreciate his courage because living in
New York and doing what he does particularly being you know a former
democrat and then you know still I would guess a liberal is what they're really
afraid of they really bully people they really attack people that are free
thinkers and aren't being inducted into this cult by successive approximation so
Brandon thanks for coming on with us thank you for having me where should we
start I mean start at the beginning and then just go through what's happened the
last few weeks as your movement has become so huge I think because it
strikes on the nerve of many liberals I know many progressives who now are
abandoning the democratic party well you know I was a lifelong democrat I was
always a liberal and I after the election of Donald Trump I saw a lot of
things that really opened my eyes to how dishonest the media had been during
his campaign and how even more dishonest they were after his election and that
would have been bad enough on its own I think but as a gay man I think where the
line was really crossed for me was it became very very clear that the media
was using minorities by telling us you know putting out these stories that were
designed to kind of terrify us and keep us in this you know they were selling
fear it was just fear mongering and it took a little while to figure that out
and it took the help of some you know people that were close to me pointing
that out to me well once I saw it was one of those things that you can't ever
unsee and so I started trying to kind of speak out about this to other people from
two different perspectives one was you know people were running around literally
hysterical saying we have a Nazi in the White House we have a Nazi in the White
House he's staffing his administration full of you know KKK and I'm thinking to
myself well you know I'm discovering that this actually isn't true so I'm
approaching people and saying look things aren't as bad as they seem this
thing that you're so upset about this thing you're so angry and worked up
about actually it's kind of being made up by the media but what I was met with
was not people going oh thank goodness you've showed me something that you know
makes it so that I don't have to be so upset they were upset with me for
bringing them evidence that you know Trump's actually not such a horrible
human being after all and maybe we don't have a Nazi in the White House I
started to think well this is pretty peculiar it's almost as though they just
want to hate him you know it's people don't want to be presented with evidence
that shows that you know things aren't as bad as they seem well the more people
started turning on me and unfriending me saying nasty things to me dragging my
reputation through the mud I thought you know I'm not gonna put up with this I'm
gonna fight back and I sat down and I wrote what I call kind of the
definitive manifesto of everything that's wrong with liberalism and the
Democrat Party and the reason why they're involved is because all of these
politicians that I had trusted for so long who I thought actually cared about
me cared about my community they went along with all of this you know I mean
they everything every lie that the media put out every false story or every
omission they were right there anytime there was a microphone in their hand to
back it up and say oh yes oh yes he's expected to sign an executive order
taking all of your rights away this week we're doing what we can to stop it you
know they went right along with all the fear mongering so I created this video
and I created a movement which is basically encouraging people to walk
away from the Democrat Party walk away from liberalism I'm not telling anyone
where to go if they end up finding themselves on the right like I have
great I now with my registered Republican and after a lot of research and you
know really really digging deep I'm a Trump supporter now and I can't wait to
vote for him in 2020 but you know I'm not telling anyone where to go or what to
believe or what to do I'm saying open your eyes do your own research and at the
very least look at the toxic divisiveness hostility and now basically
call very close to if not exactly calling for violence on the left and get
away from it well exactly but take take Donald Trump because there's obviously
been some you know anti-gay bigot is tough it's called the Republican Party
before but that's gone away the last few decades but Trump with Peter Thiel who
got outed by the liberals because he wouldn't be their minion and then he's
out there and you got Donald Trump saying let's all be together and let's all be
friends which everybody should applaud the media wouldn't even cover it and
they said Trump's anti-LGBT at his convention and just none it's the
lying and that's why so many people like Candice Owens she had the feminist
movement online stalking her she confirmed posing as right-wing males
harassing her and she learned it was them using it to steer because she was
smart good-looking like you to steer her under their control it's a cult and when
you find out well you're trying to program me to sit there and hate other
people and be your slave I mean it may make it from folks I've talked to like
Candice it makes you mad oh yeah it makes me very angry makes it very angry and
it's you know and you know when I became a liberal I thought it was because you
know I wanted to be around other people you know I had always heard you know
everybody on the right is very racist everybody on the right is you know very
small-minded and bigoted you know I believe these messages that I heard
from the left and whether it was ever true or not at this point it's safe to
say we have very much over corrected and at this point all of those things that
I became a liberal to fight against liberalism now is you know I mean it's
just a constant hostility towards white people it's constant hostility towards
men there's this bizarre push to sort of demonize heteronormativity and and
myself as a gay man it's you know it's not even about gay rights anymore it's
now about adding all of these bizarre sub acronyms your LGBTQ I don't know what
gender fluid means I don't know what two-spirit means I don't know what gender
non-binary is but I'm told all the time now that as a gay man I'm privileged and
that you know these other non-binary gender fluid people in my community are
victims of oppression and that I am a privileged white gay man so I should
shut my mouth and march along with what they tell me to do and then you learn
the Tabastog Institute cooked it all up it's it's it's mind control and they're
using America's openness and the fact that we are a very classically liberal
society against us and then bringing in authoritarianism as the answer to free
people and really all it is is classic fog of war confusion but look I can tell
what they're scared of you I mean you're very articulate and you've got a lot of
charisma and I think you should be very very careful I know you've already been
threatened and stuff we'll talk about when we come back it's not about
victimology I get threatened and attacked too but let me tell you they're
scared of you because you are you're a good-looking guy you're articulate you're
telling the truth we're about to go to break but how much harassment have you
dealt with well it's been I've actually been dealt with more harassment on a
personal level than on a public level the public level I guess I don't really
care about that much I just sort of disregard those messages but some
really nasty stuff from people who have known me for a long long time and
should know better exactly so you've had family you've had friends turn on you
walk away from you oh yes oh yes only if only they walked away I mean believe me
there were some choice words on the way out the door well Mark Randolph didn't
want to tell the story his first-minute lawyer would happen to him with his
family it's it's just it's crazy and he's like a liberal first-minute lawyer
and they're calling him you know I mean it's crazy Brandon we'll be right back

full wars life calm living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
the real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the
big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid
rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of
tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in
fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we
tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the
heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal
levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will
purify it

you're listening to the alex jones show
crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the
GCN radio network
and the Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what
he doesn't do that he's mean as a Wolverine it's 1159 radio free America
and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn right now I got a few
words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone the chair is
against the wall the chair is against the wall John has a long mustache John has
a long mustache it's 12 o'clock American another day closer to victory and for
all of you out there on a behind the lines this is your song
but they took a lot of people away people that they thought we're gonna make
trouble for them people that had guns and things they wanted they just took
them away where we education can't say they call it so part of the race you
are kind of the private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong
to their families recognize kids belong to the whole community I have decided
we really need camps for adults all persons of Japanese descent were required
to register now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the
army almost overnight had built assembly centers what kind of a situation in the
US would you see that happening I mean we've got a lot of people that are
coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build
IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques these people are radicalized
and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United
States it's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal
community
this is what we're doing here unless not hit about it we're building a domestic
army because the government is afraid of its own citizens put your gun down
really rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex
Jones are you some kind of a constitutionalist
from if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
America's prize in a bunch of multinational corporations are using race
war culture war to the WikiLeaks and turn us against each other doesn't mean
those there isn't racism or any that stuff going on it means that there are
people exacerbating it let me tell you Brandon Strock of the walk away movement
that's just been out for two weeks it's being demonized and attacked by the
entire left and let me tell you I know when destiny happens I know at a gut
level when I've just heard the answer so as soon as I get off air here and Paul
Watson takes over 15 minutes from London where guests just happens to be I am
gonna get on the phone the bat phone and I never call the bat phone believe me
they're gonna answer because I never call when I call it's always you know
important and get them on the phone with this gentleman because because I know
when I heard it that it was victory to unify America to stop the Civil War he
wasn't gonna announce it today but he's gonna go ahead and get into some of it
he won't get into behind-the-scenes stuff but I know this has been brought to
the president but you can't do much to the White House because that's so
controlled because the national security issues you got to do it through the
campaign so Brandon please lay out what you said and then also how they're
attacking you and you know they're ridiculous just info because when
people walk away from the Democrats and in capitals across the country and in
DC come together and hug each other left and right for a future of America and
the Antifa shows up there's only a half dozen of them it is going to be Martin
Luther King level I have a dream stuff I mean I just know destiny I hear it so
you're asking my advice I think you should tell people your millennium level
idea I mean it's it's like one of those ideas that you only hear a few times in
a lifetime and usually people ignore it this is history and that's why there's
just so please tell folks the idea you came up with yeah you got it Alex um so
so you know a lot of what's coming out of left right now is this narrative that
my campaign is Russian bots which is absolutely ridiculous of course we have
real people giving testimonials for the walk away campaign but it's sort of
sparked an idea in my mind since there's gonna be a lot of naysayers out there
who are going to try to dismiss this campaign and what's happening with walk
away as bots and as not real I thought to myself you know what we really need to
do is I'm going to organize a walk away march on Washington a nationwide walk
away march and what this is going to be is really unifying people from the left
unifying people from the right bringing everybody together kind of on the same
page and listen if you're not walking away from the Democrat Party that's fine
but I think that at this point people should at least be willing to say I'm
walking away from the hatefulness I'm walking away from the divisiveness I'm
walking away from the violent rhetoric and the division so this is what I want
to do I want to in the fall have a an amazing demonstration organization
nationwide where we do a nationwide march on Washington I want it to be the
biggest most incredible and most powerful March this nation has ever seen I
totally agree and like you said you need the president to get involved that
will make it all happen quicker but they're gonna try to launch a summer of
rage and civil war in their own words so I think at least the first level of the
march where you know in New York or DC or or wherever you pick to as a
prototype have the police out everything and just have it be a march of unity to
support the First Amendment and progress for America does he mean you're walking
away from the Democrats you mean and for some of the right wing doesn't mean
stuff too I'm not perfect and because my turn which is on a few weeks ago and he
says he's a smart guy he said he felt it just like a couple years ago a new
Trump win just like I did he had he has this image of not attacking the left
anymore even when they attack us but just trying to hug them like Kanye West has
been talking about and of course they'll still be haters but I agree
check mating these globalists trying to make us all these social engineers fight
with each other and just having a march where we're all over here and this is
our side liberal conservative whatever we're gonna hug we're gonna call for
unity we're gonna call for not being violent and then let the haters be over
here and I think it's gonna be so clear that it's gonna devastate him but here's
the deal you think they're after you now this idea your leadership why did not
think of this they're really gonna come after you now and I'm not just saying
that I know in my gut level so I asked you I said do you have a Kickstarter or
go fund me yeah we just set it up I said listen even before he came on I said
you know I want to make a $10,000 donation I've got a lot of money this
fella because I can tell what he's doing really scares them and it's really good
and then once I heard you say yeah when what do I do I need to talk to the
president I need to try to get some help we need to help you right now so you've
just launched you know a a funding operation trying to get some basic
money for this you need to be flooded folks and believe me I know at a gut
level what's gonna work and what's not so if people fund this I couldn't see a
better place for people to do it so I'm pledging 10,000 that will donate right
after the show to the account I want it online I want people to see that happen
so please make sure that happens you've raised $26,000 you need to raise way
more than $30,000 to launch something that is walking away from the globalist
trying to cause a civil war we have their own documents this is beautiful
walk away from the race war walk away from the sex war walk away from the
globalist and Soros instituted civil war he's trying to fund that that's just
beautiful please continue how do folks go donate right now well there are two

you're listening to the alex jones show
the incredible international movement walk away hashtag walk away he's here
and he shared with me this idea you're gonna call me a russian bot you're gonna
make all these lines up I don't be able to come together in mass rallies but we've
been talking about this and I can tell you I know the White House is already on
it and we're gonna make some phone calls as soon as I'm off in five minutes but
listen things are moving fast please come back on tomorrow for 30 minutes so you
can just talk because I'm really impressed no wonder they're so scared in
the four minutes we have left Brandon what else you want to impart to people
about your vision and and and really this quick the this this shift we're
seeing not just by you but when I go to the mall I get mobbed by minorities
blacks Hispanics Asians they want to come together they want freedom they see
through it I think libertarian conservatism americana is the new punk rock
I absolutely agree I friends of mine and I always say that conservatism is the
new counterculture it's actually so much more fun over here and it's actually so
much more inclusive you know and and there's so much more actual love and
tolerance happening on the right than there is on the left I mean I guess I
think that's a good ending point right there you asked me what do I want to say
I mean if I were to speak directly to my own community or even racial minorities
in America you know I would say to these people look the people on the left and
the Democrats want to try to tell you over and over again that they're on your
side they're looking out for you that you're only safe with them but the truth
of matter is they're actually using fear tactics to keep you in a constant state
of terror so that you'll they can manipulate your behavior and that's not
happening on the right in fact on the right I'm finding a lot of of love and
warm embrace from from the whole community over here since I began the
walk away campaign and I want I want minorities in America know to know that
you have a choice you don't have to be a Democrat you don't have to be a liberal
you actually have a seat at the table on the right there's a lot of really great
people who would love to have you over on the right in the thinking class of
people and I hope that people consider walking away and I like how you made the
point beyond even walking away from the Democrats to be great the Democrats
reformed themselves and became you know free thinkers again we need more than
two parties not just one that's being half decent now it's very frightening
we've only got one party halfway operating you know in reality because
Republicans have their own problems is that just walk away from the Democrat
cult walk away from the buses show up with the new kids go into college and
they bring them in and go you got to be in our group this is the professors
they're all out to get you there's Nazis on campus then they go spray paint
swastikas on their dorm at night hundreds of times and get caught this
is what they did to Candace Owens I mean it's like it's so authoritarian this is
the new authoritarianism and people are rejecting it yes well I mean the other
day I was refused service at a store by another gay man yeah so yeah and what do
you say I think you're all right you're gonna use this for speech so you can't
have it as if you're even all right that some Hillary Southern poverty loss
center you know at I mean let me tell you almost all those Nazi leaders have
been proven to be operative okay they're actors it stays I'm sorry I'm ranting
it's just to say that you're all right or I'm all right is horsemen are I don't
even know what alt-rate means I don't think anybody really knows what it means
but I can tell you that I'm not all right I'm actually just a really good
person I believe in equality for all people I believe in empowering all
people in America whether they be black white straight gay I think everybody
deserves an equal opportunity and an equal chance and that's what I'm about
so I if that's all right then I don't know look at it Kanye just the energy
and from you it's just a an energy of we're not gonna be controlled we're
gonna move forward we're not gonna be inducted in this politically correct
cult and that is that is universal that is unifying yeah absolutely I mean you
know as gay people you know we kind of went through this civil rights struggle
to you know we're fighting for you know marriage equality this and that we got
that and this at in my opinion should be the most exciting time in anybody in
the gay community's life because we're not even a wedge issue anymore nobody's
our rights are not up for debate and so this should be a time where it's like
we get to be full participants in the democratic state they're creating a new
wedge and saying you're now part of the elite class let me say about you're in

you are either with the Republic or against it resistance to Titans is
obedience to God I love the smell of victory in the morning and if you're a
leftist authoritarian control freak or a right-wing control freak this in your
show and I understand that we're trying to unify around believing in free market
and religious freedom and economic freedom and we've got a big tent for
everybody and we just had Brandon Strachan who has launched the hashtag
walk away movement and the left just like they call me a Russian bot or
Trump a Russian bot he then had the idea to have a nationwide march and he got
it directly to the present I've been authorized to say that but then a few
days went on and so I'm gonna try to get him ponied up hitched up with some
folks and that's why I do a lot of this behind the scenes who can understand
how big this is and I recommended how this should be done this is such a big
deal I would have some Oprah Winfrey style deals in a control environment
because the left's gonna try to infiltrate this for the left and right
who don't agree with the left and all the race war to come together and say we
believe in a future we believe in not having civil war we believe in not
having violence if the president a chance to see it you know have everybody
from Peter teal to you know you know from Judge Napolitano do you name it
there because I the wizards never talking he just keeps walking I don't
even need to be involved in I'm the bad guy that hits the barbed wire and says
all the hard things and gets the attacks I don't even want to sit at that
table you know I've been offered one I will not be there and that's my job I
never talk I just keep walking even though I talk when I'm saying I'm
always moving on to the next target so let me tell you I know zeitgeist when I
see it I know victory when I see it this walk away thing is explosive and I was
the mall this weekend and I was mobbed by Hispanic Americans mobbed because they
know the media is pumpkin everybody in playing games and and then every walk
in life guys with tattoos families you name it black families you name it but
I saw some white people came over and shook my hand but it was me but I'd see
liberals one and then they would get even more freaked out some of the
liberal store clerk saw me sitting there taking photos with Hispanic family
Hispanic family like six seven in a row and I saw some leftists just like they
were looking and I even walked over my wife's like please don't turn your
camera on I like let me guess you don't like me and the guy looks down he goes
Alex I don't know what to think anymore see I took my daughter's we can have a
go to camp and I pull up where they take to go to get all their trunks and their
trunks off and all that it's all the young you know 60 70 18 year old camp
counselors the males are there you know their evil gender role unloading the
trunks and they're all listeners and then I go to take both my daughters to
their camp separate areas this big complex and there's him full-war stickers
I'm looking here they're Paul Watson they love him they love Steven Crowder we
are so close to victory right now and thanks to Kanye and Drudge and and
everybody and it's a magic time Paul it's a magic time what do you think of
this Brandon Strock idea of a nationwide March and and movements
everywhere of people that don't want to kill each other people that don't hate
each other from the left and right coming together not even walking away
from the Democrats I say that too but walking away from the hate and walking
away from any Democratic rally they always tell you they always tell the
Democrats don't talk to Alex or don't talk to anybody don't talk to Fox News
don't talk to it's a cult no we're gonna talk walk away from the cult that
tells you don't talk Paul how big is this I mean in a gut level it's big
because they no longer have an argument Alex the reason they say don't talk to
people is because that muscle has become so flaccid that argument muscle that
they don't have one so to even engage in a conversation is means automatic defeat
to them because they've got no argument whatsoever in fact I don't know if you've
seen the video I wrote an article about this about a couple of hours ago it's
up on him for Wars.com it's literally a guy outside the Supreme Court with a
bullhorn reading out constitutional passages and they're just screaming in
his face it's like scream helplessly at the sky but they're doing it in this guy's
face and it's literally all they've got what's the name of the article everybody
needs to get this viral info wars.com what's the name of the viral for the
article oh just 300 show up for protest against Trump's Supreme Court it's not
that one it's the later one I'll find it I'll find it we'll go back to a minute
liberals triggered into literal screaming fit by man reading Constitution it's
up on him for Wars.com right now. So yeah basically the only criticism you get
for that walk away movement is oh but you're playing identity politics
Alex well no way we're using identity politics in some senses to unite people
they only ever use them to divide people so that's where people can actually
come together and have an impact and when all you've literally got is having a
screaming hissy fit in someone's face as a means of conversation that's not gonna
resonate very well with any right thinking person is it so at this point
my way ahead of the game Alex. We'll have that audio and video you're taking over
right now you got a big guest coming on I should have mentioned that thanks for
letting me hijack it but I always love talking to you here on air Paul but
but but exactly we're saying to Democrats that are disillusioned by the
hating America rhetoric all the race baiting all the Russian bot crap who are
sick of Hillary getting ready to run again just come out and meet us like a
neighborhood you know party or something and and everybody that wants to
fight with each other over there everybody that wants to come together
and hug come over here the witchy leaks all of it is about division and we're
about unity just saying we're all allowed to have freedom of speech I think
this just like you said hashtag walk away was genius it's so simple don't do
anything violent whatever walk away and then walk away and find normal people
and come together I'm telling you we have just discovered the next level I
know it we've I'm telling we got all of us I could tell that guy's totally for
real you just we've got a fully get behind this Paul yeah then we see
similar things happening in the UK you've probably heard about this Trump
baby balloon that's gonna be flowing over houses of parliament when Trump
visits on Friday he's not gonna visit London look they're gonna do it anyway
okay so it took them it took them about a month with sustained mainstream media
coverage a month to raise about 30,000 pounds which is about 40,000 dollars to
pay for that Trump balloon somebody did an oppositional response to that a
Sadiq Khan baby balloon it took them three days to launch a greater amount of
money with zero press attention whatsoever virtually zero so your guests
was talking about you know conservatism as a new counterculture they can no
longer claim to be anti-establishment in fact when you dig into this the people
behind the Trump baby balloon they're very wealthy they own like two million
the guy who paid for it owns two million townhouses in London he's from a
wealthy political million that townhouses no I mean two million pounds but
he's from a wealthy political family it's claiming that it's anti-establishment
okay you're not anti-establishment you're upper middle class you've got a
smorgasbord of mainstream media attention to get this fun and all you
can raise 30,000 pounds for $50,000 my only question is why is the Sadiq Khan
baby balloon why are his diapers not full of crap we need brown diapers on
that piece of crap or you could make it into a kind of pig which in fact that
has been suggested by the organ oh he's an Islamist a pig in diapers a pig with
his head on it actually Piers Morgan who suggested that because it was Sadiq
Khan that approved the Trump baby blimp I mean he's not busy enough with all the
violent crime happening in London he had time to approve that though so is he
gonna approve himself as a baby a pig baby and is that gonna be flown over
London because they've already got it funded they're just waiting on approval
and that is the guest who I'm gonna be talking to later today on the show and
let's not forget that baby is kicking their butt up and down the street well
it will be yeah but we've got a Trump visit this weekend Friday you know we've
had visits from Erdogan the Islamist dictator of Turkey the crown prince of
Saudi Arabia they torture people they put gay people in camps they're basically
walk room and all's what they're doing in Yemen no protest against that but
Donald Trump comes the leader of the free world and they all spit out their
dummies they're all out on the streets once again Alex you're taking over Paul

dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in Leilani
estates but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rain water and we need to
be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to
find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what
we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity
filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH
was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa
pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and
acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
water filtration system will purify it Alex Jones here with an extremely

Live from the infowars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show
and now your host Paul Joseph Watson we'll have this fourth hour of the Alex
Jones show on this July 10th edition 2018 in the next segment we're gonna talk
to our guest who is Yanni Brewer he is the man behind the Sadiq Karn baby
balloon which is a counter protest in essence to the Donald Trump baby balloon
that's gonna be flown over the houses of parliament or at least nearby on
Friday when Trump visits the United Kingdom he's not going to be visiting
London at all because basically a cowardly conservative in name only
government would not extend the invitation of a state visit to Donald
Trump it's only gonna be a working visit so he's not even gonna get anywhere
near London basically because they're so petrified God forbid that protesters
might emerge again a damning indictment of the cowardice the sheer unparalleled
cowardice of our conservative in name only government there's basically just
betrayed Brexit full-scale now and finally at least they're being honest
about the fact and we can move forward from that position but we're gonna talk
about the Trump balloon the Sadiq Karn balloon later on let's talk first about
YouTube which has basically introduced a new guidelines or new algorithm
changes once again without notifying that they're subscriber base without
notifying their biggest creators obviously they do that every single time
headline out of wired news YouTube debuts plan to promote and fund
authoritative news what GI wonder what this is gonna be all about following a
year in which YouTube has repeatedly promote a conspiracy theory videos it
didn't promote them they just happen to pop up during breaking news events like
the shootings in Parkland the company now announced Monday a slew of new
features it helps will make news on the platform more reliable and less
susceptible to manipulation the company is also investing 25 million dollars in
grants to news organizations looking to expand their video operations now this
is the key point according to YouTube executives the goal is to identify
authoritative news sources bring those videos to the top of users feeds and
support quality journalism so in other words all these news organizations who
exist on YouTube a totally crap at it they don't know what the hell they're
doing they need the system to be gained they need a helping hand simply to
compete with the people on YouTube who do know what they're doing that's what
it's all about you go and look at some of these news organizations the likes of
CNN I mean combined my own channel Alex Jones channel got more subscribers than
CNN or at least it did on last check most of their videos don't go viral you
look at YouTube platform YouTube content creators like MSNBC mainstream news
organizations NBC CBS they're terrible they don't know what they're doing they
don't know how to have viral videos they're not solely focused on it so now
they're going to be given a handout basically not like that you know giant
monopoly conglomerate organizations already was huge swaths of money coming
in they're going to be given huge amounts of money by Google to compete with
other people on YouTube and that's not enough no they need to change the
algorithm to rank all these legacy media news outlets above everyone else
because even with millions and millions of dollars flooding into their coffers
that still is not enough to help them compete because they're so utterly
useless anodyne pouring nobody wants to watch them so they need the system to
be gained this is what I've been warning about but over a year now the fact
they were all slaves to the algorithm in fact you can look at the search engine
obviously YouTube is owned by Google look at the search engine as well I mean I
can search for headlines they're almost verbatim what I wrote on info wars.com
or the key terms of an article I wrote for info wars.com about anything mainly
about the migrant crisis and things like that the top 10 the top 20 links on the
first page snopes.com Washington Post all these ridiculous fact-checker
websites that have proven to be completely partisan completely biased time
and time again even when you put in key terms for an article it ignores those
terms and simply throws up negative information for example about Alex
Jones no Alex Jones has caught he searched for stuff about the migrant
crisis articles I wrote a year ago two years ago it comes up with Alex Jones's
court case there's nothing whatsoever to do with it because they've artificially
gamed the algorithm to promote negative information about info wars.com about
Alex Jones and put it above above the information that you're actually
searching for so that that intent on by on burying information on manipulating
people we've had studies which we featured before where they can shift
millions and millions of votes on the day of an election simply by placing one
candidate above above another in a Google search result they can shift
millions of votes they've proven it in India in all these different countries so
it doesn't matter how much reach you have really if they control the algorithm
then we're in trouble that's why you know that that's now finally starting about
some kind of government regulation basically Google search ranking
manipulation is affecting elections they did a giant study into this in India and
a couple of other countries and again depending on the platforms how they
were how they were presented in a negative or positive light and the
search results in order they could shift millions and millions of votes now
they're doing the same on YouTube and talking about in fact they mention us
they get into it in this article that's one reason why known propagandists
they're talking about the the algorithm spreading falsehoods is one reason why
known propagandists like Alex Jones of info wars have managed to build wildly
successful channels on the back of conspiracy theories so again it's this
it's this attitude that they need to protect you from conspiracy theories
God forbid and in fact in this article they talk about things like the Bermuda
triangle it's not even political you can't even have people making fun
conspiracy videos about the Bermuda triangle without them slapping a fact
check on it like who even cares like slapping a fact check on big four or
something like that UFOs it's not even political and they say no we're even
gonna relegate that content how dare you even talk about it so again it's this
nannying idea that you have to be protected from conspiracy theory videos
on YouTube no some people want to watch that so if they want to search for it
they want to watch it that's what should come on most of these conspiracy videos
annoy the hell out of me too you know everything's a false flag everything
staged but if people want to watch that they should be allowed to watch it
without you nannying them and saying no you can't have that so we're literally
gonna change the algorithm and bury you beneath 20 stupid CNN videos which
aren't even related to the subject that you're searching about it's absolutely
ridiculous but it shows how desperate they are in trying to come back and
trying to compete with people who literally spend 10 15 years of their
lives at this point building a YouTube career building a YouTube personality
building the infrastructure of actual independent news organizations I'm not
even talking about in four walls I'm talking about you know people like
Philip DeFranco he's essentially his own independent news organization those are
the people that are gonna get punished by it and it's because they can't compete
it's because to be successful on YouTube you need to have a personality okay
but most people who work for the mainstream media do not have a
personality and it takes years and years to build a loyal audience that will
want to watch every single one of your videos that's how you build up an
audience that's how you go viral that's how you build up a huge subscriber base
mainstream media has no idea how to achieve that so now YouTube Google has
said oh we'll just give you 25 million dollars each we'll just boost you up
artificially we'll break the system and now will you be able to compete even
after this they probably will still fail because they're so utterly useless and
they don't know what they're doing when it comes to YouTube and they're just
gonna try and stand for everybody else we'll do by on the arts show show live

you're listening to the alex jones show
live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones
show and now your host all joseph Watson
we're back it is the fourth hour of the alex jones show now we're gonna delve
into this issue of the Sadiq Khan baby balloon of course the big news headlines
this week we're all about the donald trump baby balloon and in fact I'm
reading a headline here from spiked magazine who's the real baby here it
gets into who's behind this donald trump baby balloon it's a 24 baby balloon of
donald trump in a nappy which they plan to fight fly near the houses of
parliament when trump visits this week despite the fact that donald trump isn't
going anywhere near london because our conservative and name-only government is
so afraid of the protesters who might show up so basically they've got this
20-foot balloon ready to fly near the houses of parliament this is what it
says about it in the spiked magazine article who's the real baby here the
anti-trump stunt has been organized by environmental activist leo murray the
great grandson of labor politician anthony greenwood murray who rents out
two flats in a 1.8 million pound townhouse in hammersmith has written a
piece for the guardian explaining his reasons well of course he has and
basically it goes on to say that on the morning trump was elected this guy
cried oh boo hoo he cried his eyes out now he's gonna get his revenge by
launching this trump balloon near the houses of parliament goes on to basically
say that they are justifying this they're saying that the motive behind
this is because they're fighting back against the establishment so a project
initiated by a super rich member of a political family in london that lives in
a cushy townhouse in hammersmith two million pounds a project approved by the
mayor of london that's anti-establishment is it no it isn't that's
ridiculous it's another corbinista upper middle-class bourgeoisie pretending to
be anti-establishment pretending to be working class when they're not this is
what we see over and over again and now we have on the line yanny brouwer who is
the man behind the response to this which is the sedique corn baby balloon
which he intends to fly at some point over london over the next few weeks it
raised over 50,000 dollars now over 40,000 pounds in basically less than a
week and as I said earlier they raised more money in significantly less time
than the trump baby balloon with virtually zero media coverage an
absolutely fantastic effort they beat them they're still not getting the
recognition they deserve but yanny brouwer welcome to the show
cool thanks for having me Paul now first I just want to ask you about what
inspired you to start this project and going beyond just flying the balloon
what's the ultimate plan for this project yes I mean in the project I'm the
reason for doing this I mean was I was really annoyed at Khan's willingness to
to insult the most powerful man in the Western world Donald Trump you know as
a friend of Britain is half British himself and we need those kind of
friends after Brexit so I was really irritated by it and the fact that city
can't think that you can say that don't Trump isn't welcome or the president of
the United States a great ally of ours isn't welcome to London or to the UK on
our behalf when he's not elected to represent us it's it's really
frustrating and irritating so I wanted to address that the serious issue of free
speech as well and in a light-hearted way and I thought the best way to do that
would be a tip-for-tap move and see if city Khan is willing to have a giant
blimp of himself caricature of himself and commit his own insulting mockery in
the name of free speech and moving now I'm sorry yeah go ahead no I was gonna say
and and beyond this you know I think everyone's had enough of city kind in
terms of the crime and him try to talk on our behalf and like I said what's the
bigger reason behind it the bigger reason is to try and remove Khan's office is
clearly not fit to be mayor we've seen that with the soaring crime rates in
in London and his failure and unwillingness to address those serious
issues so correct me if I'm wrong but do you plan to have some kind of event I
don't know how much you want to get into this but you plan on having some kind of
event which draws attention to the massive violent crime problems we've
been having in London is that correct yes the idea is to synchronize the
baby Khan balloon blimp and have it airborne at this event the event will
be make London great make London safe again sorry and be some time in August
we're kind of working on the exact details of it but it'll be some time in
August and with the aim of trying to make London safe again and of course you
know London can't be safe with city Khan's man now let's talk about the
media attention because as I mentioned earlier you made more money in less time
than the Trump baby balloon despite the fact that they basically had a week or
more of sustained intense media coverage how interested has the mainstream
media been in your project yes we went live on Thursday today Tuesday so five
days we've made 40,000 I think the Trump balloon has made about 27,000 in over a
month so it has been quite astonishing really the mainstream media after
yourself you got involved and I had a couple of messages from from a few
people and yesterday and today it's picked up a little bit I'm on the
Victoria Derbyshire show tomorrow BBC son of contacted me I think I the eye
newspaper in the UK have done a piece but it's obviously nowhere near as much
as the baby Trump balloon so it was only after you start baking serious money and
getting this funded that they actually had to pay attention to it you've got
more money in three days than they got in 30 days absolutely monumental effort
but you know with this Trump visit we've had I've spoken to people people in
UKIP and others who've said you know they've tried to have Trump welcoming
street parties or celebrations not even protests they're being told no by the
police obviously the police have authorised these giant protests to take
place on Friday Karn Sadiq Karn has authorized that the blimp to go up on
Friday what do you what do you have approved a giant inflatable black
Barack Obama baby blimp flying over Poland this is a question and do has he
already approved your balloon or is that still in the works that's doing the
works and no of course you would have approved a baby Obama would he just
wouldn't have happened and I saw that today he was on the is it a great
morning Britain show or something with Pierce Morgan and Pierce Morgan asked
him he said you know if the if someone makes a baby blimp of you or you as a
pig caricature and would you be willing to fly and he said if it's a safe and
peaceful demonstration then yes so based on that you know I don't see any
reason why it won't go ahead and I think it's kind of pigeonholed himself a
little bit and in terms of his maneuvers now so he's basically backed
himself into a corner what exactly is this blimp gonna look like is it just
gonna be Sadiq in a in a nappy or you're gonna incorporate some kind of pig
design into it now that they've mentioned that it's currently with an
illustration artist and illustrator so we're gonna work on a couple of
different designs see what's best but you know it's got to capture the horrible
features of Sadiq you know the horrible hook nose the bags under the eyes and it's
gonna be pretty gruesome we'll see how triggered he gets because that was my
response when I first read about the Trump balloon you know a lot of people
on the right said oh this is a disgrace this is insulting the president
which it is but that's kind of not the reaction you have because then you get
called a snowflake they say you're triggered obviously that they're too
dim-witted to think up their own insults so they just use our insults
against us but your response is exactly right you take that and you turn it back
on them then you make him look like an absolute hypocrite if he doesn't
authorize this so I guess I'm guessing that was your response so the response
wasn't to get offended by the Trump baby blue it was to respond in the way you
did which was to use the exact same stunt against them right exactly yes I
thought okay if you want to play that game you know to play that game but
this time you're gonna have to prove yourself in having a big massive 30-foot
blimp of yourself flying over London and we'll see how nice that is see if
you're willing to submit yourself to the same public humiliation you are so
easily to Donald Trump now we're gonna come back after the break and talk more
about this talk about that the sheer hypocrisy and Khan having nothing to
say about you know the crown prince of Saudi Arabia visiting the Islamist
dictator Erdogan just want to read some stats though about London crime
under Sadiq Khan since he came to power as mayor knife attacks of sword by 21%
shooting incidents by 23% street robberies by 33% motorbike robberies by
50% and murders by 40% in February and March London had more murders it
exceeded the murder rate of New York this is a giant problem his previous
excuse was to say oh but we did a report about that last month and basically
it's getting worse and worse and worse the police are being given fewer and
fewer powers to actually chase these moped criminals for example they're
trying to turn it around right now simply because of the massive public
backlash but again these these figures seem to be getting worse and worse
that's what you're gonna be drawing attention to with these this city Khan
baby balloon and it's gonna be very intriguing how they're response to it
but we're gonna talk about it more after the break on the Alex Jones show live

you're listening to the alex jones show
news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host Paul joseph
watson we are back live and we're talking to yanni breuer about the sudic corn baby
inflatable balloon that he plans to fly over london next month we're talking
about the trump baby bloom which is set to fly over london this friday now just
looking at some of the recent visitors to london let's take a look at this
shortlist crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin salman this is a guy who's
presiding over war crimes in Yemen he's presiding over the persecution of gays
and women in Saudi Arabia who protested his visit to london barely anybody let's
look at the islamist dictator president Erdogan of turkey you know a guy who locks
up journalists a guy who tortures people a guy who has his own goons beat people
up in the united states who protested his visit barely anybody let's look at what's
happening in Iran women are literally being tortured and imprisoned for
removing their hijabs there was another famous case of that that happened this
week where are the feminists where are the marchers on the iranian embassies
they're not happening sudic corn said nothing about any of that nobody really
protested it oh but donald trump donald trump said grab them by the pussy 13
years ago and we're expecting 100,000 people out on the streets absolutely
absurd the level to which people allow themselves to be manipulated by fake
moral outrage fake hysteria you know yanny how many of these people are
going to be out protesting this weekend because they feel a genuine moral urge to
do so and how many of them are going to be doing it you know for an instagram
selfie because they're vapid virtue signaling morons yeah I mean I think with
anti-trump thing I think people are anti-trump to be anti-trump on it I
don't think there's any there's no real substance to any of it otherwise they'd
be out there you know campaign against like the people he just mentioned so a
lot of it is to do with popularity it's really popular it's really cool to be
anti-trump and if you're not anti-trump then you uncall and and basically you're
silenced and you can't say that you're pro-trump or anything so a lot of it's
just bullshit isn't it really it's exactly the word for it it's also
there's no Glastonbury this year so they can't old shout for Jeremy Corbyn so
they're probably missing that let me read you this quote from the Trump baby
balloon activist your arch nemesis he said well what could have been a day of
infamy for Britain he's talking about the visit of Trump instead becomes a day
of national pride and unity so he thinks he's literally gonna create national
pride and unity by flying this 20-foot Trump baby balloon
Yanni how much unity do you think those people would exhibit in that crowd if you
attended their protest wearing a red MAGA hat do you think they'd be very very
forgiving and very unifying in that situation no I'm sure it'd be the same
as being you know fed to a pack of wards if I was there wearing a make
America great again so it's it's all kind of double standard isn't it it's
completely double standards what they what they say they tolerate and and this
kind of thing they don't it's the complete opposite it's actually the
people on the who are more pro-trump on the right are the ones who are more
tolerant it's incredible also now this is not to advocate any legal activity
whatsoever we obviously don't do that but anybody who's been reading for channel
the past few days knows that they've located where this Trump baby balloon is
as with past 4chan events specifically with the child above and everything that
happened with him they're talking about bringing this inflatable balloon down do
you see that happening is usually you think that's on the horizon given how
much chatter there is on 4chan about it I haven't seen the chatter on 4chan
personally but it you know it would be good to see if it did come down it'd be
nice to see I'm not you know like I said advocating that but I think there's I
think people underestimate just how irritating at this event is just how
irritating this balloon is and people underestimate it and they think that
everyone's anti-trump in the UK and it's not the case it's just not the case
so you could want to come down you could see you know counter protest of some
sort but these people are so blinded but you know these people in London these
pro-trump anti-trump sorry they're so blinded by themselves they don't see
anything else I don't see that there is actually support for Donald Trump in the
UK yeah I mean it's really annoying when they claim to speak for everyone in the
UK by being so intolerant of his visit while claiming that they're the
tolerant ones I mean you had France France basically got a jump on us again
the population of France I imagine are no great fans of Donald Trump in any in
any large majority it's probably the same as in the UK but they got a jump on
everyone they arranged a I think it was a state visit or the equivalent of before
anyone else there were no giant protests obviously a few no giant protests it
worked out well for both countries you know they could get over their little
but hurt and just acknowledge the fact that even if you don't like the
president you have to respect the office and to ostracize the president
that's only going to harm our interests as he said when we need this Brexit deal
if even you know Brexit happens at all at this point but just in closing
Yanny tell people how they can support the funding and the organization of this
Sadiq Khan baby balloon event yeah so it's there on crowdfunding we've got until
the 9th of August so we've been going five days we've got 40,000 pounds and so
it's a long way to go 9th of August for the funding so the bigger the donations
the bigger the amount we raise the bigger the balloon the bigger the event the
more we can do on the day to help make London safe again and if you want to get
involved you can contact myself on Twitter or there'll be a few other
details as well in the next coming days of who else to contact in regards to that
but yeah keep the money coming in and then you know the more we raise the
bigger this event can be and the more pressure we can put on Sadiq Khan
definitely so people got a few weeks to keep that money rolling in you can stage
a bigger and bigger event the more money you get and basically have a real
response to these people who claim to represent those in the UK they don't
you've proven that by out raising them in a matter of days it's a come a month
to make what 27,000 pounds you made that in almost in just over three days
absolutely monumental effort that the real the real fight back begins we will
have our voice just as they have theirs and we'll continue to monitor it Yanni
Brewer thanks for joining us today. Thanks for having me. There goes Yanni Brewer with
the Sadiq Khan baby balloon protest be sure to go and find that and donate it

Trump visit this is a headline out of zero hedge Americans in UK urged to keep
low profile during Trump visit so our conservative and name only government is
so petrified of what might happen from these virtue signaling lefty
Corbyn Easter middle-class idiots that all live in two million pound plush pads
in West London that they're now telling Americans living in London or Americans
visiting London to keep a low profile during President Trump's visit later
this week following the NATO summit says numerous this is a warning this is the
fish official warning from the US Embassy in London numerous demonstrations
are being planned for July 12 to 14 surrounding the visit and visit of the
president the United States Trump will hold talks with Theresa May and again
he's not even going to be anywhere near London but they're telling Americans in
London to be visible to keep a low profile because protest may turn violent
they're literally telling people to keep a low profile just American tourists
Americans living in London why would they need to do that is that they're
telling them not to wear red MAGA hats is that it do we not want to trigger the
tolerant liberals at this point is that what they're afraid of against
absolute cowardly behavior from front to back with this government right now
which is betrayed brexit and on that subject bright bar headline Trump backs
Boris Johnson's brexit rebellion President Trump has bought petrol into
the flames of UK Prime Minister Theresa May's brexit crisis by coming out for
her chief opponent Boris Johnson so he gave these comments early today said
Boris Johnson's a friend of mine he's been very very nice to me very supportive
of course Trump sees his own legacy as being deeply embedded in the brexit
vote which happened what about five months before he became president or at
least was elected president so Trump sees his legacy in the legacy of brexit he
wants to keep brexit alive brexit has been completely betrayed by our
conservative and name only government over the past few days even with all
these resignations it looks like Theresa May is going to keep her job the
remainers in parliament are dancing a jig they're over the moon with this crappy
deal which isn't brexit at all really we're facing dark times in the UK is the
UK at the point of no longer being a functioning democracy given that they're
basically ignoring the results of a national referendum harrowing times
