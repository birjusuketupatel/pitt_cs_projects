We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
It's Alex Jones, and it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't
know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe,
you got one!
Well ladies and gentlemen, I told you it was coming and now the beast has reared its head
directly.
Georgetown University, headquarters of the globalist takeover of the State Department
and the CIA, the deepest of the deep state, even worse than Harvard or Yale.
That's where Carol Quigley trained William Jefferson Clinton for the Central Intelligence
Agency role of president.
That's all declassified.
Georgetown University has sued Info Wars and has sued former Congress for now in West
and many others, our own Leanne McAdoo, for pointing out that just like what happened
in Florida with the Parkland tragedy, out of 3,000 students they chose four who were
anti-gun whose parents were connected to the Democratic Party to be the spokesperson.
They then spun that, that we said nobody died or they were crisis actors.
It's the same thing here.
We pointed out that people that had worked at the State Department and CIA connected
offices and then had worked for Congressmen, funded openly, massively by George Soros and
who had worked for Hillary Clinton directly, were the spokesperson's out there putting
out a narrative.
In the suit it says, and in the Georgetown editorial put out by the university law school,
it says all the same lies that I said it's crisis actors, it's all fake.
This is the defamation.
I am being defamed by a deep state institution and one of its alumni who worked for the State
Department, Hillary Clinton, is the individual claiming that us questioning all this and
pointing out they put this narrative out of a martyr when the poor woman got killed
to create this clash in the media trying to mainline anti-fuzz a good organization and
that narrative blew up in their face.
And so they don't want us here.
They don't want us on air.
They don't want us to question.
They even put in the lawsuit that we exposed the Comey 2012 hoax and said that that was
a CIA run.
That came out in the news later.
I have friends who were CIA contractors on the ground.
You guys opened up a big fat can of worms on this.
They're saying I need to be taken off the air along with scores of other websites and
news organizations preemptively.
This is to set the precedent that they define at Georgetown what's real news and what isn't
this isn't a defamation suit.
It is sold in a giant PR operation put out in press releases by Georgetown and the Dean
of the law school calling for us to be shut down and then Sadiq Khan, the Islamist mayor
of London, who has police stand down and anti-fuzz beat up men, women and children, he was in
Austin yesterday and called for web censorship of conservatives to be taken off the web.
Looks like they've done in Europe by claiming it's white supremacist.
It's on, folks.
There's the headline, London mayor Sadiq Khan tells Silicon Valley to censor hate speech.
They're mainlining their takeover.
So this is the fight that's targeting your speech.
I am quite frankly super honored because when I read the suit and saw that, by the way,
the suits saying I'm saying the CIA was connected to PR, which they are on record.
And now basically this is the deep state heart of the CIA left his arm suing me.
In full wars life is launching its newest product.
We're really, really proud of it.
It's a best source prebiotic fiber and it's got the very best concentrated fibers from
berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your

Michael ZX that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these
other products.
You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality
products at the same time.

concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.

By an ear SJW globalist George Soros dropping stabilize
Hillary Clinton the new order and Michael Moore go back to baby
We're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma. You got that you think there was
Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot make it up you cannot make it up Georgetown University
Quarterbacks the actual control of the National Security Act and the globalist takeover of America Carol quickly the head of their political science department
wrote an 1100 page book in the mid 1960s for the CIA and State Department even understand the algorithm and
Philosophy they were using of authoritarianism and false left-right paradigm control
They have now had a former
State Department individual assigned to the Foreign Service and working under Hillary
Sue myself Allen West and many others and we've had Georgetown University law
file the suit
so this is using
taxpayer-funded money
To engage in a anti-free speech crusade
To set a precedent as I've been warning you to ban info wars and then everybody else
So that they can preemptively have government say what's real news and what is fake news and that's what the suit calls for it
Is incredible. So this is the Democrat arm of the deep state
Georgetown suing me and what's incredible here is that
They're saying that we say this guy's Hillary and Soros connected and that it looks like a classic CIA cutout where he worked
And he's combat zones in Africa for the State Department because the State Department runs the CIA not the other way around and
We had guest on that pointed that out. We're being sued for questioning
And then there is CIA connections to some of the other people and so they conflate it us covering
Ukraine and stuff in the videos in the lawsuit and mix Ukraine in with Charlottesville
We're talking about Soros funding that which he's on record on Fareed Sarkaria saying it on singing in
And they do stuff like in the lawsuit cut words off where I say Soros needs to go to jail for
Staging Charlottesville they cut the word chaos off
And they see
So they go look he says Soros staged it all
No, nobody was killed crisis actors when I said the Democrats do hire actors to be the core of
Some of these astroturf events like Michael Moore showing up to the event
Reverend Trump got elected that was funded by Russian bots turns out more didn't even know he was going to something funded by Russian bots
It was anti-Trump
So you got government she had corporations this goes on Hillary stage fake town halls
That's on record CNN's been caught she has been caught with the babies of the incubators and you know Congress all those fake reports
To get us in the Iraq war. So the first Iraq war. So we have a right to question
And they don't like us questioning their narratives. This is incredible and
We're gonna go over some of the lawsuit today
Our lawyers have looked at the pep in the frog lawsuit. They said yeah, the guy told everybody in public interviews to use the image
Plus, it's not even your art. You're selling. It was a third-party posters you sold. This is we have absolute slapback total victory
It's just open and shut and
It's we got two other lawsuits dismissed this week and I'm talking to lawyers about whether I'm gonna show that
Two of them dismissed with prejudice by the judge
These are suits. I did the lawyers didn't even want me to get into now
This is was agreement. So I didn't sue them once their lawyers though once they got competent counsel
They went who got you to do this? They went well
You know the Democrats and some of these Democrats are so crazy
They tell me you better watch it and shut up more suits are coming and they're dumb enough to do it in emails
I mean folks the Democrats are
crazy
They're nuts. They want Trump out. They want the power. They want to put their boot back on America's neck and they are pissed
And that's why they're freaking out because we're getting all these lawsuits
I mean it was up to actually it's 11 now, but we've gotten six dismissed to just this week. I
Mean we're like grand slamming them out of the park every time because they're crazy and just because
The Washington Post the New York Times and all everybody misquotes what we said about this guy
Who did videotape the stuff and who I don't think was part of staging anything? He's a spokesperson of the Democrats
He loves Hillary. He's a leftist. He went all over TV. He was a public figure before he's a public figure after he's gonna be all over
the news channels as a cause celeb
Democratic fundraising he writes articles for Politico how I became fake news Brennan Gilmore
And Alexander Jones in four Wars is the top of the bill. I like that. It's like it's like John Hancock
My name right there big and bold baby. That's the new declaration of dependence right there
You got Lee Stray and a hammy to get him on today, let's go back. I'll read it Lee Ann McAdoo and then they've got some other news organizations
They're suing
So this guy goes out and writes his articles misrepresents what I said about Charlottesville defames me
Then George Town law
As deep state as it gets
Comes out and then they have the nerve to say we're suing you because you say I might be connected to the CIA
Are you joking? I mean, you don't think the public doesn't know or Colonel Allen West of the army
Doesn't know what the State Department is the State Department is the CIA. It runs it
It is the deepest state
Ridiculous
asinine
That's why Pompeo just got promoted to the number two spot in the government more important than the vice president when it comes to what he's
Doing and then they brought in another lady
This has been very loyal of the country under that they talk about oh left says she ran black sites and torture and I'm not for torture
Trump was kind of honest about it because he does go on everybody does it and
The point is is that folks have asked me what I think about it and
You
Never know what really went on because it's the globalists that are here's pointing their finger at her and
Saying you know in Thailand there was some black site with al Qaeda terrorist in it and
You know did she destroy evidence? I mean that's that's the New York Times saying she did that
And you know, I tend to know that stuff goes on so I tend to believe it
But not because the New York Times wrote it the point is it's the first female director of the central intelligence agency
And the first female director it's so crazy of any of these big agencies
Oh, but you can hardly even find that in the news instead. It's new CIA director Gina Haspel
Had leading role in torture
Well Obama said he's really good at killing people oh and Obama said he stopped the torture
Let me give you a little newsflash under Obama the torture exploded and they put ISIS and al Qaeda in charge to gang rape and murder all over the
World so that's coming up, but the big news teller sent out. Why is he out?
Let's get Roger Stone on I forgot to tell you that he's been saying teller since out since
Last December. He said it's imminent imminent imminent and teller sent is out
We're gonna look at Pompeo
Let's get Steve Pachinic on as well former head of psychological operations the State Department
That means former head of CIA psychological operations
It's like a joke. Oh, how dare you say I'm connected to CIA. I just worked in clandestine offices of the State Department in Africa
Oh, oh, of course. Oh my goodness. Excuse me wait till we explain that to a jury if it ever gets to him
And then then there is the rules of evidence
the optional completeness
Jury's gonna have to watch whole four-hour shows or every clip you want to show them and guess who after they watch the broadcast

You're listening to the Alex Jones show
When I grow up, I want to be a rock star
When I grow up, I want the deep state to sue me
So I can draw them out in the open
So I can get them in those deposition rooms
And hammer those white shoe boys to the return of the republic
We now take you live to the rebirth of America and the second revolution
Hey!
Yeah! I can feel the spirit
We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
In the heart of the Resistance
You're listening to Alex Jones
My name, my children, my treasure, my soul
Is on the line to defeat these parasite globalists
And I'm feeling good
You want to know their number
If you want to know their kryptonite
If you want to know what they fear, it's infowars
It's you, it's Americana
It's God-fearing people of every race, color and creed
Who bleed red blood
Now, I'll get more into the deepest of the deep state
Clinton Command Base, CIA, leftist faction, Jesuit, globalist, Vatican, El Supremo
Operation
And again, I'm not anti-catholic
I'm anti-leftist globalists that are taking control of the Catholic Church
With this new pope, 100% St. China and Communisms
The model of Christianity
I mean, I heard 30, 40 years ago
Preachers saying there'll be a pope that calls for Communism
In one world, religion, I'd roll my eyes
You know, remember the popes before that were bringing down Communism and stuff
And now he's there pushing it
I mean, this is a takeover
And Georgetown is the Jesuit Command Base
And it is more important than Harvard and Yale
When it comes to the State Department
It is what runs that, basically
And to have Georgetown law put out an editorial
Just like you'll have an endorsement or a non-endorsement of a candidate
There's no name on it
That means it's the dean
And then this whole thing about how I don't deserve speech
And I need to be silenced
It sounds like something Mao Zedong would write
That's coming up
But it was the Jesuits and the whole leftist arm that helped put Mao into power
God Almighty, that's all
It's all on record, it's just incredible
The Society of Jesus is now the society of the globalists and the Communist Party
And they're making their move
Like I was told by high-level CIA sources that I was going to have Catholics at action
Take a big move at me in the next month
And boy, here it is, a direct, direct frontal attack
So I guess everything's full circle
Because it was my, I don't know, I say ninth generation
But I'm an eighth generation Texas, my children are ninth generation
Came into Texas in the early 1820s, it was a Mexican land grant
And a lot of my family was from Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia
But on my mom's side, it was the heirs and the Greshams and all those folks
Were successful, very successful rich folks in New York
Strangely enough, they sold us some of the slaughterhouses and stuff
That later the Rockefellers got that the U.N. buildings owned on
My family once owned that property on that side
He sold everything he had and bought a shipload of Bibles
Back then, a Bible cost the equivalent of thousands of dollars a day
Of King James Version Bibles
And they had a big shootout with the Jesuits in Galveston
But they got the Bibles through
And they were directly working with President Andrew Jackson
At the time to quarterback a plan to overthrow this sector
And bring the Republicans
So it's just strange how things revolve
My ancestors working with the President Jackson
Trump fashions himself after Jackson and I'm working with Trump again
Yes, history repeats, ladies and gentlemen
It's magic, it's real
I am those ancestors
And, you know, Trump's got a great lineage of German and is Scott like Jackson
And here we are, it's on, ladies and gentlemen
Trump's not perfect, but he's trying to be the President
And Tillerson has been removed
Tillerson has been a double dealer
Trump's assistant has also been let go and a bunch of other people
He had Pompeo, legally and lawfully, because they are agents of globalists
Looking into folks at the White House
And we're now into year number two
And Trump knows who's loyal and Trump knows who isn't
And so let me just say we're going to give you as good as you give us
So enjoy yourselves, everyone
Because Trump has just decided to take full command of the White House
And it's on
We're going to play some of Trump coming up in the next segment
I've got a ton of clips to get to here, but let me tell you something
We got calls days ago
They were trying to bully Leanne McAdoo and telling her they were going to sue her
And all this stuff, they've really tried to pressure her
And do a lot of things to her in the last few years to get her to make stuff up about this operation
And she's just such a good person, she never did it
And her grandmother had a brain tumor and she's been taking care of her
But still been working and she's here right now
And it just so happened that she comes about three or four times a year from Florida
And she was just here when all this came down
And they really put the drill bits to her
She just had Lee Stranahan on who teaches a journalism school
And never said anything, he just said
Look how they picked people who were Democrat connected to sit there and parrot talking points all over the news
And you know, it says that in this lawsuit, it says
From Vegas to Parkland, Florida, you know, Joan says nobody died in this whole thing
That's not true
The lawsuit itself is a defamatory screed of propaganda
And that's what, you understand, we got two lawsuits dismissed this week
And I'm allowed to reveal the stuff, but the lawyers are still looking at whether I should
We got to send a letter to the fury guy with the frog
Because we had to do that before we sue them and they just, it's open and shut
And my lawyers don't tell me that unless it is
I mean, it's anti-slapback provision, open and shut
The problem is this is going to take money
But now they've got a taxpayer funded university
Suing trying to end the free speech and you've got Sadiq Khan yesterday at UT, we were going to go cover that
Or South by Southwest down by UT
The London stand mayor who wants to get rid of free speech who lets Antifa beat people up
Who's banning images of women in bathing suits, he's bringing Sharia law in
And the guy is a nightmare
And he says get rid of free speech calling it hate speech
London Mayor Sadiq Khan tells Silicon Valley to censor hate speech
And that means us, they're coming for the First Amendment, it's here
Let's play that clip
The handful of the largest global tech companies have managed to amass an enormous amount of power over how information is consumed
In some cases, these new platforms have been used to exacerbate, fuel and deepen the divisions within our communities
We've already seen evidence of elections and referendums been influenced
A rise in online abuse, misogyny and religious hatred
Fake news spreading misinformation
Algorithms blinkering us from different points of view and pushing people to extremes
And terrorists and far-right groups using social media to not only conspire but to radicalize and brainwash others
Everything you said is back on him, he literally protects no numbers of ISIS in Al Qaeda and lets them come back to the country and attack people
He is a monster and of course Twitter, Facebook and Google work with Pakistan to arrest blasphemers and have them executed
So that's what you know

For sure, I'm taking a shooter
It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons
Claire, or what do you think?
Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the front lines of the information war and the attempt to restore our republic and take back power from the offshore tax-exempt megabanks
You can see they're fighting very hard to cause civil unrest, to push racial division all over the news, to push cop killing and then they've got the foreign Islamic mayor of London stand
who's banning nationalist free speech, arresting people in mass, only Muslims are allowed to speak at speakers' corner basically and call for killing everybody, bringing Islamists back into the nation
We've got all of this unfolding and going on and then Georgetown University sues me and puts out an official paper calling for us to be taken off the air
Total defamation, they lie, they say that we say crisis actors, you know we're in Florida and nobody died, the same thing for Vegas and all of it and just none of it's true
The defamation is the lawsuit to then have the media sit out there and push it and they're suing Congressman Allen West, they're suing Lee Ann McAdoo, they're suing a bunch of other folks
Virginia man sues info wars, let's go back to the hill, others for fake news at the Charlottesville rally, oh where is the headline?
Georgetown University uses taxpayer money to sue to push for the end of the free press, wow that's pretty sensational isn't it?
Shadiq Khan calls for ending web freedom and free speech in the US, I mean that's the headline, calls for web censorship of conservatives labeling it hate speech
Defendants of the case, Alex Jones, reporters, Lee Stranahan, they put that in quotes because only mainstreamish, Lee Ann McAdoo, Jim Hoft, author of the alt-right blog Gateway Pundit
Oh it's a blog, it doesn't get hundreds of millions of views every week, former US congressman Allen B. West who operates the alt-right website, Allen, and notice Hillary created the name alt-right and that's who we are, see?
That means you're racist, a white supremacist, a black guy, no I'm the new right or I'm a libertarian, but again they dehumanize you, they label you
Derek Wilburne, author of the famatory article about Gilmore on allenwest.com and Scott Crichton, operator of the blog American Every Man
So, you read it and all people were like wow how are you handling it man, all these lawsuits
We had two lawsuits dismissed, one this week and one last week, I said two this week, it's brought to my attention a meeting like oh by the way there's some good news, dismissed with prejudice
That means you can't come back and file it and that's when they figured out we could sue them and their lawyers went actually, your other lawyers really screwed up, this is crazy
Two of them and the same thing with the frog, they said they've never seen a more fraudulent filing
Slapback provisions 100% and the letters being sent today to Mr. Fury, they think we're all dumb, I guess globalists go to the shopping mall and see zombies and think we're all like that
And it's their arrogance that blinds them, it's their arrogance that will bring them down because I've never seen anything like it
So again, this show, they want to distract us from the news, they want to distract us from all the things we're doing with these lawsuits but it is the news
They're trying to end free speech in America, they're trying to destroy talk radio, they're trying to destroy the churches in this country
Under Obama, more than 10,000 churches got sued by the Justice Department and the IRS saying that conservatives and Christian groups couldn't even be anti-abortion because that was political
And Trump has put forward his act to restore religious freedom in this country and the IRS has been forced to back off
The IRS wouldn't even issue 501c3s to libertarian, conservative or veterans groups, they wouldn't issue them to groups getting prosthetic legs for people who had their legs blown off
But the left issued, what was it, 50 plus thousand just in that one year of the debate, remember a few years ago, like four years ago when that was really heated up in Congress
It was 50 something thousand, one year to leftist groups where they don't have to pay any taxes for all their anti-American crap
Soros has all his tax-free foundations, by the way
Again, they're misrepresenting saying that I said all of Charlottesville was staged by Soros, I said chaos
That he added to funding Antifa, which is in the federal filings and in the news and on record and I have articles right here
But they misrepresent and then try to defame us saying that we say the guy that's suing us somehow carried out the attacks
No, we're saying he's a Democratic Party operative, worked for Hillary Clinton at the State Department, was out there and then used because of his political views to be put all over the news
But I'll say this, CNN and others called for a YouTube channel to be shut down and almost did and misrepresent what we said and I said hey you're supposed to sue me to prove something
So at least they're going the route, I'm not going, Alex bullied me, I'm a full grown man, take down his sites banning from the air
They're at least having Georgetown University, the most leftist globalist arm of the CIA, Jesuit University, I mean this is the Jesuits with taxpayer money trying to end free speech in America
Wow, you think they're going to be some amicus briefs to this, you think some folks are going to weigh it in, this is going to be a Titan battle
And I guess they think they got everything worked out there in Virginia with things, huh, so we can't red pill a jury
Yeah, this is a very sophisticated operation, but the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray
Think about it, they are attempting in this lawsuit and in their public statements to defame all of us that they've been named to lie about what we said to misrepresent to then rob you of the First Amendment and that's what they're calling for
Read the press releases, but you see them everywhere going do more to ban hate starting with Alex Jones and what do all the internal videos at Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube say
What's your main enemy, what do you try to stop Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson and anyone else like them
And so all these cowards, you see me listeners have their own big YouTube, they go well I'm just going to join this and attack Alex Jones so I can get promoted on YouTube
Promoted to a bunch of zombies because the folks that actually dial into what you're saying can't rub two brain cells together
I mean, this is the big assault on everything now let me say this
We ended the biggest special in our history because we were selling out of so many of those items but we've kept some of them at 50% off but we have been sold out as you know for months of Myco ZX
We now have Myco ZX plus it is stronger and it costs less because we've upscaled our orders and signed purchase orders out for a year and a lot of things so Myco ZX used to be $70 regular $50 when it was discounted and it was less strong

Myco ZX plus from M4's Life is 50% off out of the gates $27

The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle
It's a guy named Alex Jones
Alex Jones
From Infowars
From Infowars
Yeah, Alex Jones
Alex Jones
It's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11
I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true
Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs
The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition
She just had to keep digging, didn't she, Alex?
I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true
Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign, but changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count stories that's supporting the website Infowars
And this really just is so disgusting
The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones
It goes right from Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth
Hillary Clinton created ISIS with Obama
The very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign
If Trump gets elected, he's going to be Secretary of Defense
I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic
Move, bitch! Get out of the way!
Bill Clinton is a rapist at Infowars.com
Bill Clinton is a rapist!
Bill Clinton is a rapist at Infowars.com
Infowars.com
Bill Clinton is a rapist
The New World Order sends its regards
If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
It's Alex Jones
I am so honored to be sued by Pope Francis using U.S. taxpayer money
No, I'm not kidding. Pull up the Washington Post
Georgetown was founded as a private university in the 1790s
There, where Washington D.C. basically is today
And it was set up by the Vatican
But since about 100 years ago, it's been mainly funded by taxpayer money
So how Georgetown law gets Uncle Sam to pay its students bills
And they also are getting hundreds of millions of dollars now
When Obama cliently signed the countering disinformation
Then Propaganda Act to be run by the CIA and Georgetown
As well as the Board of Governors of the FCC
And so they've decided to try to shut us down
The Vatican has filed suit on us
Pope Francis, that's who runs Georgetown
Has green-lighted
He's been calling for shutting down fake news just a month ago
The Vatican has listed us as fake news
And so a foreign state based in the city of Rome
Is now actively suing me
Because I claim that a state department official
Who worked for Hillary Clinton
And who worked for a congressman funded by George Soros
Because I claim that he should be investigated for CIA ties
And then now the main leftist Jesuit globalist arm of the CIA
Has sued me and Congressman Allen West and others
Because they think you're so stupid
Police train a hand that runs a journalism school
Will be joining us
He's being sued and we were viewed last night
I was up until 1030
We were viewed all the videos they're suing us over
And there's nothing there
But in the lawsuit and then in the Georgetown defamation article
They put out against us
The taxpayer funded defamation against the citizen
Fenced through the Vatican
They called for us all to be shut down
And just banned out of hand
Sending the precedent
This is huge ladies and gentlemen
So think about that
They say oh a private citizen in Virginia
Suze Alex Jones for saying that he staged the events at Charlotte
We didn't say that
They cut off the end where we said
George Soros should be indicted for staging the chaos
Funding Antifa
I have a stack of articles where he pays for full page antifa ads
In the New York Times saying overthrow the government
We have all the statements here
I've got a big stack of articles
Assange warned CIA officers flooding into Democratic Party
For 2018 midterms
Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law
From the George Soros group run by his son Alexander
Friends of democracy
And the media never covered these documents
Never refuted them
How they hired the people
How the police stand down
How they do the riots in blue cities
You're wondering why they do it in blue cities
It's all there
Boy you think they're going to want me to put this in front of the jury
Jones is
See I'm being sued by a coalition of the corrupt pope
And George Soros
I noticed three of the articles they listed in the suit
Call George Soros a Nazi collaborator
They are so angry about that
They're letting me know what they're like
Shut up
No, I'm going to shut up
Ever
Never
Ever
And we're drawing your fire
This is exactly what I was planning
See I'm not like you
I'm not trying to keep myself safe
I'm not trying to just amass more money
I'm trying to defeat very dangerous bad people
Like George Soros, Hillary Clinton
Not the guy that's suing me
And in their lawsuit it's misrepresented
I have been defamed by the things that are said here
And they go out and they find these folks
And he's a public figure
And he goes on TV and he writes articles
And he says things about me that I didn't say about him
That's Brennan Gilmore
And then he'll be the costeleb all over the place
He's a portal Foreign Service Officer
With the State Department
How dare I say it should be looked into
Any CIA connections
The State Department runs the CIA
The main university the CIA recruits out of
Is Georgetown and then taxpayer money
With a Vatican run institution
The former head of the Jesuits
Now the Pope saying shut down Alex Jones
Shut down the free press
How sensational
And I had all these newspapers calling me today
And I called a few back and I just said
Will you please report on how they filed
12 lawsuits on a count of it's 12
We've got now I guess six or seven
I was saying 10 earlier
Dismissed two in the last eight, nine days
Because the courts just look at it
They're like what in the world is this
But they don't care it's that image
Band fake news, band fake news
Jones is being sued, Jones is being sued
Jones is being sued
They go to the big tech companies
And the big tech giants
The big social media outlets
Like Siddy Com, the Islamic mayor here in Austin
Saying shut down the American right
Band them from the web completely
Like China's done
We played the clip earlier
He's shutting down free speech in London
The globalists have brought in the Muslims
To carry this out
They're working with them
Facebook and Twitter have worked with Pakistan
To find out Christians and atheists
And people that blaspheme by saying
They don't believe in Muhammad
To help them be executed
Oh but he talked about misogyny
Yes let's go to the Muslim Sharia law man
He'll teach us how to take care of women
Now I want to go through all the other news
Because they're trying to distract us
With this and take our energy
But I realize to go with it
Like a judo move
And I've seen every time
We come through this and win
You understand we've gotten already
Five or six
We're right at half the fake lawsuits
Dismissed
And we're doing it very judiciously
But these are the big ones though
This is going to take money to fight these guys
And that's all I'm saying to the listeners and viewers
Is that
Just like the new CEO of News Corp
And bought by Disney said a month ago
They said we're going to start banning
Alan Jones and WikiLeaks
And then we're going to ban everybody else
He actually said we met with the big telecoms
We met with the big internet companies
The tech titans and this is the plan
And then they're just bringing it in
Lawsuits, taxpayer funded
It's all here, it's happening
And I am so honored to be in the middle of this
And to see Trump moving to get rid of the globalists
To get rid of the neocons
And really bringing this country back
It's a very, very magic time to be alive
Before we go any further
Because I hardly ever plug
We need to plug more
I barely plugged the 30 seconds last segment

They use their media to assassinate real news
They use their schools to teach children
That their president is another Hitler
They use their movie stars and singers
And comedy shows and award shows
To repeat their narrative over and over again
And then they use their ex-president
To endorse the resistance
All to make them march, make them protest
Make them scream racism and sexism
And xenophobia and homophobia
To smash windows, burn cars, shut down
Interstates and airports, bully and terrorize
The law abiding until the only option left
Is for the police to do their jobs
And stop the madness
And when that happens
They'll use it as an excuse for their outrage
The only way we stop this
The only way we save our country
And our freedom is to fight this violence
Of lies with the clenched fist of proof
I'm the National Rifle Association of America

It's Alex Jones
Well, the taxpayer-funded so-called Private University
Georgetown Law filed suit on me today
And they put up a great deal of money
And they put up a great deal of money
And they put up a great deal of money
And they put up a great deal of money
And they put up a great deal of money
And they filed suit on me today
And they put out press releases this morning
They were secretly talking to Reuters and AP
And they had Reuters and AP calling us
Trying to ask us questions
But not tell us there was a lawsuit
Incredible malfeasance by the so-called journalist
All working in concert
And I think there's a lot of evidence pointing towards it
Being an operation mockingbird
I mean, look at Georgetown
But it's key for everybody to understand
West being sued, myself, you name it
They say in the lawsuit, they say in their press releases
That we need to be banned off the internet because we're fake
And that they designate us as fake
That is the globalist pope that controls
That Jesuit University with taxpayer money
You can't make that up
And so this needs to be congressional hearings about this
This is the real move on the First Amendment
Now, Brittany Pettibone is a, I'd call her new right
They call her alt-right, that's a Hillary Clinton term
More of a nationalist populist
I'm familiar with her work
You know, they call her a Nazi
They call me a Nazi
It's just something they do
We're short sorrows as a real Nazi collaborator
But she and her boyfriend got detained for three days
So did Laura Southern, she got detained
And they basically got put in a prison
And told, wash your mouth while you're in there
And the media's all celebrating it
Now, Siddiq Khan is here at South by Southwest
At London Stand Mayor
He says that he wants the telecoms and big tech
Silicon Valley to shut down all conservatives free speech
Because he's God, he defines it, just like Georgetown
So this is all interconnected
And so just like I'm talking about Pettibone
I know when she goes on the shows
I'm giving her my little two cents
We're going to break here in a moment
I'm going to go to her now
That we need to talk about the big picture
Because this is happening everywhere
This is an Obama executive order that was signed
That I covered earlier
Dealing with his Ministry of Truth
And this is an incredible time to be alive
But this is all an orchestrated event
It's getting really, really intense
And it just shows they're that desperate
To attempt a massive communist Chinese style
Because that's what they're modeling it after
Crackdown
And it's getting so bad if police chiefs mention
That 90-plus percent of the rapes are by Muslim men
You know, they get fired
So Brittany, congratulations on your courage
I know you were trying to go
Give a speech at Speaker's Corner with your boyfriend
For hundreds of years they've had free speech
But I guess only the Islamists are allowed to speak now
In the UK about two weeks ago
And I got in no problem
And I was at Speaker's Corner
So I was able to see for myself
That it's about like 90 percent Muslims
That go there now
But actually my boyfriend was the one
Who was going to give the speech at Speaker's Corner
I was going to go and cover it
But the main reason that I was denied entry
Was because I wanted to interview Tommy Robin
Who they declared a far-right leader
And someone who incites racial hatred
So it was kind of, you know, a mixture of reasons
But they were trying to get us both on different things
Because they couldn't say that, oh, you can't go in
Just because you're going to watch a speech
You know, it wasn't a good enough reason
That's right
And of course that's in the news
They admit that, and you've got the paperwork as well
We've written articles about it
It's on Tommy Robinson's website
Where is it best for people to go check out your sites
To actually see the proof for themselves?
Well, I actually just posted a video on my YouTube channel
That I made with my boyfriend Martin yesterday
My YouTube channel is Britney Pettybone
I've also put out some tweets regarding it
Because people are now accusing us of forging these documents
But I mean, I have them all here
I also have documents from the detention facility
Proving that we were there
And we actually got ID cards
Which they confiscated, but Martin snuck his out
So we have his ID card proving that we were at this time
Well, they always do this
It's like when CNN called for us to be banned
Later, they said it was all made up
This is how they have to stain for their viewers and listeners
They've banned Michael Savage from going to England
I've been interrogated when I go in about what I'm going to say and do
And they had police actually in MI5 come to my hotel on record
Expanding on that
They want, Siddy Kahn wants Donald Trump banned from London
But then they try to say they're not doing this
Yeah, it's absolutely crazy
And yet they'll let in returning ISIS fighters
They'll let in all these illegals
We'll slip through the cracks
But then when it comes to people with political opinions
Who they don't necessarily agree with
Suddenly the border force is just the most competent one in the entire world
Oh, absolutely
It was London Stan, it is the command base for ISIS worldwide
We'll be right back
After years of research working with top developers here in the United States
With the latest cutting-edge science
We are rolling out three new digestive gut aids
One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme
Carnivore for being able to break down meat and other proteins better
And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture
Of the very best strains in fluorolive advanced restoration
And we also have an everyday extremely affordable fluorolive everyday maintenance
But all of these are the very cutting-edge top-of-the-line probiotics
And digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price
That is my goal here
Is to bring you the very best at the lowest price
When you purchase it at m4store.com
You know you are also financing the attack on the globalist
And the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide
Waging war on corruption
It's Alex Jones coming to you live
On the front lines of the Info War
Yellow song on the loose
Sirens in my head
Well, Brittany Pettibone has hundreds of millions of views on her YouTube
She's a great journalist
I'd call her a libertarian, nationalist, constitutionalist
But they call her a Nazi
Of course George Soros is the one that runs that
He's a real Nazi collaborator
But her and her boyfriend were trying to fly into London
Where they'd been many times to interview Tommy Robinson, the great patriot
And they got detained for three days in a prison cell
And it was even in the British news
You can just type it into a search engine
Brittany Pettibone and others at Laura Southern detained
And the police admitted that
But now the spend machine is it looks really scary and bad to have these folks with no criminal record
Not allowed to come in
But Paul Watson's got a viral video out right now
Let's put it up on screen if we can
Where they admit that they let thousands of jihad fighters in who tell them
I'm gonna kill people
They go, oh, we want you for sure
It's like they have in Sweden these rehabilitation centers for ISIS and al-Qaeda fighters
It's amazing because this is who they're gonna displace everybody with
So it's the truth about broken Britain
Everybody needs to see it
It's very, very powerful
I'm gonna play it later in the hour
It's on infowars.com
So you have Sadiq Khan here in Austin
It's out by Southwest saying ban all conservatives offline
You have the Globalist Center
You can use communist Chinese style net censorship with a new Web ID to enforce that
You've got Georgetown University taxpayer funded at the law department
They say they're private
They're not put the Washington Post up please
So taxpayer money suing me
The directives of the Pope who called for fake news
And in the same article it mentioned us
Two weeks ago to be banned
So the Pope wants me off the air and his university is suing me
With taxpayer money
I mean at least you hear about the Vatican won't pay for its own electricity from Rome
They're like 20 years behind
They just go, we do not pay for electricity
We have 200 foot walls
I'm not gonna have no walls
So the Catholic Church has been totally captured
People need to pull their alumni funding in Georgetown
You need to call them and let them know that
This is war folks
This is war
And I'm being sued for saying that the State Department official that worked for Hillary
Is connected to Soros and might work for the CIA
The State Department is the CIA
So it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on
We got two lawsuits thrown out in the last week and a half
So Brittany Pettibone, break down what happened, what's going on
I mean this is a concerted effort
We've got to raise the alarm
I would say on a Richter scale
What would you say, I mean previous censorship was maybe a three, a four
This is like an eight
I mean this is sustained across the board
Massive governments coming after our speech
You're being suppressed by the British government
They're arresting people that criticize Islam
Like a regular pen in France in Germany
They're coming after everybody
I mean this is really going on
So investigative journalists, Brittany Pettibone
Define yourself since they want to define you and steal your identity
Define who you are, what your mission is and what's happened
And where you think we are right now in this incredible attack on free speech
Well defining myself politically
I think the most appropriate term is what I've always gone with
Is an American nationalist
And you know I'm pro-Trump
And I've been interested in politics my entire life
And I kind of got by accident politically active
Because of the presidential elections
But you know obviously they define us as all sorts of things
I don't even bother fighting back against it anymore
I mean they call Trump Hitler so
You just can't trust these people
But regarding what happened to us
It seemed like some kind of coordinated effort
Because you saw they went after Lauren Southern
Right after my boyfriend and me
And you know it's one thing to hear about the lack of freedom of speech in the UK
But it's quite another to experience it
And it's not only been eye-opening for us
But I think for many people
And I really hope that it will encourage people to speak out against this
I've gotten so many messages from people in the UK
Like I'm just embarrassed for my country
Embarrassed because you know Britain used to be so great
They're saying well not so much anymore
And you also have to question how much they put into shutting down people like myself
My boyfriend Martin Selner, Lauren Southern
And then things like this tele-forward scandal that just broke
Like the biggest child sex abuse scandal in the history of Britain
Over the past 40 years up to like a thousand children abused
One girl I believe she was about 15 years old
She was gotten pregnant six times over the course of four years
It's absolutely unacceptable
Especially after Rotherham how they could dare to allow this to happen again
So their priorities are just all out of whack right now
It's really infuriating
And finally the BBC reports on girls as young as seven being groomed
And used for sex slavery by the Muslims
Who turned into a business
And then the rich left this men
Brits come and actually use it
And so they kind of use the Muslims
Who were famous for using women as sex slaves
As the folks that tend their slave stables
Or they have a word for it
Of course in Islam in the Middle East it's called a harem
So they have their pedophile harems
What do you make of Sadiq Khan being hailed as the great feminist
It's South by Southwest, I don't know if you knew that
Then being hailed as a man of the women
Who will defend women with Islam
It's a complete contradiction
It's a paradox
Islam and feminism are not compatible
Okay so Lauren Southern was accused of racism
Which is why she wasn't allowed into the UK
Because she criticized Islam which is a religion not a race
So the whole purpose of this social experiment
Which I actually participated in
And they didn't bring this up as one of the reasons as to why I was banned
Was Vice released an article saying
There's a possibility he could have been gay
So we were thinking, okay
So if they can do this
All religions really treated equal
Let's go to the UK, pretend to be leftist activists
You know pro-LGBT
Coming and saying, you know, Allah
It's one religion that accepts everyone
You know feminism, gays, everything
And the way that
This video hasn't finished yet, perhaps we'll release it
But the way the reaction was incredible
Within seconds the police were there
And they had already gotten complaints
We need to remove you for your safety immediately
We had to confiscate the flyers, everything
It was an insane situation
But this is it, you can't criticize Islam
It's completely protected, that's why they
You see them persecuting Tommy Robinson so much
Who I was going to interview
He eventually flew to Vienna, we did the interview
It is I think one of the best he's ever done
Because we break down and go step by step
Through his five different times in prison
How he was put in there blackmailed by the police
Everything that he has suffered and sacrificed
In his quest to expose Islam
For what it is
Well, I mean, radical Islam
Is the number one threat to Muslims
It's killed tens of millions of their own people
I know there are a lot of Muslims who are hard working
Smart people, I've known a lot of them
But they're really, you know, heretics
Want to drink a beer with you
Yeah, I have an uncle who's Muslim
Well, I mean, let's talk about that
Because I mean, it's a fact, the biggest victim
Of Islam is Islam
Yeah, it's the religion
You can read about it, it's not just
You know, Muslims are randomly acting out
And it's like, where is this coming from?
You can read it, you can see it
In their religion, it's written there
So, I mean, my uncle, he
Has been very kind, he's one of my favorite uncles
We've been close
Pretty much my entire life, so there's, you know
Not a bad word I can say about him, but it's just
You look at the religion and then look at
The Muslims, you know, the radicals
The way they're acting and you have to criticize it
They just, they won't even let you question it
Or criticize it, it's a huge problem
And then these grooming gangs
Many Muslims are the ones responsible
Well, it's not like many
Even the mainstream media admits it's basically
Their business, and then
The girls act up, they just disappear
Yeah
Hearing about the lawsuits against myself
Congressman West and others by
Georgetown University
Which is run by the Vatican
But they admit taxpayer money funds the law school
Try, and they're calling
In the suit for us to be shut off the air
CNN's calling for us to be shut off the air
They use the State Department official kind of
As their, you know, got to personalize it
But it is Georgetown doing it
What do you make of this
And the left calling for all of us to be banned
And again, Marie Le Pen being arrested
For saying the biggest threat
Since World War II to France
Is radical Islam, I mean, that's a total
That's absolutely true
Honestly, I'm not shocked at all
I think we've all seen this coming for a while
Now, the thing is like the mainstream media
You know, a lot of older people watch it
But the youth are watching these
Independent creators who aren't
You know, beholden to anyone
And can basically go out and report on
What they want to report on, talk about what
They want to talk about, they're free
And they want to shut these people down
By any means necessary because
Like infowars, you know, all these alternative media outlets
They are challenging
These big mainstream media outlets
And they're going to overtake them soon
So they have to shut them down
Because otherwise they're going to fade into obscurity
And if they don't control the narrative
They don't control people
And this is classic authoritarianism
Nakedly being carried out
And Trump must move
People, but we can't wait for Trump
He's doing a great job getting rid of Tillerson
And moving Pompeo and everything else
But ladies and gentlemen
All of you, if you're alumni at Georgetown
And you're not a snot-nosed globalist
You've got to pull your money
I think there should be lawsuits
Against them
There's all sorts of issues
Trying to get rid of the free speech
And I think my rights violated like Jim Crow
Well that's why I'm here
Because you're going to try to do this
But you're looking to go ahead
I know that everything our Supreme Court
Is in July
And then I can call an E memo
And I can print it without even looking at it
But I don't just have material
Just got a few hours to get ready
To be good
I'm on my own

I'm so excited. The new product at InfowarsLife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled
to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill,
a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's
beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to
their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for
the formulae, and I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and
your purchase fuzz the operation.
We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. I'm Alex Jones. As we defend the first, the second
amendment you name it. Wow, what a time to be alive. That's right. Crashing the lies
and disinformation. Woo. I love it. Crank it up for a minute. The old lady's music,
a red rocker. He's a great guy.
She said, son, just one more. All right. Here's the deal. I can't drive 55 and I sure as hell
can't live under globalism and Islamic Sharia law, ally with a bunch of weird soy boy left
us. It didn't happen. Now I was just talking to some of the crew in there. Imagine what
Trump's going through. If Democrats and Hillary lawyers have filed, I guess if you count the
two EOC's as two things, it's 12 lawsuits in the last year and most of them the last
couple of months. And we've already gotten six of them thrown out, two of them the last
eight, nine days last week of this week. So I'm trying to be positive here because I want
to fight the globalist. I want to change the world. And Trump just got rid of tellers and
the word is for leaking and for going along with different globalist operations, just
like they just got rid of Trump's assistant. They're, they're watching who's leaking. That's
what's happening. And Trump is consolidating control of the executive like he's supposed
to do. And the globalist are just hitting more shrill, more insane. Congress just came
out and said, no, there's no Russian collusion. There's actually collusion by Hillary Nunes
says, which we all know about back in the day of the New York Times admitted that, you
know, real bonafide, Hey, uranium for money, put it in my private bank account and put
it in Podesta's bank account. And so Brittany Pettibone is an investigative journalist calls
herself a nationalist. And that's exactly what I am. It's just somebody that wants to
have their own sovereignty and she's joining us right now. She got basically put in prison
for three days with her boyfriend. He was going to speak at Speaker's Corner. She, they
said, well, you can't speak at Speaker's Corner. You're inciting problems, even though his
speech was known. It was a pro free speech speech. She wasn't allowed to talk to Tommy
Robinson, try to talk to a reporter. And then Laura Southern also got grabbed separately
coming in because she's a racist. They just said so. And Michael Sabbath can't come in
because he says Islam isn't a religion of peace. And Siddy Khan says, Trump can't come
in. This is an amazing time to be alive. So Brittany Pettibone and the six, seven minutes
we have left, where do you see this fight going? Marie Le Pen facing prison. She's the
front runner, of course, the French elections for saying it. So, so where do you see all
this going? I see this being determined by enough people deciding to stand up and take
a stand with us because obviously we can't do this by ourselves. So if enough people
in the Western world will just say, just get over their fear, stop living in this, this
mental prison of in, you know, basically having no ideological freedom. If they can find the
courage to do this, I think then we will be okay. But it's just like even after what happened
in the UK, I still don't believe the UK is lost. And it really perturbs me when people
say that, you know, France is lost, the UK is lost, Sweden's lost, Germany's lost,
whatever, not yet. There's still a chance. So I think that it's going to come down just
to the average people. And if they're not willing to do that in time, then, you know,
we just might be lost.
You're absolutely right. If we don't start recognizing the draconian, authoritarian,
those aren't just words, those are real things that this is the death of the West free speech,
the right to defense and an open alliance with the UN, the globalist, the Vatican, radical
Islam, the communist Chinese and Hollywood. But like you said, I'm not bragging when
I say this when I go to my children's school, and when I go to other schools, they're having
school events or sporting events, I get mobbed. And the kids love me. And the college folks
love me. And it's weird because I've always been targeting the military, the police, the
government trying to wake them up to the globalist takeover. We're having success there because
they know what our info is accurate because they're inside there and then they know what
to look for. A lot of them know more than I do, but I'm just, it's collaborative ever.
But the youth, it's just devastating. And the globalists admit that's what they're so
scared of.
So a 44 year old guy like me, I know you guys are popular, Paul Watson, super popular, Gavin
McGuinness are, they are the rock stars. It's not the sports players. It's not even, you
know, the pop singers anymore. It is the Liberty movement. And that is just to me really weird.
But they admit that this new generation Z is the most anti authoritarian, most libertarian
ever. Now the one after them, the millennials are the most communist. So what do you think
is going on there, Brittany Pettibone?
Yeah, our education system is completely flooded with these people, these communist socialists.
You know, someone once suggested to me, and I think it's a great idea, they should start
a reality show where they, you know, bring these people who are so in favor of favor
of communism socialism, drop them into these countries where it's actually a reality and
just see how they do. It would be hilarious. I would watch for the first time reality TV
if they did that.
I think these people really don't understand what they're asking for. I think it's more
like, oh, you know, I'd get free college, I'd get free health care, but they just, they
don't understand.
And you can spread the wheel and say, do you, are you going to go to Cuba, Venezuela, North
Korea, or, you know, perhaps, and then, oh, you're going, it's going to be great. And notice
they've always got skinny jeans. They've always got a nice phone. They're bitching because
their car isn't brand new. They're getting their college paid for and they're so pissed
and they hate America so much.
And you know, what's interesting Alex is like Antifa, you look at Antifa and you know,
they think they're these, you know, anarchists, the rebellion against the authoritarian regime.
But if you look at, look at what they're trying to accomplish. The government is in
exact alignment with it. They're trying to shut us down. So are the government. So if
you really think about it, they're just the foot soldiers for the government.
They are the brown shirts. They're the modern brown shirts.
It's really laughable that they can't see this. They don't have enough self-awareness
to see this. But I mean, this whole thing that's happened to us, we are going to appeal
it. Lauren is joining me in Vienna within the next couple of days. We're all going to work
with the same lawyer, Martin, Lauren and I, and we're going to appeal this, try to get
it overturned. Well, it's going to be a big fight. I think a battle ahead, but we're going
to do what we can because it's completely unjust what's happened to us.
Well, since the media is trying to say it ever happened, you ought to just come in with
your live streaming at the airport, walk right up, have them throw and then, you know, they'll
say that doesn't exist. But again, Sadiq Khan and others are saying, don't let Trump come.
Yeah. And there's no good reason for that at all. I don't even understand the reasoning
behind this. He's the president of the United States.
It's amazing. Well, we're going to put on screen that Michael Savage has been banned.
What, seven years he's been banned from the UK?
Yes. I actually believe that Lauren will be speaking with him soon about her ban. So that
should be a very interesting interview. But Michael Savage, yeah, I've been a fan for a
while through my father. He introduced me. Really, really great.
All right. Well, Brittany Pettibone, it's great to get you on a familiar with your work. Please
come on any time you've got breaking news. And I just, it's really a pleasure to see
the great job you and your boyfriend are doing in Lord Southern and the whole team. So we
just want to salute you. And I think the more they try to suppress all of our speech, I
think more great minds like yourself are going to come forward. What do you think of the
first CIA director being a woman being appointed by Trump?
It's hilarious. But I think they'll find, they're finding ways to still criticize him
for this. He can do nothing right. If he found the cure for cancer, they'd find some way
to criticize that.
All right, Brittany Pettibone, thank you so much.
Thanks so much, Alex.
Thank you. Godspeed. Wow. That's amazing. All right. I'm going to come back and get
into a bunch of other news that we've not hit yet because there is a plethora. There
is a cornucopia. There is a compendium of it and a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to
and I probably should open the phones up more. We've just got so many guests and we've got
one of the other journalists, Lee Strainahan, who's being sued by the Pope, the Vatican
through Georgetown with taxpayer money is suing us and calling for us to be taken off
the air. I mean, my Lord, this is incredible.

Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in Info Wars live broadcasting. We are live
weekdays from three to six p.m. central at infowars.com slash show and this YouTube
channel right here that you've landed on. Please subscribe to the channel for updates
and notifications. You can follow us on Twitter at war room show. We are going to have the
most powerful guests, the most powerful host will be hearing from Alex Jones regularly
as well as taking your phone calls. The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative
for too long. The silent majority is no longer silent. This is The War Room. I want to plow
into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners
to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos
or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I cannot say
it any clearer. It is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com. I want to
thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal
silver and with high-quality atomic iodine. You cannot beat that for children and adults.
We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That's my dad with colloidal silver
and iodine as well. Infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139. And your purchase of the products stands
with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
satanic pedophile armies. And that's who they are and they know we know who they are
and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and
being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots
to do that in our local areas as well. And as a longtime Infowars listener, I want to
say thanks for the awesome BrainForce Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for
the Anthroplex too. Thank you.
I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
toothpaste fans. The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the Infowarslife
products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for
doing that for us to keep us healthy. Absolutely. Because then we could all as educated patriots
help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on and
if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our
country back.
wow. What a time to be alive. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from
the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. Autobots transform and roll out. Form of the
Pope's Jesuit University taxpayer funded not private suing former Congressman Alan West.
Truly Alex Jones, Lee Ann McAdoo, Lee Stranahan for saying you got a bunch of Democrat party
operatives running around at Ferguson, trying to spend it at Antifa, a bunch of sweethearts
and the president, Trump's a Nazi. And they use them as PR people everywhere. And we point
out one of the guys worked for Hillary at the State Department and it has a famous history
being tied to the CIA and running the CIA. And we just said this needs to be investigated.
Oh, we're going to sue you for fake news. And then the filing, they say that we say
crisis actors and nothing's real and all the stuff. And we said nobody, you know, died
in Florida. We didn't say that. So what it is, is their fake news. And you know, I know
enough about law to have a taxpayer funded. They think we're so stupid. University of
Georgetown, the law school putting out articles of faming me, can we put that article back
up? And I guess they think they're going to control the judges and control through the
alumni and somehow you'll get the right jury. The whole thing smells because you look at
the suit, it's a joke, witness to a tragedy, a victim of fake news conspiracy, sues Alex
Jones and others, Georgetown law. And then they say a bunch of stuff we never said or
never did. And that we say there's an imaginary deep state. But we learned about the deep
state from Carol Quigley, one of the heads of Georgetown political science, Bill Clinton's
mentor and tragedy and hope called for planetary dictatorship, the end of the family, total
social control, an elite ruling everything run out of Georgetown. But it doesn't exist.
There's no such thing. Good old Chucky Schumer never got up on CNN and said, Trump better
watch it. The intelligence agencies have seven ways to Sunday to get back at him and make
him pay and remove him. And we've been spied on him and we know he's a Russian agent.
Trump was, oh, that's illegal. And it's illegal to say you were spying with classified. But
then it turned out you just lied. You were spying on the president, but you lied about
it. Then you said, we never said that. And everybody knows what a pack of liars these
people are, but they're so used to creeping around and being in control and knowing that
America's chained up in their basement. They're sitting up there watching TV, big old slobs
were chained up down there. And the famous cases of this, they're getting our social
security checks, basically. They're sitting like big slobs, eating pointies, watching
television. You know, they got like little CIA pocket protectors feeling powerful.
That's how they walk down. We're chained up downstairs. They walk by, make us beg for
maybe a piece of bread. They walk down the dungeon. They kind of strut around. I'm feeling
really powerful right now, America. Let me just kick you in the face a little bit. Oh,
but we've got both our arms out of the shackles. And then we got our legs out. And when you
open the trapdoor to come down and rape us, globalist physically, even though we've been
emaciated and been in the dark so long, we could hardly see. We punched you, knocked
you the ground, bit a chunk out of you. And now we're stumbling around with the lights
on, trying to see, and you're screaming for mama. And here comes a big fat giant 400
pound maggot down the stairs, just slithering in. Puss dripping out of its smell of rotting
dead children in its belly. There's the big giant pus worm come to save its baby. Baby's
bleeding. Baby broke its leg when baby fell down in the dark. And so we're getting our
bearings. The light's coming back in our eyes. We weigh about 85 pounds, but you know what
we're fighting for our lives. And here comes that big worm. And what are we going to do
to that big giant stinking worm that smells like dead flesh that's squealing like a big
rat? What are we going to do to that worm? Oh, by the way, I should have started the
show with this. It was September 11th, 2016 that Hillary fell like a ton of bricks in
New York City. And then the media would cut when she fell and said, Alex Jones put up
fake news. Oh, she was slip on a curb and would show kind of this. We should have the convulsion
that it cut. Well, she was in India yesterday and the Daily Mirror got the video. It's up
on info wars.com and drug report.com, the Daily Mirror.com. She slipped not once, not
twice, but thrice. And everywhere she goes, she has men helping her. Even when she walks
on the flat, we saw that in Austin, she has to be helped. But it's okay because that's
actually her doing a dance. That's not her falling down or slipping three times. No.
That is Hillary Clinton. I think that's Uma Abedin behind her. Yeah, that's her girlfriend
right there, reportedly. Uma Abedin. Hillary's like a little flying squirrel, actually. Like
I said last night on air in that special report, she's like the Falcon flying down from the
top of the Egyptian monolith gleaming. There is our great Queen, our Lord, our Master, ex-caliber,
the purest of the greatest, beautiful Georgetown creations. The finest citizens America's ever
seen indomitable, strong, as continual as the North Star. Stoic. The very essence of
pure blood, the very blood of honor, the majestic, the transcendent, oh, look at Bill Clinton,
the handsomeness, the goodness, the lovingness. I'm going to play some more of these clips
when we come back. I want to get to Trump and what Tillerson means. This is really good
signs what's happening. But before I do that, what a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen,
to be fighting back all of us together in this basement, trying to get out of this fetid
stink hole where the lesser carry out their ritual of defiling us and dominating us. One
big way to counter them is, you know, we're bombarded with fungus and candida and all
the rest of the garbage. And we have been sold out of this for a while, and we went
to an even bigger national organic producer, put in an even bigger order, signed the year
purchase order, and got it for about 30% less, and it's way stronger. It was already very,
very strong. Myco ZX is the next level of probiotic because it doesn't just knock out
the bag of bacteria like our flora life does. It knocks out the bad yeast and mold and candida
and the rest of it, and it's 120 capsules in a big, nice, chunky glass bottle. Quapolosing
goes a nice, big, chunky bottle, and it is addresses intestinal yeast, supports a healthy
digestive system, supports healthy microbial bacteria. See, they get in there, and the
yeast and fungus creates a slime wall to steal your nutrients. And so a lot of, for a lot
of people, this is more important than gut bacteria deficiencies. And there's the four
reasons you need it. It supports healthy microbial balance of the body. It was specifically selected
ingredients to focus on intestinal yeast, helps support a healthy digestive tract, addresses
intestinal yeast, and so much more. If everybody, well, everybody got a bottle of it in five
minutes, about 1% of the listeners actually pieced up. We have a huge audience, so it
funds things in the face of all this garbage. But if more of you, I get it, most of us are
libertarians or conservatives. We're kind of stoic. We don't think about our bodies.
We exercise and stuff, but that's about it. Let me tell you something. What this has done
for people is amazing. Yo, it's yourself and your family. Just try it. It's 50% off, $27.
The old one almost cost us that to produce. We've got even better ingredients at a lower
price, so it's 50% off. It's $27. It's amazing. You can do four or five regimens of it, of
cleanses for four or five months. I do it like for a week once a month. It's incredible.
25% off brain force, 25% off survival shield, 25% off secret 12 and so much more. And as
the toothpaste sold out, fluoride free, coil silver, I-9, fortified. Find out about MycoZX
and stand in the way of Soros, Clinton, Obama, Hillary, and the-the Pope.

Today we're called 888-253-3139. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
I'll be honest with you. I woke up at about 2.50 this morning and couldn't go back to
sleep. And I could just feel the evil of the globalists. I could see them trying to destroy
our free speech and knowing how bad they are. I wasn't scared. I'm usually very positive
about things. I am very positive. And I understand the larger compendium of history and what
our mission is, is not to be famous, not to make money, but to actually change the world
and make it a better place. Because all the evil men and tyrants need to flourish as the
good men and women do nothing. Quote Thomas Jefferson. But I, about 3.30 in the morning,
got on my knees in the dark of the night in my living room. And I just asked God for strength
and discernment. And I went in and looked at my 10-month-old baby daughter who's got
her first cold because I flew an airplane with her, wheezing and stuff, and picked her
up and rocked her in my arms for hours. And I just knew where I'm supposed to be. And
it's so strong that I don't want to come on air and say, this is wonderful being sued
by Georgetown University with taxpayer money. But it really is, because I know you're going
to come through. I know we're going to win. And I know that it's going to be rough. And
I know that they want to demonize me before they kill me. I understand that. But my children
have no future if we don't beat this. And you don't either. And so I'll say it again.
I am exactly where I want to be, because I wasn't really depressed, but I worked about
17 hours yesterday. And so you just kind of get really tired. And I went to bed about
that. And so I was a little down, not for my prospects, but just that people don't realize
we're really up against pure evil. But then I just understood that this is what anybody
who wants to be a good person would dream of is actually go toe-to-toe against real
evil. And what folks don't understand that avoid conflict or avoid confrontation with
real evil, they understand this is what sharpens you. It's what brings you up. It's what opens
everything up. I mean, I'm so satisfied in my life. And it's indescribable. It's indescribable.
And I remember being a teenager or other stuff, being more ego driven, how unhappy I was,
or even a young man, I was still happier than most people, but I still had avoid somewhere.
Even though I had courage and wanted to be a good person, I didn't fully commit to it.
But that's how God does it. I was like weightlifting, slowly more weight on, more weight, more weight,
more weight, more weight, more weight. And God has answered my prayers to take on the
globalists, to see them defeated, to see the tide turn, to see the awakening happening,
to see them come against us. I mean, always in my spirit, God's like, you really want
this? Because at the end of the line, they're going to torture you and kill you. But victory
will come. And I just, it's not even a martyr syndrome, it's we can't let them win. And
then every time I pass the new threshold of the attacks, stuff people even know about
on air, it's pretty hardcore. And they've targeted my family and people surrounding
me and they're really bad people. But they think you're cowards. They think when I talk
about that, I'm scaring you for them. You're not a coward like they are. But if you're
into fear, you should fear them getting full power in what they'll do to everybody. Because
everywhere they get control in third world countries, everywhere they get control in
these government orphanages, everywhere these people migrate to, these evil globalists,
they are into tearing up civilization and tearing up humanity in front of everybody.
Paul Watson's done a really incredible report. I went too long. It's like a seven minute
report. I'm going to play it. We start the next hour. Do we ever get Pachena Kongs?
I want to get him on this Tillerson thing. I was right. He can't tomorrow. And we've
got at least trying to hand being sued by the Vatican as well. I love how honest people
are so honest. Everyone's going, oh, we're being sued by the State Department guy. No,
we're being sued by Georgetown and by the Pope with taxpayer money. And then they call
for the end of free speech and to set a precedent to ban everyone and then to have the media
in Georgetown decide what can be on air and what can't. I mean, it's a total overthrow
of the First Amendment. It's so epic. It's incredible. And it's all a slanderous defamation,
misrepresentation of what I said and what we said about the event. Like everything else,
it's just a big PR campaign and it's going nowhere. Doesn't matter how many little things
they pull, no matter what they do, the truth is coming out. We've got so much to get to,
so much to cover. And this is a Kit Daniels article up on infowars.com. Trump fires Goldstein
in the Mid-State Department purge. President also cutting through isolation by staff. And
when you read this, it's really important to know that Trump is getting rid of the right
people. By the way, let me make this point. You read this lawsuit and you read their articles
about it and the press releases put out by the law school that is an open war with the
First Amendment. You read this historical, unbelievable case. I mean, that's what this
is. This is incredible. This is how they come for the First Amendment. And it's written
for the public. It's written for the media's talking points, but then it's written for
the Spooks and the CIA and they bitch in there and they go, Comey 2012, Jones said that was
fake. And by the way, I did say that was fake and it came out later. It was all a PR firm
and the guy running it flipped out, remember, was running around going crazy on the street.
Remember that? Pull up the head of the Comey group goes crazy, run around naked. Remember
that? And but then it later came out in the news that they knew where Comey was and we're
just using that to bring African into Africa. And I've talked to military people that were
there and knew where he was and he was being supplied and protected and they're suing me.
It's like the lawsuit goes, look, Alex messed up our Vegas operation. It's not even this
guy's suit. It's all about Jones said Comey was fake and that they could have killed
it. And then Jones says that the Parkland shooting is fake. I didn't say that. I mean,
the hostage rescue team called us and said, look, there's Islamic crap everywhere. He
went to the Middle East. So did she. There was other women in there. Was a gun deal
gone bad. Look at the Saudi Arabians in town. Oh, let's get Zach, one of our other sources
back on old Zach, formerly with the army now with that other 18th agency. But the point
is, is that can you imagine that this will now be brought out? It's kind of like when
E Howard Hunt sued the spotlight for saying that he was involved in JFK and then later
he had a deathbed confession and said he was he was photographed twice. He was arrested
in the rail car. He told his son he ran the operation. He's Ethan Hunt, a mission impossible.
He Howard Hunt. He's the guy that portally had over 200 kills in China by himself. Parachuted
in at the start of World War II is an intelligence operative. He's a famous guy. He didn't pull
the trigger, but he was there running the killing of Kennedy and he lost that lawsuit
against the spotlight. And now he gave a video, an audio confession that premiered here and
on Coast to Coast AM with George Norring. In 2008, I was a benchwarmer on the operation.
Hardmire was mad. Kennedy had been banging his wife and there's old Jim Mars. Those interviews
are online right now on our YouTube channel. They're trying to get rid of. That's some
of the first videos we put up on our YouTube channel in 2008. Oh, it's been taken down.
Click on those. World exclusive. Click on one. This video is unavailable. And I've also
noticed we were over 2 billion views. YouTube just deletes our videos all the time and then
doesn't even tell us why. So that had millions of views. It went down like 1.5 billion. They
like, it's got your car, this pedometer or the tachometer, you know, the mileage goes
backwards. My car's got 40,000 minus miles on it. I thought I drove 40,000 miles. So
our YouTube channel, the view count goes backwards. And then they're on the news going, hurry
up and sensor Alex Jones. They're already sensory is all over the place, but then it's
having a Streisand effect. And all these weird Ivy League CIA, they're all wimps who never
were actually in the military or anything, but they just, they want to be analysts and
in charge of men. And then they all just want little CIA code bought little decoder rings
and little secret societies. And you know, they go to Yale and crap on each other's faces
and flop around having gay sex. And by the way, that's even in the good shepherd, which
is an accurate rendition of skull and bones with Matt Damon and of course, a producer
and directed by Robert De Niro. But then the media goes, Jones claims they pee on each
other. It's going both little liar. We don't know that's Trump and Russia. No, they crap
on each other. All right. And worship Lucifer and are born again undead and eat crap. That's
who runs thing. A bunch of Ivy League people that eat turds. We've taken thousands of
years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
to find the very best systems that God gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body.
That's why I'm introducing the shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made
in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated
with detoxifying the body and it supports the info or it is a classical 360 when this
is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year. And now we believe
we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
get. You want to yourself, you want to your family and you owe it to the future of this
country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
can be. Because we need you, the remnant of America to reignite those rush fires the next
level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your
prayers together. We're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z shield
in fourslife.com. They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools
to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars
and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
And then they use their ex president to endorse the resistance all to make them march, make
them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows,
burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding until
the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when
that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this,
the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the
clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's
safest place. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Coming to you from the former
United States of America from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones. Yeah, you
know, I think we need to come in the next segment with Tiger by the tail because Georgetown
a supposed private university that gets hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxpayer
money for their law school thinks they're going to sue me using taxpayer money trying
to overthrow free speech. And they think because they've picked a quote radical target like
Info Wars and Congressman Ellen West, do they say as a white supremacist actually say he's
all right, which means white supremacist. He's black guy, black army colonel. They think
we'll all just roll over or they'll sue enough people that somebody will settle so they can
declare victory and then set a precedent that we're fake news in the agreement so they
can then start massive censorship in this country. It's incredible. I'm going to play
a special Paul Watson reports coming up in the next segment that I'm going to get through
much of the news we haven't hit on the economy tellers and you name it but just briefly here
because it's so important and it's funding and operation. It's been sold out for months

and how great they are for your gut because of toxins the environment pesticides herbicides
bio accumulate it kills off good bacteria bad ones move in but more importantly than
bad bacteria the probiotics help this place yeast mold and other things that fill in those
gaps create slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get
in there it causes all sorts of serious issues and a lot of people understand this and know
this they know about yeast and molds and the mutations and all things are going on well
this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that
slime wall and known to flush that out of your body. I take three or four pills for
a week each day incredible results only a few times a year but you can do it basically
all the time because these herbs are all really good for you with all the dangerous toxins

last friday i was reading the news that tillerson was sick in kenyan couldn't give speeches
and then my phone rang from a certain little birdie who's stuck on a plane that's late
he'll be with us tomorrow and the certain little birdie bird told me that no tillerson
was out but that we need to wait on that it might be a couple weeks well he was actually
fired that day so well we're waiting for tillerson they're saying to make a statement
at the state department as he flew back from africa and so again that just shows their
disinfo he wasn't feeling too well after he had his little talk with the chief of staff
john kelly so we're going to be watching that we punch up fox for folks so people can see
the press briefing room there and we will watch that as it develops and again right there
as you can see for tv viewers where we are watching that 207 eastern time 107 central
standard time but i want to play this report just to illustrate this for you from our own
paul joseph watson that there they are stopping britney pettibone and lauren southern and others
coming in they know they've been to the uk many times of no criminal records their journalists
to interview tommy robinson but they let radical islamists who who are admittedly a part of
terror groups to come in and to go back and forth and even rehabilitate them and give
them money and put them in government housing this just illustrates how the left's ally
with islam sadeek cons here in austin you're calling for censorship it just goes on and
on the islamic mayor of london so here's what's really happening in london here's paul
joseph watson's report the uk is really good at keeping out extremists you know like when
they kept out iraqi extremist amed hassan after he told border officials he'd been
trained to kill by isis oh no they let him in and gave him asylum but at least they deported
him after he was caught watching isis videos and singing jihadi songs with the lyrics we
are coming with you to the slaughter in your home and country oh no they didn't and he
went on to bomb a train okay but wait that's just one case usef zagbaugh who in 2016 told
officials quote i'm going to be a terrorist and then went on to carry out the london
bridge terrorist attack a year later not like we let that guy in oh shake hands a soda
car who called for homosexuals to be burned to death and thrown off cliffs was stopped
from entering the uk when he tried to give a series of lectures in london oh no he was
given a visa and welcomed in okay but some are going to slip through the cracks right
sayad musafar sharkadri a preacher considered so extreme he was banned in pakistan someone
who praised the murderer of a politician in pakistan who spoke out against blasphemy
laws at least he was banned from the uk now he was allowed in and went on to do a speaking
tour of british mosques okay but muhammad nakib ureman and hasam hasib ureman two muslin
clerics who praised the same assassin in pakistan they were kept out right no they were welcomed
by the archbishop of canterbury okay mistakes were made but at least we stopped 400 returning
isis jihadists from reentering the uk right at least we were serious enough about stopping
extremism to make sure that didn't happen no they were all allowed in and then offered
council housing and welfare okay but at least the uk doesn't roll out the red carpet for
leaders of saudi arabia a country in which gay people are fined arrested imprisoned
tortured and killed oh so what extremists are we stopping from entering the uk martin
selner a right-wing activist who planned to give a speech in speakers corner hide park
about the threat to free speech and britney petibone an author and activist who planned
to conduct an interview with tommy robinson a national figure who's made numerous appearances
on national television and lauren southern a conservative journalist who planned to make
videos and work on a documentary and lauren was specifically banned for handing out leaflets
which said a la is a gay god maybe if she'd have just represented a country that enforces
the industrial persecution of homosexuals she'd have been embraced with open arms it's also
interesting how petibone was detained and deported for attempting to interview tommy
robinson a fate that didn't await journalists from a bc and mbc news when they arrived
in the uk to interview tommy robinson now just indulge me for a second but it's almost
as if all these reasons are absolute bullshit and the real reason for them being banned
is that the uk is an authoritarian country which has de facto begun enforcing blasphemy
laws that make criticism of islam which is a belief system and not a race okay let's
stop right there we'll come back with more of this in a moment let's go to the secretary
of state former secretary of state outgoing rex tillerson sacked with his deputy um goldstein
removed as well as trump purges the neoconson globals let's go to this most important is
to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to
face significant policy and national security challenges as such effective at the end of
the day i'm delegating all responsibilities of the office of the secretary to deputy secretary
of state sullivan my commission of secretary of state will terminate at midnight march
the 31st between now and then i will address a few administrative matters related to my
departure and work towards a smooth and orderly transition for secretary of state designate
mike Pompeo i'm encouraging my policy planning team and undersecretaries and assistant secretaries
those confirmed as well as those in acting positions to remain at their post and continue
our mission at the state department and run office team and policy planning later today
to thank them for their service they have been extraordinarily dedicated to our mission
which includes promoting values that i've used being very important for the safety and security
of our state department personnel accountability which means treating each other with honesty
and integrity and respect for one another most recently in particular to address challenges
of sexual harassment within the department i want to speak now to my state department
colleagues and to our interagency colleagues and partners at dod and the joint chief of
staffs most particularly to my foreign service officers and civil service colleagues we
all took the same oath of office whether your career employee or political pointy we are
all bound by that common commitment to support and defend the constitution to bear true faith
and allegiance to the same and to faithfully discharge the duties of our office well this
is all coded as a state department we are bound together by that oath this is really
cryptic we remain steadfast here in washington and it posts across the world many of whom
are in danger pay situations without their families this is some kind of signal to stay
behind that works world needs selfless leaders like these he's really proven to be a double
agent work with longstanding allies new emerging partners and allies who now many are struggling
as democracies and in some cases are dealing with human tragedy crisis of natural disasters
literally crawling themselves out of those circumstances all coded these are experiences
that no lecture hall in an academic environment for a think tank can teach you only by people
going to the front lines to serve can they develop this kind of talent to the men and
women in uniform I'm told for the first time in most people's memory the department state
department of defense have a close working relationship where we all agree the US leadership
starts with diplomacy the men and women in uniform at the department of defense under
leadership of secretary mattis and general dunford protect us as americans on our way
of life daily at home and abroad as an all volunteer military all right he's just basically
virtually signaling now without earlier stuff about taking the oath and everybody needs
to stay at their posts and everything that was state or post I guess means deep state
there hang on galore is coming but let me tell you there's major infiltration and look
I'm not even saying tillers is a bad guy but he's a yes man he can't handle the pressure
of what I'm sure they've done to him the word is he's being removed and was so stunned by

lawyers in the country he's the guy that represents the big republicans represented
by Breitbart I'm not going to get into all of it he's one of the top lawyers he represents
been some of these other cases we've already gotten shut down and he's watching and listening
right now and reading the complaint and I'm not going to get into all that but he said
exactly what I thought before I said more stuff he said this is highly unusual Georgetown
doing this we've got to look into taxpayer money being used if it is at this clinic most
of these universities have a pro free speech clinic this is an anti free speech clinic
and he said it's highly unusual and we'll talk more later today when I get off air but
he said he's cross-referencing the complaint it's exactly as I thought it is horsemaner
we talked to our other trademark lawyers who are really you know top 20 group in the
country and they check with another group in Los Angeles who is in the top five and
they said absolutely the Mr. Fury the creator of the comic book that never really went
anywhere but that's fine until the public picked it up Peppy the Frog he gave daily
dot interviews and others and said everyone use it I love it good people use it white
supremacist use it it's okay they're idiots but you know Peppy's a happy guy everyone
has total rights to use my frog there's the headline Peppy the Frog creator invited people
to profit off Peppy close quote 2015 interview then we sell a poster that a third party made
were 5% of the images Peppy totally transformative Supreme Court rulings I talked to again both
of the trademark groups because I wanted to be sure so I talked to our regular trademark
folks that did trademarks for us and check things and then they got me to other folks
who I talked to yesterday and they said Mr. Jones we don't hardly ever say sue someone
they said we think we'll just do this for court costs we want to sue Mr. Fury but they
said because this is so outrageous against the First Amendment they said we want you
to send him the letter we're writing a letter today they're writing a letter and then he's
got a chance to apologize and tell us who funded him or we're going to sue him with
a slap back I'm not a lawyer but slap back provision all of it it is insane they said
they've never seen it except McDonald's in the 90s early 90s sued the McDonald's family
in Scotland who are royal because they keep their castle going by bed and breakfast hotel
and they have a pub restaurant called McDonald's that has been there for wait for it as a place
where they sell food was it 400 years but they never got a trademark McDonald's still
sued them this is that level of cockamamie boulder dash this is lunatic level and by
lunatic level I don't think he's a lunatic I'm saying it's crazy that this is what they're
doing and again I don't want to make it about me they're coming for the First Amendment
now let's go back to Tillerson I was told last week by my State Department source then
I called a CIA source and they said that's absolutely it Tillerson was not told and ladies
later came out a day later about the Kim Jong Un meeting he got angry and Trump said I keep
telling you I'm the only person that matters he doesn't mean the only person that matters
he means they asked well what about all your brother people you know they have this background
or this guy's a neocon this guy's a liberal this guy's a globalist Trump goes I'm the
only one that matters I listen to them I make the decision well John Oliver and Bill Maher
all made the same kind of jokes that I think Bill Maher said that he was like Violet in
the Charlie and the chocolate factory that says daddy I want that oompa no he's saying
he makes the decisions he then delegates I know for a fact from folks that run the room
Trump the day after he got inaugurated it was the night I went to the CIA called it all
the senior people it was a room of hundreds of people and he said give me all your reports
and all the targets you weren't allowed to hit and I'm delegating to all of you and it
all starts in one week and they gave them all people know I have the sources American
flags carved into wood about two by three that he paid for now we broke that and then
later the news found out and had to spin it did taxpayers pay for the flags no Trump
paid for the flags and then they try to say well is that a payoff this oh give me a break
the president can give people American flags come on man but and then it happened so it's
not he's even a control freak if he's got confidence he looks the info he thinks it's
a good idea he goes green light Obama would sit there in the room sometimes at night with
sports center on one TV and an predator drones on the other and he liked to sit there and
watch the drones blow people up Trump's never done that and Obama said I'm really good at
killing people can you imagine like it's a video game and he would sit there in I guess
it's the East Wing or wherever the recorders are on the second floor he would sit there
in his jogging suit and give the order on the phone of when the CIA could drop the bombs
I mean give me a break man and then he said I'm really good at killing people because
he liked to be on the sat foam or the con command down the bunker you do it both ways
just come out the news and and he would he would tell him execute like it's a video game
he would sit there and there it is Obama Bragg in new book I'm really good at killing people
and again he would select he would target and he would give the orders because he's
imagine he's never been in the military he's a leftist and so he wanted to not just say
here are the targets they're signed off on he would sit there and give the order in real
time because he got off on it imagine you know if you're this bathhouse Barry you know
other gets affected he's bisexual I'm just saying bathhouse Barry it's kind of a thrill
you know just like a skull and bones is a thrill for you know the bushes everybody to
piss each other's faces and wall around human excrement by the way I'm only saying all this
because it's true you know it was a it was Charlotte is your bees father who was a good
guy by the way who she was the one gave Anthony Sutton the congressional investigator in the
80s all those color bones documents you know that and if you think I'm joking about that
go watch again the Good Shepherd with Matt Damon produced and directed by you know the
good fella Robert De Niro and that shows a guy in a devil outfit with a crown on and
the sword and guys wall around and two feet of excrement pissing on each other and I'm
not trying to be gross here on air they're mad and want you to be all goody tissue when
you didn't hire Trump to be appeared and you hired him to fix the country he never said
he didn't like women and he's bad because he was some big old jumbo you know Tartt
I mean me personally see I'm not like these globalists that are little kids and stuff
that's what I like big you know full on the whole nine yards Marilyn Monroe type woman
I'm married happily the point is and I tell you I make the joke my wife she was her car

if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance that we need your help
getting the signal through
the
Hillary Clinton. It's the new order and Michael Moore. Go back to where you came from.
We're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma. You got that jacket? You're done! It's over! Worldwide!
Get him back! Get him back!
Do you think there was more than half of us?
For sure. I think you did.
It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
Well, they have sued myself. They've sued a man that runs a very successful journalism center, a guy that has millions of viewers a week on his own radio and TV programs.
At least train a hand. I know he's a frequent guest, so I mean to get him on with David Knight and the program we do in the morning, the David Knight Show.
We were calling it Real News, the Democrats sued us over the term Real News. They trademarked it. I'm not kidding. This is what we're dealing with, the 12 lawsuits.
We've gotten six thrown out, two in the last week and a half, with prejudice, meaning the court said, you know, this is bad. You can't come back at Mr. Jones.
We had the folks agree to that because they didn't want to be countersued. I was going to leave it at that.
But I just talked to my lawyer who is a humble guy, but he is one of the top anti-defamation, you know, defense lawyers out there.
And he's listening right now and he said, to have this clinic and to have this university funding this is, let me just say, highly, highly unusual.
And I said, am I right? It'll become a big issue of taxpayer funds if it's in any part of the law school.
He's like, yeah, let's talk when you get off the air, but this is unprecedented.
Basically, he said, all of these law schools have pro-free speech clinics. He goes, this has been set up to destroy the First Amendment.
And what they put in the brief is, from my view, defamation and is meant to destroy the First Amendment.
I mean, and I've got a top lawyer just read it and he's like, he's not a very excitable guy and he sounded excited a little bit.
So I'll tell you about my lawyer sometime I'll get him on, but the point is that I just mentioned this earlier.
The Pepe suit last week that I stole Pepe the Frog because I sold somebody's third party poster that's images of the campaign.
And it's Pepe's 5% and it's transformative. You can do that. That's totally protected.
There were suits against Andy Warhol saying he couldn't sell Campbell's suits cans that he altered.
And they said, if he feels like he altered it, he can sell it.
Well, but when you're a third party seller, you'd have to get an injunction and a ruling.
Then they could do an injunction on me and then it's an injunction or a trade deal and sometimes federal marshals would raid you.
But that's if it was like NFL stuff or something. It's just crazy.
Anybody can paint public figures all day long and sell them.
And again, I've had two trademark firms look at it, but one of them just does trademark and the other one does litigation.
They both do it, but the other one's one of the top ones are in Los Angeles.
And they said, we believe in the First Amendment and we sue people all the time that violate trademarks.
They do both. They said, this is, in their words, crazy.
The guy is on record saying everybody can use my image almost like a trolling operation, you know, Getty before he's been caught like saying,
you could use these website designs for these images. Then a year later, oh, you'd read the fine print.
Now you owe us all this money. They got in trouble for that and stopped doing it.
And we subscribe to Getty Images and a bunch of others. I'm not attacking them.
They're more affordable now, but I want to go to Leastranahan.
What I'm getting at here is I sat there until 10.30 last night watching the videos they're suing us for.
And the Leastranahan one with Leanne McAdoo is the easiest one to cut out.
They should be day one at the hearing.
My lawyers think should be just cut out. Leanne and Leastranahan will probably be too, but completely cut out because
I don't want to say it's milk toast, but he's a journalist. You know, he's got, you know, that's his background.
He very just said, look, this guy's a Politico. He's a Democrat.
We got to look at the background. They're called martyr day one.
We're not saying at stage. We're saying they've picked Politico's that were at the rally to be the spokesperson.
Just like we said, the kids, we're not saying nobody died. Nobody got shot in the floor.
We're saying they picked out of 3,000 kids for that are anti-gun. That's a fact. And it turned out it was true.
They spun that and said, none died.
I had a guy try to fight me and my son at the airport this weekend saying, how dare you say no kids died?
How dare you be mean and demand David Hogg come on your show.
And I'm like, David Hogg wanted to come on my show.
I didn't see you. So, so this is the, this is the, we're, we're here.
This is their plan to get rid of free speech.
Newscore said a month ago in the Wall Street Journal, the new CEO that he met with all these people.
So let's go to Lee Strandinghand. We'll do him a little bit in the next hour or two.
And we got PJW coming on, but I'm going to talk to him as well as well, but free for all if Lee Strandinghand can do it.
And we'll also give you his website, citizenjournalistschool.com, thepopulist.us.
Talk about Gonzo journalism.
I'm actually super excited that I am in the first amendment case of US history.
It looks like not just the millennium, I mean, I mean, not just the other century.
This is just, and I talked to my lawyer and he's like, absolutely, I've never seen anything like this.
This is wild. Lee, how are you feeling? I saw you during the break.
I've seen you on David during the break. You don't look this happy. You're a serious guy.
You look pretty happy as well.
I am, you know, first off, I got to say, Alec, it's a, it's a pleasure to be on with you.
The first time I'm on with you, I wish I were under better circumstances, but these are pretty good circumstances.
You've covered the issue that this is being filed by a law school. Let me bring up something.
I don't know if you, I don't think you brought this up yet. Let me bring it up.
I just want you to think about this from the perspective of what they're teaching the students about defamation law.
Right. I've been a reporter for about 10 years.
I've made it a point to read landmark decisions like New York Times versus Sullivan.
That's a great decision. That is the most famous case.
That's right. It's a fascinating decision, very well written. Anybody can read it and understand it.
And I highly recommend it. Let's go over what's going on here because you watched the whole interview that I did with Leanne McAdoo last year, right?
Yes.
Read the lawsuit. I want someone to underline for me one incorrect statement that I made.
I literally don't say anything in there that is not a fact.
You've been reviewed. You and Leanne, you and Leanne were like the highest standards.
Yep. And I, here's a, this is a note to the law students whose school is putting out this suit. Note to you.
Let me explain. I'm not a lawyer, thank God, but let me explain defamation law to you. Okay.
Defamation are false statements. Anybody can look this up.
Intended on purpose to do harm.
That's right. So there were no false statements. Let's just start there. None.
So just on that basis, it's over. It was part of a 50 minute interview.
And I think this is the thing people need to understand. This is what's in New York Times versus Sullivan.
Alex, this is an attempt to shut down any views that they don't like.
They admit they're trying to set a precedent that they just say what's fake news and then ban that person from communication into some ghetto.
Well, and I lived in Austin 15 years ago.
So you have a huge audience now and a great audience, but I knew who Alex Jones was 15, 20 years ago.
Right. And, you know, and you've been fighting this for long enough where you know that this is this is one battle in a very long war.
And when we see the things that have happened today, bloody Gina is now in charge of the CIA.
There's this situation going on with and I work for Sputnik, but I work for Sputnik because I never bought into the Russian narrative.
I'm watching what's unfolding in England right now.
It's if this if this is Russia who did that, it's the worst spy tradecraft I've ever seen in my life.
So it's obviously a false flag. We got to go to Bratley Strait and you finish up without we come back.
But I want to give you the floor to try to roll through.
Yeah, exactly because we've got lawyers and people looking at what was said in the videos and the radio versus what they put.
And it's the complaint. The lawsuit is the defamation. We'll be back. Michael ZX is back.

It's available.
The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard. That means it's clean. That means it's pure.

You know I always got accused of working for the CIA or working for some other agency and I'm really proud of the fact that I didn't.
And I built InfoWars with our listeners and with ratings and with success and with being on over 200 radio stations.
People have a private jet. They got a couple houses. I don't have the private jet. I don't have the mansion.
In fact my house is four bedroom and it's almost too big for me. I'm sick of it. I like living in the kitchen in the bedroom.
And I guess like the extra bedrooms is a place where the cat goes to crap on the bed.
But the point, I walk in there and I'm cleaning the house this morning and picking up stuff and I'm like, why the cat crap on the bed?
You know, I know my daughter wants a damn cat. I like cats except they do stuff like that. And it likes me so it peed on my shoes last week.
But I'm digressing. The point is, is we built InfoWars, ladies and gentlemen, with your help and everything you've done.
You are the InfoWars. And Lee's, you know, been around Austin 15 years ago and I was up in there 23 years.
And so I get this. I've been fired. I've been physically attacked. I understand we're winning.
When you have the globalist funded, Vatican funded, State Department controlled, CIA controlled.
Georgetown suing us, unprecedented, the main CIA school. And then they're saying we're being sued because we said this guy that's with the State Department worked for Hillary should be looked at as CIA.
But that shows novice understanding. The State Department runs the CIA. It runs everything.
That's why they just put Pompeo in there and got rid of Tillerson.
We're going to talk to Stranahan about that who's been sued a little bit in the next hour with myself and Paul Watson.
But briefly, listen, I'm confident because I believe in you. And I'm not just saying that I've seen you come through again and again.
And I prayed really hard last night. And I'll do this act like some big goody tissue guy. I really pray and it's like, I knew the jury was going to be 50-50 and take my kids part of the time.
And when I prayed that morning, I knew it was going to happen. And I knew when I prayed last night for about an hour straight, I just knew we're going to win.
This is going to blow up in their face. This is going to be huge. Call it your gut, your instinct, spiritual, whatever. My gut's never wrong.
If we execute properly, I know if we're strong, we're steadfast, we will win. It's going to be rough.
But then I know there's even bigger channels coming. So we sell really good products that we know are documented to be good for you and your family.
It's not just the bad bacteria in the gut because of all the pesticides and stuff. Probiotics are amazing.
I have a lot of friends who were in the military for decades and they almost all have irritable bowel or real problems from the bad food and not, you know, having probiotics.
And I said, listen, there's not going to the VA and having all your problems. Two people I know personally, I said, take our probiotic.
And within a month, they said, my God, I'm totally regulating everything. It's great. This changed my life.
But they both also lost a bunch of weight after because they had inflammation.
That's what this stuff does, ladies and gentlemen, but that's probiotic. This is what hits the yeast, the mold, the candida, all that.
Myco ZX Plus, now even stronger and a lower price.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's $27 right now. That's 50% off. Big glass bottle, four big regimens of it. Do it every few months.
It's just really powerful. InfoWarsTour.com, InfoWarsLive.com, and if you'll all, it also made me feel good this morning when I, Tim Frosier, texted me the amount of orders that came in yesterday and it was substantive.
People are, we just keep doing that. Soros and all these jerks can't stand against us. So InfoWarsTour.com or AAA-253-3139.
CitizenTournalistSchool.com, Lee Stranahan, you were getting into the whole latest debacle with the England-Wing War with Russia because the Russians nerve-gassed some spy.
It's completely obvious, but before we go there, just get into the lawsuit. When you found out it was happening, I knew days ago, but I didn't want to call you.
I guess you were figuring out yourself because the media was calling, not telling us what it was, trying to get evidence for them.
I mean, you watch all them working in collusion. It just shows you how nasty this deep state is.
Well, and I think it's very clear that some people, look, I've covered stuff. I was talking to one of your texts about Bill Browder.
He's one of the guys behind the Russiagate narrative. The reason I mentioned him is he said something a few years ago.
This guy's testified in front of the Senate and everything else. He understands that not all lawsuits are filed because you think you're going to win them.
Does that make sense? No, they're filed for PR purposes. That's exactly right. Some people file lawsuits to win them.
And some people file lawsuits because here's the thing, Alex, I can't debate.
If I come out and say something false about you to cause you harm, as a reporter, I can be sued for defamation.
But if I put it in a lawsuit and every news outlet picks it up, simple example.
It's protected because it's a legal document from libel and defamation. That's what I said.
It's designed, it's went to break room on the same page. This is designed to defame us.
That's right. Well, specifically, it says the defendants, that includes me, supported the Unite the Right Rally.
I did not support the Unite the Right Rally.
By the way, I didn't either. They got mad at me because I said I'm new right or libertarian. I called a bunch of these people idiots.
Yes. Well, and it also said, and anybody who follows me on Twitter, it also says that the defendants promoted Pizzagate.
I've been on the record adamant before the election. I never bought into the Pizzagate.
So they've defamed you in the document. The good news is news reports about it, though.
And when they commentate, then you've got the lawsuit and now you're rhyming.
I've told all these people and I've warned them. I've got to sue them now, but go ahead.
Well, no, you're exactly right. And look, the other thing here, Alex, is that I had made my living for 10 years as a reporter on big stories.
Like I went to Libya. I mean, forgive me. I went to a Beirut in 2013 to report on the Syrian refugee crisis, right?
When no one, I didn't see anybody else in the media over there. I was interviewing people from refugees to UN people.
I remember. No.
All right, Skype just broke up. We'll go back to least right of hand here in just a moment.
I mean, this, by the way, he's very careful. If you go see the Lee and Macadoob.
In fact, I forgot the name of the headline. It's in the suit, but they distorted it.
I got over here somewhere. Here's, here's Reuters when they were sending me fake headlines.
I went and checked. It wasn't even our headlines. Let me find it right here.
It was bombshell connection between Charlottesville Soros and they cut chaos off.
And then again, they edited this bombshell connection towards Soros needs to be charged and arrested for sedition and causing Charlottesville chaos.
And I have all the documents here where he funds Antifa. So again, they've edited all this. It's, it's amazing.
We're getting at least right of hand back on a Skype one out. But that's it.
Let's see. We're letting us out of the bag because they think we're stupid.
When they run their mouths, which they're already doing outside of that court with the stuff they're saying, they're going to get sued.
And like I said, I got Tom Brokaw saying that I'm an unalloyed racist, which means a committed 100% racist.
We got me protesting the KKK. We've got, you know, at my sister's Korean adopted, you know, my, my, my ex-wife's part Jewish and some makes my kids.
I mean, I guess the Nazis are right. My kids, I guess might be able to go, I think to go to Israel or whatever.
I mean, I didn't ever thought of that. But yeah, that hurt me. I mean, that did because then they use that.
They say that people want to attack me in airports because of it.
And I've got a few more months with the statutes to sue him. And so I'm sitting with the lawyers.
We have a whole office war room with the suits against us, the suits.
We've got pictures of who's funding them. I mean, it's like a movie, all can, like an FBI, you know, investigation room.
And we got the lawyers on it and we're tracking and it just, we've got, we've gotten six of the lawsuits to put them to drop them because they saw what we had, what we were going to do.
And they're like, oh, wow, you know how to sue us. And they found out the damages. So they've been dropping them.
But Georgetown University and George Soros and the Vatican and taxpayer money. I mean, this is next level.
And my lawyer said he's never seen anything like it. So this is just crazy.
And they think you're cowards. They think, oh, run from Alex Jones. He's getting sued. We're taking the country back.
Our forebears had to dodge bullets and get shot and, you know, go through all of this.
So, yeah, folks have been finding videos that I didn't even produce that other people shot of us protesting the KKK because I lost those tapes.
I had a flood in my garage. I kept a bunch of old tapes in my garage and it flooded one time when I was out of town and it just ruined all the VHS tapes.
And now I didn't even know this was I didn't even know the Austin protest was, oh my God, they found it. Wow.
That's great. I know I haven't seen this in like 20 years, 19 years. Wow. Alex Jones 1999 confronts the KKK.
Oh, that's in Waco. I guess it's the full one though. Not our footage.
And I did recently see the one in Austin's online. Somebody else videotaped that.
And the KKK said they were going to kill me and I told them F off.
And then the cops grabbed me and I'm always hearing cops are really KKK and it's not true.
But in Waco, the guy goes, my second memory means I can blow you the hell away and he was a federal agent when he came out of federal operative.
That's what I was saying. And I said, I said, you need to do something. The cops said shut up and like, you know, said some other stuff.
I wasn't on tape. So I'm going to repeat it. But we'll see if we can at least try to hand back on.
But this is a big time to be alive. Fourth hour. Paul Watson coming up and so much more.
Trump is trading the swamp. Trump is delivering. He's not perfect, but I can't believe he's gotten this much done. It's incredible.
Please don't forget new specials have been launched and you just shopping at great products you need at great prices.
The people are our greatest ally. If you stand with us, we won't be defeated. But if you don't, we will be crushed by the enemy. We need your help.
Mike and Arizona are on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
And as a longtime Infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans. The super blue is awesome.
And thank you so much, Alex, for the Infowars Life products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy. Absolutely.
Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on. And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
One of them is a powerful pro digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better. And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in fluorolife advanced restoration.
And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable fluorolife everyday maintenance. But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price. When you purchase it at m4store.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
All right, Paul Watson is getting in the cockpit there in London. We've got a lot to talk about with him. I'm going to ride shotgun the next two segments with him and Lee Stranahan the investigative journalist who is crystal clear now.
He restarted his computer via Skype citizenjournalismschool.com. Let's go back to this. We're not Gonzo journalism. We don't want to make the shows about us. Believe me, I had stacks of stuff ready here.
But Lee Stranahan shows how smart he is. And I don't just say that. Most people don't get, these lawsuits are PR stunts to say we're fake news and say lies about us.
Because if you're in divorce court or anything, somebody can come in and say, you know, I watched him murder 15 penguins after he raped them and he flew around the room in a Santa Claus suit.
None of it's true. It's defamatory, but you can say it in court. And that's what they've done. And they've used some guy that goes, yeah, I worked for a Congress when they got Soros money.
Yeah, I was in the State Department in Africa. Yeah, I worked for Hillary Clinton, but they say I staged the whole thing. And we didn't say that.
We said, you're a political and you became a spokesperson. And they should be investigated. And they're sick of us getting in the middle of their narratives.
So it is quite a time to be alive. And I love Skype. Lee Stranahan's things gone down three times as a strike. We'll get him back on.
I think it's our equipment in here because I'm the other studio Skype doesn't have any problems. And I keep noticing that. I don't know.
I think we have too much redundant stuff in the chain. I want to go raw. I want to cut down. We got too much fandangled fancy pansies in here.
And I think that's what's going on. I think it's a regular Skype connection works better in these big computerized special Skype box.
We bought like three years ago. That's like 18 million years ago now.
Paul Joseph Watson, though, is working with this guy from London, England. Paul, what do you make of them jumping the shark?
I think I talked to lawyers. They've never heard of a university publicly funded. They say they're private. They're really publicly funded.
CIA base suing us and then putting a bunch of fake stuff in the complaint. I mean, Paul, this is one of the biggest stories in the world right now.
Suing Alan West, former Congressman, Army Colonel, suing everybody else. What in the Hades is going on?
Well, yeah, I've read the Gateway Pundit breakdown about this. I haven't read the actual suit, but they break it down in what they're claiming.
And yeah, obviously he worked for the State Department. I mean, that's a proven fact. That's what we pointed out.
We were talking about the media narrative behind Charlottesville. Of course, we've never advocated violence in any form whatsoever. Everybody.
Oh, they say we're pro pro alt right a Hillary term, which a lot of people that call themselves that aren't bad, but some of them are white supremacists.
We said they were bad on that side and on the other. They say, Paul, we are that they just defamed us.
No, I can literally make videos attacking the alt right. They're in my DMs every day insulting me. I can put anti alt right on a Twitter profile.
Doesn't matter. Everyone's alt right. Everyone right of Chairman Maui's alt right at this point. And this whole process, Alex, is, you know, it's just again, the consequence of resentment and vindictiveness over losing an election.
It's like almost every day now, as you talked about yesterday, you wake up. Oh, our channel's about to be banned. Oh, this video has been censored. We have to fight back against that.
Oh, CNN's targeting our sponsors. Oh, they call us fake news blues. Oh, we're being sued for conspiracy theories. Translate, CitiCon, ban free speech in America of conservatives.
Yeah, you see, politics used to work like, okay, I advocate these principles for making society better. I advocate these policies. You advocate these policies and these principles.
Let's have an argument. Let's have a conversation and the voter will decide. Now it's just, no, we're going to sue you. We're going to target your sponsors. We're going to call you alt right.
We're going to demean you. We're going to character assassinate you. They can't beat us at the game as it was five, 10 years ago.
So now it's just completely underhanded, completely trying to sub everything we do. And again, they're lashing out with yet another frivolous lawsuit.
I mean, he worked for the State Department. It's a proven fact. He was a political activist. That's a fact.
They removed his name when we first pointed it out and they denied a bunch of it. Then later he admitted it all. This is insane.
Let's talk to him. He's also named a suit and Paul Watson will take over from her Britannic Magistrate of London, where Sadiq Khan, the Islamist's rules with impunity and brings in jihadis on a daily basis in between the time spent in Austin, Texas, calling for my show to be banned. We'll be back.
I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers. Non-GMO made right here in America 120 capsules.
And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing.
Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase of the operation.
Hi, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live with Paul Joseph Watson and working on Lee Stranahan's skype. He's frozen, but we'll still get his audio.
Paul, where do you think this is going next? And now we've got the removal here of Tillerson, who we know is playing ball with the globalist, his deputy.
Just overall, what's the big world view on what's happening right now?
Well, in terms of the election, Hillary Clinton is the greatest ally Donald Trump can ever have. I've got this clip which they're going to play later where basically she says, oh, but I'm the top candidate amongst the highest GDP areas on both coasts.
I'm the best candidate. She's brazenly admitting that nobody in those Rust Belt areas in the areas which Trump beat her likes her. And she's saying that that's a good strategy to continue to ignore those people in 2018 and in 2020.
And they say they hate flyover country. They say they hurt Christians. They're telling all the white, black, Hispanic, you name it, folks in the Rust Belt, you don't frickin' matter because you don't have a high GDP.
Yeah, it's just supreme arrogance and idiocy. I mean, she's the best friend the Trump campaign can have in 2020. She's falling downstairs again.
Now, remember CNN told us that Trump was physically unfit, told us that he was deranged. It was completely proven otherwise, yet they continue to do it.
The same people who said questioning her health was a conspiracy theory. She's got two guys holding her up at the end of that clip, and she's still stumbling and falling down.
And apparently now she's got some kind of hand injury as well that she's being treated for. So we were proven completely right again, but yet they still claim, oh, this was part of the Russian bot conspiracy network to claim Hillary was sick while she was hacking away through every speech.
Well, you know, the word is she wasn't falling down in India. She was just dancing like Trudeau, Canada.
Exactly. So again, they called us every name under the sun for pointing out basic reality that she was obviously ill, then took their own conspiracy theory said Trump was sick.
That was proven completely false, and yet they still continued to do it. That's why everyone hates CNN. That's why they're collapsing.
And Paul, they also say that Trump didn't really want to win the election. That's why he's announced 900 plus days early and has a new slogan, Keep America Great, and is in absolute ecstasy winning.
It's incredible. Also, with this Tillerson thing, Nancy Pelosi's came out today and basically said that he was fired because he stood up to Russia that Tillerson was fired because he stood up to Russia, which is interesting because when Tillerson was nominated back in 2016,
Pelosi came out with another statement and basically said Tillerson was a Russian agent. So he's a Russian agent when he gets nominated. When he gets fired, it's because he stood up against the Russians.
Well, that's because he got an ExxonMobil deal, which we should be trying to get the resources out of Russia. That helps everybody. They got more resources than the other nation or continent, you know, Eurasia.
And we need all that. And Tillerson got a big award for bringing industry to Russia. They're free market. They're Christian. We should be doing business with them.
Exactly. And now they're saying that he, other commentators like David Korn are saying that he was fired because of his comments about Russia yesterday. Okay. He was told he was going to be fired on Friday.
It was before he made any comments about Russia. But literally everything has to be fed into this Russia.
And there's only been one minute of coverage on the news that the house said no Russian collusion, but evidence of Hillary collusion. Let's bring in Lee Stranahan here. It was having some Skype problems. He's on phone now.
Lee, we're all under attack. Paul's being sued by extension. Lee Ann McAdoo is our reporter. You are. But I got to say again, the video of you and Lee Ann, we've already had it reviewed by legal folks.
It's total journalism. It's just insane. So again, I agree with you. I think this is a PR stunt. The problem is we can't let them keep doing the PR stunts.
That's why we're preparing lawsuits against all these people. And I'm not just saying that. I don't want to sue people. But what do we do next? What are other key points you want to tell folks?
Well, I think one of the big things here, one of the things I loved about the lawsuit was just seeing, it says the InfoWars is being sued through a company which is named Free Speech. What is it? Free Speech Systems.
Free Speech Systems. Yeah, so they're suing Free Speech.
I love that. I just, I love the irony of it that they're suing Free Speech.
You know when I named the company that, like 15 years ago when I incorporated, I did it in case it was ever a lawsuit. They'd be suing Free Speech.
No, I'm not surprised, Alex. I'm not surprised. I mean, because this is the thing. And Paul makes a great point. And by the way, Hi, Paul.
What's going on here is the revolution started in 2007. Two things happened in 2007. The markets collapsed and everybody realized that they've been buying into things.
And out of that, you got Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party Movement. But the other thing that happened was the iPhone was released.
And the reason that's significant is they know in the media right now that we, the citizens, don't actually meet them anymore.
People can actually make up their own minds from a buffet of ideas.
And the fact that people are getting their information from InfoWars, who is one of the only news outlets who, including outlets on the right, I will say this,
including outlets broadly on the right that will actually report on what the CIA, for instance, has been up to, right?
Because a lot of right outlets don't want to touch that with a 10-foot pole, and you've been great on that.
It's frightening them. And what they've done is they've exposed themselves for who they really are.
They are desperately afraid that people will figure out that, I said this on my radio show this morning, we're watching with this thing in England right now.
A real-time Gulf of Tonkin. The Gulf of Tonkin, how long did it take for people to figure out they'd been like for 40 years?
Right now. Right now, people are able to look at the data and go, you know, there's something weird about that.
Exactly. Gulf of Tonkin took 45, 50 years till it was declassified. Now we figure it out in days.
That's right. And it is a race. And the elites are aware of this. It is a race to see whether they can shut down free media.
And this is why we're seeing Twitter, Google. I've been told by people in Silicon Valley that they're under threat of antitrust.
Just ask yourself, Alex, remember the Microsoft suit in the 90s? Who's bigger? Google now or Microsoft in the 90s?
Google.
Answer is obvious. Right? Who's bigger? Amazon now or Microsoft now?
Amazon.
So they could be shut down today, right?
And you saw Trump's new campaign had warned them last week. What do you make of that?
Well, I've known Brad Parsdale for about 20 years. I used to work with him in San Antonio, actually, at a high tech company 20 years ago.
And I'm very happy to see Brad on there because Brad knows that he's very ambitious, he's very professional, but God bless him.
We're warning people. And this thing with you, you got two with two community standards strikes, correct? Is that what happened?
They did four and then they kept removing them. Yeah, exactly. But we're down to one.
I got three community standards strikes and they deleted my entire YouTube account. So I'm a little jealous, Alex.
But see, no, no, exactly. That's why I keep talking. We are came back as it was too obvious. They want to do all these fake suits and then ban us, but thousands of channels are still gone.
That's right. Yes. But the beauty of what you've done with info wars is they could take you down on YouTube tomorrow.
People would still be able to get info wars for a variety of means and YouTube wouldn't, which just wouldn't go through YouTube.
So this is what they're afraid of. And there's a real race going on.
I really believe this between the people who are promoting free speech and a marketplace of ideas. You don't have to believe me.
Sure. You disagree and free speech and Lee, Lee, you're right. I'm sure you saw the Microsoft CEO. I mean, not Microsoft.
They were talking about Microsoft. The news core CEO a month ago said this is the plan. They're going to set the president with us and everybody else.
This is them coming for the First Amendment. We need to talk more in the next week or so on air about the suit coordinating.
I love seeing you on David Knight during the morning. Lee Stranahan. Thank you so much.
CitizenJournalismSchool.com. Sorry about the problems today. We'll talk to you more.
Thanks, Alex. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Great points from Paul. I want to come back. I know you've got a full wrath and I'm begging Paul to do more than just an hour a week.
Everybody loves him so much and we need Paul. And Tommy Robinson is going to meet with him on Friday for a big interview they're going to do.
We're about to launch our London, UK, EU headquarters, which I've already got backing to do if Paul will take Excalibur from the stone.
Or I'm going to beat him upside the head with it, actually, if he doesn't take it out on the stone.

Paul Joseph Watson from the Frontlines of the Information War. It's Alex Jones.
Out of my way, out of my day, out of your mind and into my head. It's a known bond, it's a lifeboard, it's a young step but out of place.
They don't get it. The globalists are zero sum game. They believe the pie is only so big. They don't get that we know engaging them in combat.
When we have the high ground, it will only boost us. I ain't your bitch, globalist.
Alright Paul Watson, I want you to take over my friend. Please do more of the shows. Everybody loves the great work you're doing. I know you're writing so many great articles and being suppressed on YouTube and all the rest of it.
But this is an epic time to be alive and again, I've talked to very competent lawyers in DC, folks that have done a great job for us in the past.
They're highly connected and they say they've never seen anything like this. Georgetown, a government funded law school.
Because their law school is, he's government suing against the First Amendment to set a precedent to ban people. He got Sadiq Khan running around saying banish.
He got the Pope funding this lawsuit calling to ban conservative voices. This is next level and I know we've been harping on this but this is the big issue.
The NRA got record donations when they tried to take their sponsors and shut them down. That's great. I support it.
We've gotten some extra and I felt better after yesterday because like $100,000 extra came in.
But we were discounting things so much. Okay, we sold $350,000 with a product made $100,000. That sounds like a lot, not when you got 12 Democrat party lawsuits on your ass.
And 100 crew members and satellites and everything else. That's a really good day though.
Most days we're making like $20,000, $30,000 to fund things. With all this, that just pays the bills.
But it's a war. People need to understand it's like, oh, they're suing again, we'll never win. No, you get excited, you buy toothpaste, you buy books, you buy videos, you buy t-shirts.
You sign up for auto ship, Michael ZX knocks out the really bad stuff in your gut, the whole slime wall that the fungus and mold again need to create.
That's 50% off new Michael ZX plus even stronger lower price.
Everything's about ratcheting up, buying more of a product, getting even higher quality, getting a lower price, passing it on to people.
You know, we get a better price on Michael ZX, even stronger, we lower the price.
But we need people to just understand it's a long distance battle.
So Paul, I'm going to let you take over. Love you to death. Told your meeting with Mr. Robinson on Friday for a big interview. That's correct, right?
I don't know anything about that, but we can talk about it after the show.
Okay, well, see, I'm talking to him and he keeps saying he's going to go meet you. He's running around off in Canterbury or somewhere right now.
But we need to get you guys together because we have the funds to launch the UK operations. Remember?
We'll set it up. Yeah, we'll talk about it.
Well, Paul, here's the deal. We must blow up the Death Star.
So, I mean, all I'm saying is we're kind of wargaming live here on air.
Okay, fine. Tommy said, I'm going to see him on Friday. It's set up.
So you start talking. I'm going to call Tommy right now on air.
I'm going to put him on air with his speakerphone. Go ahead.
Yeah, what Tommy's been talking about and what I've been talking about today, Alex, last week, last weekend, the weekend just gone, there was a women's march in London.
Now, what they were marching about, God only knows, they weren't marching up against the Saudi Arabian embassy or the Qatari embassy or anywhere like that.
Against, you know, countries where women are still treated as second class citizens.
They were marching for women's rights in London.
Now, in the UK, women have exactly the same rights as men.
There's nothing to protest about in the West.
Feminism has achieved its objective.
Now, it's just about regressive leftism.
So there was a big women's march in London.
I've been asking today where people can point me to details of this coming weekend's feminist march against the industrial level abuse of over 1000 young girls in a town called Telford in the UK.
1000 young girls drugged, abducted, raped, tortured, in one case, killed.
Now, this wasn't an overnight thing.
This went on for 40 plus years.
And our main broadcaster, the BBC, it took them well over 24 hours to even talk about it.
They had one story up on their website yesterday when people started calling them out for it.
It was like a local story buried between two other non-issue stories.
So the main broadcaster refused to even talk about it before they got so much pressure.
And where are the feminist marches, where are the women marching against the industrial level abuse of young women and children in some cases, in not just Telford, but in Rotherham, in Oxford, in all these different towns.
And once again, it comes back to political correctness.
People say, oh, political correctness is just being nice to people.
It's just being nice to people.
No, it isn't.
It kills.
Abuse.
Why?
Because once again, just like Rotherham, the police, the social services, refused to properly investigate this scandal, this four decade long scandal, refused to properly investigate it, disbelieved the victims in some cases, refused to prosecute the culprits in some cases.
Why?
Because they feared being called racist.
The exact same story we heard in Rotherham, the exact same story we heard in Oxford.
So now you've got journalists visiting Telford, just turning up and talking to people living there, and they're saying that they were embroiled with it.
There was one journalist who works for Westminster, I think, who said, out of the eight people he talked to, like half of them were embroiled in this scandal, in this one little town.
Either, you know, they had a rally.
So let's be clear, the giant dam is breaking, and anybody can go with a camera to any British town and ask about the Muslims kidnapping the women and raping them, that no one will stop them.
Because Matt Stockham's syndrome, the dam is breaking, it's coming out of the BBC everywhere, 4,000 in this town, 1,000 in this town, 800 in this town.
What a girl found dead, a girl shipped overseas.
What are they going to do as this scandal implodes and collapses?
And surprise, surprise, the Muslims are setting up harems again of kidnapped women. I mean, it's what they do, it's a cult of kidnapping, raping and enslaving women.
Well, it's interesting because the original Sunday Mirror Exposé on this did not mention anything to do with their faith.
They said they were from Pakistan, they were from Bangladesh, they were from Muslim-majority countries, but they didn't say they were Muslim, because we have a law in this country.
I think it's the 2006 Religious Race Relations Act, something like that, it's the 2006 law, which basically is a blasphemy law, which says you can't discriminate or even criticize a belief system, because again, they treat Islam as if it's a race.
So the very newspaper that did the massive expose on this refused to even point out their belief system and the fact that this is a culture which, you know, they come from a culture which treats women and girls as second-class citizens.
They can't even make that point because it would put them under likelihood of criminal prosecution.
We had a Lord stand up in the House of Lords today or yesterday who made the connection and just asked the basic question, can we criticize the religion of Islam or is that a hate crime?
I think we need that question solidly, firmly cleared up.
Given what happened to Lauren Southern and Brittany Pettibone, Lauren was basically banned from the country for handing out a pro-gay rights leaflet that said, quote, Ella is a gay god.
Okay, that's why she was banned.

You're back. It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show on this March 13th edition.
Now, of course, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has essentially been fired by Donald Trump.
You're fired because of his stance on Iran, mainly, but of course the media is turning this into the narrative of constant chaos at the White House.
But they're also spinning a conspiracy theory that Tillerson was fired because he stood up against Russia.
Again, they're tying literally everything into this Russian derangement syndrome that has taken hold.
Daily caller headline, reporters immediately blame Tillerson firing on Russia comments.
There's just one problem.
Rex Tillerson is out as Secretary of State leading many establishment journalists to falsely claim that his recent comments on Russia allegedly poisoning a spy in the United Kingdom are responsible.
Now, of course, this whole poisoning scandal in the United Kingdom is still up in the air.
There's been no actual full investigation into it.
People have pointed out the fact that this ex-Russian spy double agent was retired.
He wasn't even active. He was living a quiet life.
It would not benefit Russia in any way to take him out.
As a petty form of revenge, it would have so much blowback, it would not be worth it.
Of course, Russia is denying any involvement.
There hasn't been a proper investigation.
But the Washington Post report on Tillerson's departure Tuesday morning, Tillerson commented on Monday that Sergei Skripal and ex-Russian spy poisoning the UK last week appears to be clearly an act of the Kremlin.
So Tillerson said that on Monday.
And then today, a lot of talking heads on the left came out and said that that was the reason he was fired.
An example being David Korn, who said Tillerson says Russia clearly involved in poisoning a former Russian spy in the UK.
Trump fires Tillerson hashtag just saying this is complete bunk because as the article points out, Tillerson was actually asked to leave last Friday.
According to that same Washington Post article, meaning he was fired before, before his comment on Russia.
But literally every opportunity they get, they will tie it into Russia.
It truly is Russian derangement syndrome.
And this extends to Nancy Pelosi, who can barely give a speech now without stuttering and stammering as we played the videos many times on this show.
Now, if you go on my Twitter page and scroll down a little bit, I've posted the statements of Nancy Pelosi, both when Tillerson was nominated as Secretary of State and when he was fired today.
Now, this is interesting because you will know somewhat of a contradiction here.
So this is from the official statement, the press release, when Tillerson was first nominated back in, I think, December 2016 for Secretary of State.
Nancy Pelosi said, quote, our nation has always needed a wise and experienced Secretary of State who has the judgment and skill to protect our national security, strengthen our alliances and advocate for human rights.
And you see the tweet there, it's the image on the left below.
This is the statement she made when he was nominated, choosing an oil executive friendly with Vladimir Putin as Secretary of State sends a disturbing signal about President-elect Trump's priorities.
It goes on to say Rex Tillerson's cozy relationship with the Kremlin is especially alarming in light of his attitude towards sanctions over Russia's aggressive behavior in Europe.
So Nancy Pelosi was out on the day of Tillerson's nomination, basically accusing him of being a Russian agent or at least being in bed with the Russians, sympathetic to the Russians.
Compare that to Nancy Pelosi's statement today when Tillerson was fired.
Now, because we know why he was fired, it's because they fundamentally disagreed over Iran.
There were problems with the trade negotiations, there were problems potentially in the future with the North Korean negotiation.
But this is what Nancy Pelosi said today about the statement of, about the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, quote.
Secretary Tillerson's firing sets a profoundly disturbing precedent in which standing up for our allies against Russian aggression is grounds for a humiliating dismissal.
President Trump's actions show that every official in his administration is at the mercy of his personal whims and his worship of Putin.
So she's basically trying to argue that Tillerson was fired because he stood up against Russia.
Even though we know, as I just explained, he was fired, de facto fired on Friday, he was sold about it on Friday.
It was announced today before Tillerson made the comments about Russia.
So on the one hand Pelosi, on the day he was nominated says he's a Russian agent.
This is horrible. This just proves the collusion conspiracy.
Once again, on the day he was fired, it proves that Trump is firing people who stand up against Russian aggression, Russian collusion.
So again, everything is Russia, everything is tied into Russian derangement syndrome.
Even if those two statements completely contradict each other, she still put out a statement asserting that he was fired because he stood up against Russia.
Absolutely clear, clear example of how this whole Russian collusion conspiracy is complete bonkham and is being used as a political witch hunt to undermine the Trump administration once again.
We see it with the firing of Rex Tillerson.
Now, Hillary Clinton has been making headlines once again.
And as I said on Twitter, that's a good thing.
Every effort possible should be made to ensure Hillary has a vocal platform right up until 2020 because everything that comes out of her mouth is completely imbecilic, is completely arrogant and completely strikes at the root of why she lost in the first place.
I mean, she's Trump's biggest and best cheerleader for 2020. We need to keep her prominent on that platform because everything that comes out of her mouth helps Trump immeasurably.
So we've got this video clip now where she's talking about why she resonated with people on the east and west coast and how that relates to GDP.
Let's go to the Hillary clip right now. Here it is.
There you have the clip.
There's all that red in the middle where Trump won.
I win the coast. I win, you know, Illinois and Minnesota places like that.
But what the map doesn't show you is that I won the places that represent two-thirds of America's gross domestic product.
So I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward, and his whole campaign, Make America Great Again, was looking backwards.
So again, there is Hillary Clinton brazenly admitting to the fact that she only resonated with the bicoastal elites, that she paid no attention whatsoever to the rust belt to Wisconsin, to Michigan.
The very places where she lost the election.
See, she can't help let her arrogance, her disdain for flyover country slip out at every available opportunity.
And the audience applauses it.
She's like, this is why I lost because I don't resonate with actual hardworking Americans who have been impoverished because of globalism.
And she's making that out as if it's a good thing.
No, you complete idiot.
That's why you lost.
That's why Democrats are going to lose again if they don't have an actual economic platform for 2020 that resonates with Americans in those rust belt areas.
The ones who voted for Trump, the ones who are now getting their jobs back.
We saw a steel plant, I think it was in Pennsylvania last week, opening 500 Americans getting jobs because of that.
You don't resonate with those people.
That's why you lost the election because you campaigned online, you failed to even go out there because you were too busy coughing, hacking, collapsing and sleeping.
But the very fact that it still comes out of her mouth and she can barely hide her supreme arrogance again just tells you everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton and the machine that surrounds her.
There you see again, stumbling down the stairs.
Shouldn't really laugh at somebody's disability or their illness.
But when the media tells us where conspiracy theorists for even pointing to reality and saying that obviously she's got complications, problems from prior illnesses that made their way very viscerally, very visually into the 2016 election campaign.
And they called us conspiracy theorists, then they went on this whole rag for the past six months about how Trump was deranged, about how he was physically unfit, drinking too many Diet Cokes.
He has his physical assessment, he has his mental assessment, absolutely perfect and yet Delta and all the rest of them at CNN still insisted he was physically unfit.
But where reckless conspiracy theorists for saying the same about Hillary, even as she's coughing, even as she's falling and fainting.
Absolutely incredible, we'll be back on the Alex Jones Show Live breaking news at Infowars.com.

We are back for the final segment of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show. Did you know that saying I'm not racist is racist?
That's right. According to the University of California headline University of California guide saying I'm not racist is racist.
They've put out this list of microaggressions. Of course, microaggressions is basically an absolutely pedantic list of verbal, non-verbal environmental slights.
These are their words, snubs or insults, whether intentional or unintentional. You could not even be aware that you're doing them, but communicate hostile, derogatory or negative messages to target persons.
Now they've got a list of them which is up on their official website and we've seen this before from other universities.
They actually list on there telling someone you speak English very well that's racist. Can't compliment somebody on their English if they're a foreign student that's racist now.
Telling an Asian person they get at math that's racist. Insisting America is a melting pot. See there's this whole area about saying if you say, oh, I don't see race.
I see America as a melting pot. So even if you parrot some of these multicultural cliches, no, that's not good enough. You're still racist.
And they actually have the phrase, I'm not racist. I have several black friends listed as an example of racism. Absolutely incredible.
Other examples include there's only one race, the human race. So basically, you know, reciting the lyrics to John Lennon's Imagine now makes you a racist.
I believe the most qualified person should get the job. That's racist.
Believing in a meritocracy, which is how the whole Western world works is now racist.
Thinking that America is the land of opportunity. That's literally a quote.
If you say America is the land of opportunity, again, for all racists, regardless of color or creed, no, that's racist. I can't say that anymore.
They also say a white woman who clutches her purse or bag when approached by a black or Latino person is also committing a racist microaggression.
Not because those people are overrepresented in crime statistics. No, it's because the woman is racist.
Asking nonwhite people why they're being quiet or loud. That's racist.
So you can't even ask why people have behaving in a certain way, whether it that's positive or negative. That's racist.
And again, it harkens back to these other articles that we did, including one out of the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee.
And they literally launched a campaign in 2015 where they claimed that using the term politically correct.
So just saying the term politically correct in a pejorative way, in a negative way, was a microaggression, was essentially racist.
There was also the University of New Hampshire's bias free language guide, which asserted that the word American.
American, the word American is problematic because it assumes the US is the only country inside the continents of North and South America.
So you can't use the word American.
You also can't use the words and phrases, obese, normal, mothering, fathering, homosexual, illegal alien and senior citizens because they might offend someone somewhere.
Now, of course, the goal of all this is to police language, is to get those parameters of acceptable speech.
And by this very definition, acceptable thought, strict, constricted to the point where everybody's walking on eggshells before they say anything.
They live in absolute fear of offending anybody because of these constrictive language guides that literally act to control people's thoughts.
This is what's going on in our universities.
Little surprise, then, that this survey, which just came out, Survey Democratic, Democrat college students say inclusivity more important than free speech.
They basically asked them if diversity and inclusivity should take precedence over free speech.
And the overwhelming majority of Democrats favored protecting feelings over free speech.
They literally think protecting people's fee fees is more important than the fundamental bedrock of American freedom.
And we wonder why we see Antifa at all these colleges, all these universities literally holding up signs that say free speech crossed out and burning them and trashing them.
Is it any wonder? Absolutely incredible.
Now, I talked about this at the start of the show with Alex. We had a woman's march in London last weekend for what reason God only knows because women in the UK have exactly the same rights as men.
They have a lot more protections in terms of care, in terms of abuse, in terms of psychological trauma support than men.
But no, that's not enough, apparently.
So there was a women's march for no particular purpose. There's no gender pay gap. It doesn't exist.
It doesn't account for the fact that men work more hours, but they had a march anyway.
Now, I've been trying to find details and I just can't seem to pin them down of the feminist march this coming weekend against the industrial level abuse of over 1,000 young girls for a period of over 40 years,
40 years in Telford, which is a town in England. Now, you would think that feminists support the right of young girls to not be drugged, to not be abducted, to not be raped, to not be abused in one case, to not be killed.
You would think that that would be an important women's rights issue, especially given the fact that it's not just this one case, that we've literally had probably a dozen of these cases over the past few years,
where we have the industrial level abuse of young girls by Muslim grooming gangs.
And in the Daily Mirror Sorry expose of this, which came out on Sunday, they couldn't even mention the fact that they were Muslim.
They said they were Bangladeshi, Pakistan. Of course, we know what those people have in common.
This is a massive problem, but a major national newspaper is afraid to even use certain language because we have de facto blasphemy laws in this country,
which prevent us from even talking about it in many cases.
Tory MP reports Breitbart BBC not standing up for white working class after ignoring Telford scandal.
This is Lucy Allen MP, who said she was pushing to ask an urgent question in Parliament on Tuesday,
as well as revealing she'll be demanding an inquiry into the scandal.
Well, we know already why this scandal happened from the original early reporting is because social services, authorities and police were so petrified
of God forbid being called racist that they refused to properly investigate to properly prosecute the culprits.
So the BBC ignored this story for about 24 hours after it came out on Sunday.
It was the biggest story in the country by far. The BBC ignored it for about 24 hours.
They finally put out an article in like the local section of their website wasn't even on the front page.
They buried it beneath all these other articles.
The pressure that that causes finally prompted the BBC to give this top billing that it deserves.
But another example of how this is covered up, not just by the authorities, but by the media itself,
the leading media lights in the United Kingdom.
There's a Hill article report hundreds of girls raped and forced into prostitution in small English town,
which goes through the history of it. Absolutely incredible.
Where is the feminist March this weekend? That's my question.
You marched last weekend for no discernible reason.
Now we have yet another example of the industrial level abuse of young girls in one town in our country for 40 years.
One of many. Where's the March? Where's the protest?
Ain't going to happen because feminists don't give a damn about actual women's rights.
They don't give a damn about young girls being abused.
They only care about obtaining power because feminism has been hijacked as a far left crusade.
That's why there won't be any marches.
Let's head to Europe now for the latest in cultural enrichment news.
This is out of voice of Europe. Greek woman gang raped by migrants after visiting refugee solidarity event.
Refugees welcome a 23 year old Greek woman and her boyfriend relived scenes of horror in the court of Thessaloniki last week.
The woman was gang raped by three migrants from Syria and Algeria more than a year ago.
This happened in October 2016. It's just in court.
They actually went to a refugee solidarity event and right next to it, this woman was gang raped.
Absolutely incredible. You hear some of the stories that came out of Calais of similar circumstances where in many cases the volunteers who went there to help were the victims of this.
And then they actually didn't speak out about it because they were like, oh my God, I might be called racist.
I won't tell the police that I've just been gang raped.
Absolutely incredible. In Sweden, their government is encouraging actually spending millions to encourage migrant background citizens to vote in September election.
So Sweden's got a big September election coming up where it's basically their last chance to save their country.
And the current liberal lefty establishment government in charge is literally dropping nearly a million dollars in these no go suburbs of Sweden,
which we've all seen the horrible footage out of reporters being attacked, people being chased off, ambulance, fire, police being attacked.
They're dropping a million dollars in those areas to get those migrants to vote in the election.
The very same migrants who have created in many cases the soaring violent crime and parallel societies that have basically turned Sweden into a meme.
So the government of Sweden is paying money to destroy Sweden. Absolutely insane stories continue to pour out of Europe.
That's going to wrap it up though. Owen Shroy is coming up with The War Room. Don't go away.
He is their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia,
to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
