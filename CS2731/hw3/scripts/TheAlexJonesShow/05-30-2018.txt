We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the resistance.
Rallying Patriots worldwide.
We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
And finally, new rule.
Now that he's suing me for five million dollars because he says he's proved that he is not
the love child of an orangutan, Donald Trump must learn two things.
What a joke is and what a contract is.
Now, let me catch you up on how all this got started during the last week of the presidential
campaign.
That's good.
Now the big question here is obviously, will Bill Maher of real time be fired by HBO for
calling the president a racially insensitive term because you can pair someone with strawberry
blonde hair to an orangutan, you're being racist against white people for comparing them
to a primate.
But of course, Bill Maher should not be fired because you could argue that Donald Trump does
have orangutan colored orange hair, at least used to he did and it's more gray blonde now.
And it's a funny joke.
And when I saw it at the time, I thought it was funny.
I've called Trump the golden code, I've called myself a pumpkin head.
I have a very large head.
That said, this is the death of comedy.
It's the same thing that Seinfeld's talked about and many others, we can't even go on
universities anymore and tell basic jokes.
Remember Seinfeld's own 13 year old daughter, he said, we're going to move back from upstate
New York or ranch or farm back to the cities, you can meet more boys.
And his daughter said, dad, this is two years ago, that's sexist even say boy.
That's the cultural brainwashing.
That's the real authoritarianism here and you know, I'm gonna have a dog in the fight
for Roseanne Barb.
She's come on the show before she says she's a listener.
I think one of her personalities listens to the show.
I think Roseanne Barb obviously is on substance abuse.
A lot of people are.
They're not putting the lady down, but the point is, is that she's now coming out falling
on her sword apologizing, groveling, saying I was on Ambien, I had a bad experience.
She says that, you know, it's rough having seven personalities.
Roseanne Barb says she has seven personalities, whether it's true or not.
This whole show, I actually watched a few of the episodes and it's exactly what I thought
it was.
There was a lure libertarian and conservative viewers back in that have a bunch of Islamists
on the show and basically another Archie Bunker versus Meathead rerun to sit there and social
engineer people.
And as they added more and more political correctness in, people tuned out.
The show spiked up.
It was then sliding down, plunging into oblivion.
They activated their MKUltra, multiple personality operative, Roseanne Barb to then go into a
complete conniption fit.
That's really what I believe.
I believe that she is an MKUltra mind control slave, as many people in Hollywood are, and
that John Goodman is also a Martian robot.
I'm being sarcastic, but when she's over there saying, I got seven personalities and I'm
on tranquilizers, which might be true.
It certainly opens the door.
She says, I am large.
I contain multitudes.
Well, she has a personality that loves us, that says she's going to come on all the time
and then doesn't.
So maybe it's true or maybe she's just full of prunes.
Roseanne says having seven personalities is tough.
After issuing an apology, Roseanne Barb overnight slammed some of her former co-stars and retweeted
defenses over racist comments that prompted ABC to cancel her TV series.
Is it racist?
Is it racist if somebody looks semming and then humans are primates to say it?
I mean, I don't like to be a rillo in my shirt off.
No, it's not.
This is a political correctness.
Is it racist to target blacks for abortion?
Oh, yeah, that is.
Or to ship drugs in a neighborhood?
Oh, yeah, that is.
I don't know if we'll ever talk about that because they're the engineers.
By the way, China is threatening to start a war with the U.S.
We'll tell you about that when we come back.
I'm so excited.
The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim,
filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even
make the hormones in your glands.
It is amazing.
Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase of fuzzy operation.
Changing War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones.
Who is he?
He's an absolute total tool of Chuck Schumer, he's a tool of Chuck Schumer and of course
the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi.
This vicious gang has transformed once peaceful, beautiful communities that I know so well.
I know them all.
Into blood-stained killing fields, savagely murdering, raping, and mutilating their victims.
This is why we call the blood-thirsty MS-13 gang members exactly the name that I used
last week.
What was the name?
Animals.
But in the end, Mexico's paying for the wall.
They make all of this money and they do absolutely nothing to stop people from going through Mexico,
from Honduras and all these other countries, the caravan, all of this stuff.
They do nothing to help us, nothing.
They're going to pay for the wall and they're going to enjoy it, okay?
They're going to enjoy it.
The reason I opened the broadcast up with that today is the only place you'd see that
would be either on m4wars.com or drudgerport.com or Fox News.
It got blacked out all over the news with the Roseanne bar distractions.
A few leftist publications picked it up, but Mexico now has opened its border specifically
for people not to stay there, but to come here in a very aggressive military action.
The UN admits that they're using giant, collapsing Third World populations as weapons against
the West to fully make us capitulate to their form of government globalism, just like the
Tamarishi, famously in the 80s, shipped in over 10,000 homeless people into a tiny county
in Oregon so he could outvote and take over the county.
It's the same thing.
The Democrats admit it.
They've got 14 states letting illegal aliens get driver's license and vote.
The Democrats are now telling illegals to vote.
Nobody would put up with this.
So I opened the broadcast up that Trump is continuing to try to defend our republic.
He's pressuring the Democrats with very, very fair immigration deals to make it easier
to become a citizen, easier to come in if you're not a criminal, easier for people that
actually are real dreamers and have lived here for a long time and aren't criminals
that contribute to become citizens to be fast-tracked.
But if you're criminals or you're MS-13 or you've got serious convictions, you are going
to have your criminal, but whether you're from Europe or whether you're from Asia or
whether you're from Latin America thrown out of here, the media has branded controlling
our borders a Hispanic thing because that was the majority.
It's now Chinese women.
For three years running, Chinese women are the number one group here illegally week by
week and they come here to have their babies for free.
They fly in the last month, the government knows it, they get in a hotel, they go have
the baby, everything's paid for, and that baby's now a U.S. citizen and gets benefits
and it's middle-class Chinese doing it.
It's crazy, you go to the domain in North Austin and sometimes a third of the people
you'll see are pregnant Chinese women.
Don't speak a lick of English and they're up there, they're shopping, they're enjoying
themselves, they've got an apartment, they're right next to the big women's center that's
right down the road there where my wife just had her baby a year ago and they are milking
the systems.
There it is, China, now the biggest group.
So it's a joke.
It's a joke of China and you try that.
They will put you in a forced labor camp or they will execute you and they will take
your organs.
But see, just like the EU filing suit on thousands of U.S. companies claiming that we abuse
people's data, which in many cases is true, the EU basically exempts itself and China
hasn't had one suit filed on them.
It's China and the EU ganged up on us and I keep going back to that because how can
leftists not join with the fight for America?
When everything Trump's doing is pragmatically, Eisenhower meets JFK, it's just standard
turn the economy on, go after corruption, kick out most the lobbyists, nothing's perfect
and just follow an economic policy that's good for the country and good for the world
but not good for ultra-rich people worth hundreds of billions of dollars like Bezos
and Slim and Gates and Buffett and all the rest of these people, they are above the law
and they are at war with free economies and they are at war with the West because they
are monopoly men and they want total consolidation.
Trump is a renaissance guy, he's a capitalist, he is a entertainer, he is somebody that wants
large ass and wants big, juicy economies so he can skim off the top in a legal and lawful
way, not off some skimming to take it, you know, some business, riding in on the return
of America, a big hit, a big cornucopia, the ghost of Christmas present, big beautiful
orangutan but remember Bill Marr can call him an orangutan and Bill Marr is not going
to get his show cancelled but Roseanne Barr, you can see it, they set her up, brought in
the new show, was really an anti-conservative program, the pieces I saw of it, luring people
in, it's simply amazing, they can call George W. Bush a chimpanzee, a monkey, over and over
again, if you're a TV viewer we've got the meme on screen, let's go back to that, you
got Valerie Jarrett that doesn't completely look like the chimpanzee scientist lady from
the first excellent Charlton Heston Planet of the Apes movie, she looks more like a toad
or a snapping turtle, more like a fish creature, now Trump doesn't really look like an orangutan
other than the orangutan color of his hair, it's dead on back when he was just dying it
with just for men or whatever, reportedly that's what that color is, okay yes Trump
does make chimpanzee like or orangutan like lip faces because humans do that and they've
got studies how humans with the same emotions make the same faces as great apes, chimpanzees,
apes, orangutans, and you can see the comparisons they teach that in sociology, psychology, anthropology
it's well known, so if you compare some black lady to looking simian well there's a reason
because we are primates, that's why there's so many comparisons to humans and monkeys
and apes because some people look more like it than others, there are some white people
that look more like apes than other white people, there are some black people that look
more ape like other black people, I look ape like, with my shirt off, you know in my birthday
suit I look like a gorilla, I mean I have to work out, I've got big chest, big arms,
big legs, I'm bow legged, my feet are flat, my dad is somewhat simian looking too, it's
just the way it is and I'm proud of it, but I mean this whole thing is just absolutely
ridiculous, I'm hairy like an ape too, by the way I'm proud of it, women don't seem to
mind they seem to like it, so I would say that I look more simian than most black people,
but this mental illness of political correctness to say that we don't all at one way or another
look simian is just a complete joke, I mean it's like species of horses, does a mule look
a lot like a horse, even though it's not a horse, does a donkey look a lot like a horse,
it's a different species but it's in the same family, so if you're watching on TV you
can see that footage they did where I did a whole joke, the old I decided I supported
Hillary and I'm ripping my shirt off and I look simian there, but this is the mental
illness, this is what they've pushed, this is what they've said where they can decide
who's fired, who's taken off the air, then that sets the precedent monkey see monkey
do where then all of us are watching television and we think oh let's reenact that in our
own lives, it's incredible, I call my own little daughter my little monkey, she hangs
onto my fingers and you know what she looks like a cute little pink monkey, so this is
the mental illness ladies and gentlemen and it's out of control, so they're gonna fire
anybody that compares white people to apes, no it's not gonna happen, they'll be back
with Russia and China and major threats, I tried other brands but I came back to my

We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
We're going to get a different result out of hate, why don't we just try love, we have
the resources for a peaceful world, you know sometimes you need some crazy mother f**kers
to change something, Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all going to see Jobs phones, they
say trucks crazy, they say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love, it's a bigger plan
and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
I'm your host Alex Jones, coming up the next segment, I'm going to get into Senator Seek
stronger action on China in South China Sea, China is now threatening military action against
our ships, that means war, that is a huge issue, also Soros has thrown a big fit, everything
has gone wrong, Soros warns major financial crisis is coming when he's the one that's
famous for engineering financial crises and I'm also at the start of the next segment
going to air the definitive clip of Soros on NPR and Soros on 60 Minutes and other programs
saying the best time of his life was going around with his father while his stepfather
rounded up the Jews and now he feels no guilt for it and then he's attacking Roseanne Barr
for pointing it out and I think that's the real reason she got canned, now here's what
you really need to know about Roseanne Barr, Roseanne Barr is extremely, here's what you
need to know about Roseanne Barr, Roseanne Barr is extremely eccentric, Roseanne Barr
was basically picked by the corporate media who have imploding ratings to come on television
and launch a conservative quasi reboot but as soon as the show launched it began to just
be a sucker punch or a sucker play where they lured people back into the top rated show
to get viewers back into ABC and then they baited and switched it from the episodes
I watched and it had more social justice warrior stuff, it had more pro open border Islamic
crap than anything you could imagine so we praise it as this great conservative program
and this trailblazing thing when Roseanne is the token free thinker, she's the token
open minded person and then she's billed as a crazy person, she's billed as a substance
abuser, she's billed as a person with multiple personalities and so we hail mainstream media
and say thank you so much for giving us a voice in mainstream news and mainstream sitcoms,
that's right sitcoms, let us tune into your fraud and let us buy into it and let us feel
like we've got a seat at the table when all you're doing is laughing at us and suckering
us and then when Roseanne gets a little bit off the reservation you ignore it but as soon
as the ratings start to plunge from record ratings in the last four or five years for
any other show out there to only a decent show with a trajectory showing it going straight
down, well then the controversy you've been pushing her to engage in, well the last stage
of the setup was brought in and ABC bragged to see an end, an article I read this morning
that they were already looking at cancelling the show because of her activities and that
they were proud of how quick they took action and how they flushed her so quickly because
they're not going to put up with hate, they're going to virtue signal just like major Fortune
100 companies like Starbucks, Starbucks is admittedly being funded by the open society
foundation in George Soros that's the main funder of the PR group in their own press
release along with the Ford Foundation running the whole oh we're racist we're going to close
our doors for a few days to be a reeducation camp and then we're going to ask every white
patron that comes in are you a racist would you virtue signal today and tell a black person
you're sorry will you take on some guilt, this is being pushed as divide and conquer
from the people up on the top of the pyramid to control those at the bottom of the pyramid
it's simple it's in the WikiLeaks it's called social engineering it's called divide and
conquer it's called Balkanization now the truth about Roseanne Barr was as soon as she
made the statement she apologized because in the past they would let her apologize for
publicity but this time they were ready to get rid of her yeah there it is you're watching
on TV the Perception Institute research representation reality that means controlling reality and
who was one of their main funders Ford Foundation and the open society foundation that's all
divide and conquer race war garbage and so are the other organizations why are the ultra
rich why are the super blue bloods that only marry other white people who only allow Oprah
Winfrey into their eugenics meetings that are even in the Wall Street Journal in New
York Times remember six years ago the world's richest meeting secret to establish a world
government for depopulation just type in the world's richest meeting New York to discuss
depopulation ABC News London Guardian you name it six years ago they try to coming out they
said David Rockefeller Ted Turner Bill Gates they're all there with Oprah Winfrey the one
black lady meeting in secret in New York and then they put out a press release admitting
we're establishing world government and we're going to shrink your population and we're
going to teach you how to fight with each other and we're going to bring down the first
world because we shouldn't have a middle class only a super elite these guys all run global
scams where they pay basically zero taxes all their money tax exempt and they get called
philanthropist while they lecture all of us about how we're bad and how we shouldn't
have a middle class and they also work around the clock to shut down any small businesses
or any regional businesses or factories and deindustrialize the West to bring us to our
knees so they can dictate to us the terms of our total surrender and then once they've
got you under their control they can dictate inoculations they can dictate number of children
you can have they can dictate total control but first they're going to let the third
world population run rampant until we approve a global fascist order that will then exterminate
with race specific bio weapons the entire third world now that's the real plan and that's
why they hate me because I've reverse engineered their own documents their own admissions their
own plans now if you want to stop this and you want to fight back it is absolutely critical
that you understand what we're really dealing with here and you don't defeat these people
by apologizing or by groveling they want to bring in a total climate of witch hunt and
fear where we all roll over you want to stop them you spread the word you tell the truth
you don't care if you get criticized sharing a news wars dot com link you don't care if

life dot com or call one eight eight eight two five three three one three nine you're
listening to the alex jones show it was actually probably the happiest in europe my life that
the year of german occupation for me it was a very positive experience it's a strange
thing because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are you're in considerable
danger yourself but you're fourteen years old and you don't believe that it can actually
touch you you have a belief in yourself your belief in your father it's a very happy making
exhilarating experience while hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped
off to the death camps george soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds
confiscating property from the jews these are pictures from nineteen forty four of what
happened to george soros his friends in neighbors europe hungarian jew who escaped the holocaust
by posing as a christian and you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps
right i was fourteen years old and i would say that that's when my character was made
in what way that one should think ahead one should understand and and anticipate events
and one one is threatened it was a tremendous threat of evil i mean it was a very personal
experience of evil my understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours
who swore that you were his adopted godson yes yes went out in fact and helped in the
confiscation of property from the jews that's right yes i mean that's that sounds like an
experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many many years
was it difficult not not at all not at all maybe as a child you don't you don't see
the connection but it was it created no no problem at all no feeling of guilt no for
example that i'm jewish and here i am watching these people go i could just as easily be
there i should be there none of that well of course i could i could be on the other
side or i could be the one from whom it the thing is being taken away but there was no
sense that i shouldn't be there because that was well actually funny way it's just like
in markets that if i weren't there of course i wasn't doing it but somebody else would
would be taking it away anyhow it was the whether i was there or not i was only a spectator
the property was being taken away so i had no role in taking away the property so i had
no sense of guilt are you religious no you believe in god no you may have heard that
starbucks is closing up shop today to implement mandatory implicit bias training the move
will cost an estimated 12 million dollars in lost revenue and critics say that amounts
to no more than virtue signaling what's worse experts claim that when you mandate this type
of training it actually does more harm than good so why would starbucks go through with
such a controversial move when it's costly and ineffective meet the perception institute
a think tank with the goal of propping up intersectionality which is at the cornerstone
of the liberal thought plantation here's the kicker the perception institute is supported
by you guessed it the george soros open society foundation as well as another globalist foundation
the ford foundation now that we're able to follow the money we can see exactly how the
story turns the perception institute is partnered with starbucks to set the precedent for other
companies to mandate this type of training and make it a cultural norm if this is something
you're opposed to try supporting a local coffee shop where you can check out more reports like
these at info wars dot com madwebber reporting and that's how it all ties together ladies
and gentlemen if you look at who's on the board of starbucks she's also some of the
ladies on the board with oprah wimpery's big global depopulation group oprah wimpery
of course has been in mainstream news meeting secretly with the global eugenics board with
david rockefeller and ted turner bill gates and others and she is for global depopulation
and so what was roseanne's big crime well it was tweeting that george soros was a nazi
collaborator something george soros responded to himself was false and the media dutifully
yesterday said that he's actually a holocaust survivor well i guess he did survive the holocaust
by being a collaborator and helping actively with his uncle roundup jews we just played
him earlier saying it but saying he felt no guilt because it's like markets he just filled
that slot speaking of eugenics it was thomas watson who received the highest award ever
given during the reign of the nazis from 1933 to 1945 he won the highest award ever given
to anyone in the rike for international business machines running the hollerith machines in
the slave camps and in the death camps of the tattoos were numbers to track you to put
into that how long you worked how much you'd be fed would you be right away killed or gotten
rid of or how long you'd be worked to death that's an absolute fact and ibm now has a
computer named thomas that is their main ai system that is running most of the hospitals
in europe and the u.s. on their bioethics boards deciding who lives and who dies that's right
so that's the new ai deciding who lives and who dies truth is trained in fiction that's
your right to death is actually the government's right to kill you i'm all for somebody's right
if they don't want to seek treatment or you know i don't want to go through pain anymore
but this is the state coming in saying no we're going to decide who lives and who dies with
our bioethics boards programming the computers so no one has any guilt when they kill people
well president trump just finished minutes ago live as this is a near time signing the
right not to write to live the right to try all these thousands of drugs and things that
are known to help people who are terminal live longer maybe even save them those are
being held up by the drug companies and by government trump just as he promised to innovate
the state of the union he just innovated massively let's go to that she said that this puts the
access in the hands of all the americans who are terminally ill some groups like the american
cancer society have pushed against this come on some democrats have pushed against it saying
that it puts those patients who again are terminally ill at risk the FDA may not have
vetted american cancer society runs the cancer is about to develop the cancer viruses in
the vaccine let's watch and listen together this is to me this is a very important moment
a very important day been looking forward to this for a long time along with senator
ron johnson and and i will tell you we worked hard on this i never understood why it was
hard they've been trying to have it passed for years i never understood why because
i'd see people friends of mine and other people i'd read about where they travel all over
the world looking for a cure and we have the best medical people in the world but we have
trials and we have long time 12 years 15 years even when things look really promising so
many years and i never understood why they didn't do this and we worked very hard and
pause please i want to thank we're gonna we're gonna come back with more of this on the other
side because this is a near time the speech is still ongoing it is a fact that they have
suppressed thousands of treatments i don't want to call them cures but in some cases it
cures people and all we get is 50 year old bug poison they call it chemotherapy and then
they suck everything out of you and the doctors aren't allowed to get the new treatments they're
blocking it all this is this is the eugenics control the Rockefeller control it keeps going
out the same people of our medicine and trump is breaking it all up it is amazing if you're
already gonna die you want to take some risky treatments that's how you should develop new
stuff let them do it but no instead the globalists take all the real stuff of themselves and very
expensive swiss clinics and other areas and then you don't get access to it well guess
what globalists you're not gonna hoard the life extensions to yourself watch my film
in game i know the president's seen it i've been told that's already what's going on so
he's not he learned it from in game he understands what's already happening and it's all about
them suppressing new medical developments it's all happening unlocking the secrets of the
universe everything trump promised we're gonna go to break them up with more please don't

action and i know you will
you're listening to the alex jones show
you're listening to the antidote for fake news it's alex jones everything about globalism
is suppressing american innovation american dominance but also ensuring that the general
public of the world doesn't get life extension technologies doesn't get clean air conditioning
clean cars they don't want innovation they want a post industrial world that's the official
goal of the u n u nesco agenda 21 that's a fact member obama went to african said you
can't have cars air conditioning he went to south america said you're gonna live in communism
i'm not and the people are like look at any of the graduate students so i feel so good
backing trump because you have a lot of terminally ill people in this country with thousands of
treatments that are known to extend their lives or even save them that sometimes they
wait 20 years and then never even approve something because they don't want americans
having access to this and yeah people are gonna die with some of these treatments but
they're already dying they have a right if the left says you have a right to kill yourself
and i think if you make the decision you do but you don't the state involved but the
larger issue is you have a right to take then whatever treatment you want you better believe
it but they want less treatments and man i was just watching him live i gotta air this
into the next hour because we backed up at the start he was saying americans have always
been fighters and we never give up this is very personal to me and he went on and talked
about that so he's the real deal folks and you know i'm being sued by the globalist
i'm being attacked the left admits they're lying about me they're trying to shut us down
but it's worth it for the children that we're gonna save through restricting abortion and
we're already cut it back through through what we're doing with the right to fight they should
have called the right to fight not just the right to try sounds like trump was to rename
it the right to fight and they have you know the new republic of the new york times all
this week saying alex jones is waking america up he must be silenced here's the new republic
the legal war on alex jones and they admit the democrats are financing opinion this is
the new york times the alex jones presidency oh they say in rolling stone it's not about
the first amendment and they totally misrepresent what i've done and what i've said and say
it's time that he platforming and get rid of the first amendment because nobody reads
you anymore because you're a joke the average rolling stone article has like zero comments
right about me it has thousands so i'm on the right side of history i'm so proud i backed
trump i'm so proud i've been proven right he's not perfect he's not a dictator he can't
do it all but he's the real deal and he is scaring these globals to death and so yeah
i got mad at trump when he bombed syria again because i know the rebels did the chemical
attack or staged it and this time they confirmed they didn't even do it it didn't happen and
trump withdrew the funding from the white helmets after but he was putting a rock in
a hard place and he didn't act they would have been able to launch a wider war so i
just more and more just trust trump in my spirit in my gut but also in his action they
don't want you have an access to technology we develop folks they got cures almost everything
now they can definitely extend your life and they don't know how to roll this out without
the public learning about it so that's what globalism is all about we're all fighting
about racism while we're all getting hit with chemical and biologicals and binary weapons
and trump knows all about it so i said the state of the union i'm gonna get that health
care and the cures and treatments they're blocking released it's your right if you want
to take it or not it's your right to read the insert you're already dying anyways and
he said and we're gonna we were learning the secrets of the universe i'm getting chills
right now he goes we're learning the secrets they already got a bunch of them he goes we're
gonna deploy those new technology new economies get massive chills right now every time god
knows i'm on the right track is get the chills it's like yes talk about this the innovation
the action we're gonna take what we're doing together standing together it's a bigger plan
like Kanye said doesn't mean there's not racism or stubs or weirdos on every front
but it means we the people that have love to stand up for what's right or coming together
and we see through the globalists trying to steal the future trying to steal everything
we got so i'm gonna go back to this powerful trump speech until we're done with it in the
middle of the next hour he's still going he's on fire and then we're gonna take your phone
calls today the toll-free number to talk about rosie and bars firing the right to try the
right to fight i'm telling you act china threatened to attack our ships if they come back in our
ships are still going in that's like the biggest ocean highway in the world they've just grabbed
the chinese were attempting a blockade basically the south China sea claiming they control the
navigation of it when it's always been an open seaway this is just this is incredible
now that's all coming up we'll hear from military folks on that front eight seven seven seven
eight nine alex eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven eight nine
two five three nine i'll go back to trump in a moment please don't forget we mutation
i got a lot of aces up my sleeve with the globalists with all their attacks and things
to fund expand the operation we already put so much product in our supplements with other
supplement companies mark stuff up on average seven times ours about 150 markup we do discounts
like a 50 markup where you know you're looking at a $70 bottle there's there's $30 a product
in that if it's something like dna force pqq coq 10 all it's very expensive ours is the
real organically source type by that i mean it's from organic sources it's lab created
you can't technically call it organic but it's from an organic source it's not synthetic
pick an example of that or or or our new tropic that other people sell similar formulas for
60 bucks ours is normally 3995 it's 1995 right now you cannot beat these deals and my ace
in the hole is i could water the products down and massively increase our capital to
expand the face of globalists but i'm not going to do that you want the best we have
gone out and develop the best it's why they're attacking our supplements trying to demonize
them trying to test them coming up empty time and time again until of course you know they
won't come up in because i we know what they're gonna do next when these people don't succeed
you know what they do scum of the earth so info wars life dot com info wars store dot
com or triple eight two five three three one three nine they want control the future we
just want freedom in the future so if you believe what we're doing and want great products
water filtration air filtration t-shirts books films go to info wars store dot com today and
fund our operation and we got free shipping it's a win-win across the board all right
let's i'm gonna try to shut up now and just get through in this segment the next few prompts
powerful on fire speech is about ten minutes ago he was wound up here it is was in there
and i say mike how we doing in that we got to get it approved and he was he was really
working it and it must say to the union address four months ago i called on congress to pass
right to try it's such a great name some bills that don't have a good name but this is such
a great name for the first day i heard it it's so perfect right to try and a lot of
that trying is going to be successful i really believe that i really believe it so we did
it and we went through the senate we went through the house the house had a bill the
senate had a bill we'd go and mission together we got to go back and take votes and i said
do me a favor tell me which is the better bill for the people not for the insurance company
not for the pharmaceutical companies i don't care about them i really don't i couldn't
care less they are so pissed right now folks they're blocking us for so long and that's
the bill i won't tell you which one but i took the one that was good they said one in particular
was great for the people not so good for the others great for the people we don't care
about the others right now and is giving terminally ill patients the right to try experimental
lifesaving treatments and some of these treatments are so promising and we're moving that timeline
way up anyway beyond this we're moving it way up but it's still a process that takes
years now it takes up to 15 years even 20 years some of these treatments are going but
for many years patients advocates and lawmakers have fought for this fundamental freedom and
as i said incredibly they couldn't get it and there were reasons a lot of it was business
a lot of it was pharmaceuticals a lot of it was insurance a lot of it was liability i
said so you take care of that stuff and that's what we did today i'm proud to keep another
promise to the american people as i sign the right to try legislation into law they want
to bully us that if we support the president we'll be destroyed so be it i'm not going
to turn my back on the president if i look like that i would have been president 10 years
earlier if i had that face if i had that head of hair i would have been president so long
ago that's great so i want to thank a couple of people secretary azar is here secretary
secretary please stand up you have worked so hard on this we're gonna go to break now
he really gets wound up here in a few minutes he's just thanking people right now we're
gonna start the the second hour here and you just see the progress it's like we had the
boat tied up at the dock he ever been trying to leave the dock in a boat and like oh whoa
we got a rope still on well he's just hacking the ropes off and there's only a few ropes
left and the globalists know that if he gets the economy fully back it's over for them
it's over they're not gonna probably get the house and senate it's the first time since
the civil war that didn't happen to a party out of power they are losers they are exposed
they're on the chai kong payroll and they're going to prison stay with us hour number two

listening to the alex jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex
jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info you know there are a lot of cowards
out there you want to hedge their backs and talk trash about trump talk trash about me
out the sides of their mouth play along with the mainstream media so they don't get blocked
and censored on the web if they're successful shutting us down they're going to shut all
of you down i'm not talking to our audience i'm talking to the establishment and one
of these out there the world is changing we're trailblazing and trump has kept another giant
promise he's kept already he's already gotten half of what he said he'd do done in a year
and a half unprecedented he's had about an eighty five percent accuracy rate on how he
implemented those things a dictator couldn't execute that well dictators can't write anything
everything falls apart i mean it's magic what trumps been able to do and yeah he's done
some things i haven't liked went back on his promise on afghanistan went a little bit sideways
on syria but overall he's been keeping his promise after that pulled the money out of
the white helmets that were caught staging the attacks the last ones that almost got
us into war that's four times they've been caught the first three they did the last one
they even do the attack that's confirmed boy they sure walk that one back suddenly you
don't hear about that anymore do you even the bbc had to admit they staged it pouring
water on kids heads oh but i'm not supposed to question other big events or i get sued
and they misrepresent what i've even said because they don't want you questioning they
want the precedent you've got to believe mainstream media that's what they're actually saying
in this article out of the new republic they say well jones isn't protected by new york
times versus sullivan because he's not really news only we in the newspapers are protected
you are unbelievable you are unbelievable as you spew a bunch of lies about me in your
article it's just these people are such liars there they're what they claim we are i trail
blazed i got censored my service got the news last december that they were paying millions
to have me delisted off google outside their algorithm having other companies go out and
put out lies about us and vote us down and they said because i exposed the chemical attacks
that year that april with ron paul and others but i mean the rebels admitted they launched
a chemical attack to get us in there they had the motive to but that okay fine people
like oh you're gonna get delisted you won't make as much money if you don't plan i'm not
playing along with al qaeda and isaac's launching chemical attacks to go blow up another country
protecting christians so i get more shares on the internet don't give a flip and flip
and it's not because i'm a hero i'm a real pragmatist i got into media to defend the
second amendment and the family and to expose abortion i got into it to expose the eugenicist
and the globalist i got into it to expose the whole global system and to have a better
system i got to end things to change things not to take over the existing system now we
got a beachhead with trump and that's why i know he's not perfect but he's getting a
lot done and that's why i'm now a cheerleader for that beachhead and he is starting to drain
the swamp and they are screaming they are yelling they are gnashing they are flipping
out they are bending over backwards they don't know what to do we come back and play the
rest of the speech and then go to your calls 8777892539 but they're trying to break our
will soros admittedly we broke this yesterday so on info wars.com get Daniels hit a blurb
we did a video got almost no attention let's retweet that because it broke in the afternoon
i want to retweet that out that breaking george soros is the main funder behind everybody
gets a chip on their shoulder everybody has a race war starbucks of course they are it's
the biggest franchise in the country and it's meant to create mental illness and even the
psychological studies we show in our article say it makes racism worse of course it does
what kills racism is inviting people over to your house to barbeque what invites racism
what invites it is all of this hyping up constantly and banning comedy and chips on the shoulders
it's crazy when we come back we're going to finish up with trump's powerful speech the
right to try the right to fight back the right to fight for your life act because if you're
already terminal and it's your decision if you got a right to kill yourself the left

Well ladies and gentlemen just four months ago at the state of the union Trump promised
to fight as hard as he could to get the right to try legislation through that they've tried
to get through for decades to allow people who are terminally ill to try experimental
treatments before they've been approved some are totally safe some are very very dangerous
many hundreds have already been approved in other countries but big US drug companies
that have the patents on deadly chemotherapy and other bug poison where they charge you
thousand dollars per treatment for something that cost them 30 cents they don't want competition
they want to cut and burn Americans they want to make sure they can kill you slow not the
doctors but the big pharma and the big control arms like Bayer that knowingly shipped out
HIV and hepatitis blood over a million hemophiliacs and Monsanto who's merging with them who's
even more evil well now Trump is keeping that promise again the right to fight again at
the left once everybody be able to commit suicide and have state sponsored systems killing
old people that's what right to die is it's the state's right to kill you well then don't
people have a right then to go out and take an experimental treatment if they're already
dying the governments around the world that are left is controlled are trying to make
it where if someone just doesn't want to live because they're depressed they can kill themselves
okay well then does someone have a right then if they're dying to fight for their life oh
no the left all over the US and all over the world they fight against this because they
want governmental control of health care and to decide what you get because their control
freaks Donald Trump is a progress freak Donald Trump's got a bigger plan Donald Trump's part
of the bigger plan Kanye's talking about we're all part of that bigger plan unlocking the
secrets of the universe so he just signed it a few minutes ago here's President Trump
the promised keeper four months ago we also believe that patients with terminal conditions
terminal illness should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially
save their lives people who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to
country to seek a cure I want to give them a chance right here at home it's time for
Congress to give these wonderful incredible Americans the right to try yes now it's long
and already the big pharma and the big insurance companies the ones that gave you obama care
the double and triple your prices thank god you're so dumb gruber said they're all Obama's
guys said you're dumb thank god you're so dumb I don't think you're dumb Trump doesn't
think you're dumb in fact I saw Trump in a speech last week I meant to give the clip
he said you know there are a lot of smart Americans you know I think Americans are smarter
than some people say they are you know I think if we treat them like they're smart we put
out information and have a real debate I think we'll turn the country around he totally gets
the enemy's attitude and more and more I watch Trump and it's magic man he's got it and
they wonder how he'll say the same thing I say the same day even simultaneously sometimes
or how I predicted the New York Times came to me on the inauguration day and they said
how did you predict he'd talk about bringing God back into America in the Covenant he'd
talk about unlocking secret technology and the New York Times guy right there as I was
leaving the inauguration he was waiting outside you know the VIP area and he said he said
how did you know that you talked to the president today did somebody give you the speech and
I said no we're synced up and that New York Times guy he wrote a big hit piece he's went
he took a deep breath he kind of shook because you get it because you're synced up with your
people screwing everybody over running your scams telling people how good you are when
you're not you're in a bunch of broken weak people and that's why you hate everybody
because scum like you wants to see everybody else suffer you rats you seek out their power
because you don't have any innate power in your soul well we're getting you off our
backs and you could feel it metaphysically and so I'm happy to be persecuted by you
people because no matter what happens to me in the end we are going to defeat you and
you know it all right let's let's go back to his speech to say for the next and I promise
I'm going to load a phone line here it is what do you think on health care have great
health care we got rid of the individual mandate without that we couldn't be doing what we're
doing in a few weeks that we we're going to have great inexpensive but really good health
care and we have two plans coming out we also have through our great secretary of labor
we have a great plan coming out and that's through associations and so we have two plans
coming out oh hit pause again for the most part do you have any idea what this is going
to health care costs they're going to plunge because they're blocking so many other alternative
treatments just calling them experimental never even letting me get to the process for over
a decade of being tested the big farm I wrote these laws do this okay nobody else puts up
with us and now this is going to be a whole new boom in the economy prices will go down
choices will go up and there'll be all these new treatment centers and all this new stuff

those things I want to thank secretary Azar and I want to thank commissioner Gottlieb
where's Scott Scott stand up I like this I like those stops and Scott let me ask you
so it takes years and years to get this approved right you're bringing down beyond this you're
bringing down that period of time what is the average time now it takes for you know a major
a major medicine or cure what's the average time it takes to go through the system and
get an approval three to seven and some go long over ten right and you're bringing that
down you're trying to bring that down you know for safety very good and you in particular
you're very happy with this aren't you you have a lot of good things in the wings that
frankly if you moved them up a lot of people would have a great shot right right that's
fantastic well thank you Scott we're very proud of you doing by the way you know why
Trump is obsessed with this too he knows what other rich people have access to he knows
what he has access to and he knows what they've gotten Thailand they've got in Switzerland
what they've got in other areas that is just unbelievable and he also knows that he's the
president and so over at the naval center and at the other places where he gets health
care and those special wings oh boy do they have some stuff he knows all about it so that's

you're listening to the alex jones show
from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones by the way we were gonna have a
tommy robinson update today but his guys got threatened they're talking to lawyers today they
think they'll be back on tomorrow so that's what's going on behind the scenes old tommy
has now been in prison since last friday and the judge bragged because we had the eyewitness
from the court tommy's manager on that this isn't about you and the covering the last grooming
thing you covered this trial the trial that judge is over i'm putting you in jail for 13 months
unbelievable but i'm going to your calls next segment i was just thinking during the breakout
the fda under democrat and globalist control has been trying to shut down people even getting
regular supplements how the e use been trying to lower the amount of vitamin c and stuff you
need how they took the iodine out of the salt and they put the bad halogen in the water fluoride
i mean it's just diabolical and then you read the documents how they're trying to make us dumb
and stupid and weak and and so just like they're blocking good medicines and good drugs from us
and good treatments that have around for decades
and then keeping prices up they're going after the supplements as well
don't keep them from that get the best supplements out there from our research
infowarstore.com some of the biggest sales ever 50 off of most of the items and free
shipping at infowarstore.com but those the sale isn't going to last past this week we've got to
stop it soon some of this stuff's getting ready to sell out like brain force plus we may have to
end that sale in a couple days because we're selling so much of it right now people love it
they know what a good deal it is all right let's go back to the president uh getting into signing
the right to try hey if the left says you are allowed to kill yourself even if you're not sick
why are they so against the right to try new medicines man just like the national health
service i watch preventative questions on c span and they always ask questions about
people waiting a year two three years for cancer surgery that's a hundred percent operable
but when you don't get it you die death sentences death sentences tell little girls we're not going
to fix your leg use a cane or we'll cut your leg off that's who the left is they're not the left
they're evil all the studies show it they're bad people they're all rich pigs like bernie sanders
praying on idiots let's go back to trump here it is drugs right and mr secretary that's already
happening right it's already happening you would tell me yesterday that we're seeing a big a tremendous
improvement and you're going to have some big news i think we're going to have some big some of the

the promise of america is truly coming back the idea that we built upon that made it the greatest
nation on earth that people from across the planet around the globe aspired to come to and be part of
and now president trump four months after promising to get the right to try
act through congress has signed it showed that big pharma who's been lobbying against it cannot
continue to block promising treatments to people that are terminally ill this will accelerate
many incredible treatments for everybody else this is true innovation the left of course has said
let everybody have the right to commit suicide let the state decide if they can get rid of you
if you're not needed like the netherlands on national tv has a down syndrome man on and explains
how he needs to commit suicide this is the sickness of these people but oh the liberals oh the the
mother jones is in the cnn's oh people might get hurt in these treatments it's their free will isn't
it that's what it's all about isn't it so trump here's the powerful video says america has always
been about fighters before he signs the historic legislation that's just happened minutes ago
and they're going to write to your phone calls here it is ladies and gentlemen america has always
been a nation of fighters who never give up here it is to receive a treatment
now with the passage of this bill americans will be able to seek cures right here at home
close to their family and their loved ones we are finally giving these wonderful americans
the right to try so important america has always been a nation of fighters who never give up right
we never give up ever right never give up we're fighters like the amazing patients and families
here today now as i proudly signed and this is very personal for me but as i proudly sign
this bill thousands of terminally ill americans will finally have the help the hope
and the fighting chance and i think it's going to be better than chance that they will be cured
that they will be helped that they'll be able to be with their families for a long time or
maybe just for a longer time that's right but we're able to give them the absolute best
as to what we have at this current moment at this current second and now we're going to help a lot
of people and that will raise a lot of people so it's an honor to be signing this and if if i might
i think i'll present i think i have to do this run i have to present this good-looking guy with
the first pen is that okay you don't mind right okay good i'm gonna do that all trump does all
day his classes test boy the left takes this they're just all vicious greedy hateful people
remember all the clips we could play of bill gates kid i'm telling teachers unions
if we don't give an old lady treatment that's 10 teachers we can hire and they're all rubbing their
hands together to the united states who has laid out when you build up higher quality economies
that everybody does better that's called civilization when you demand higher standards but in the new
globalist system we're supposed to live under austerity this is so critical this is so historic
what's happened okay we're going to your phone calls you have another amazing guest joining us
but i'm gonna get to all your calls here ali alexander getting into rosa and the war on free
speech that that amazing individual he's coming up let's go to your phone calls right now thank
you for holding chris in virginia you're welcome to join us thank you i just wanted to talk about
why it was important for trump to wait the year two and year one he wasn't gonna be able to get
anything done because he didn't have the power of the government now i say he's still at about 40
percent but it gives him the opportunity to actually put pressure on big farm because that's where
it a lot of the swamp is your thought i think didn't you call in about a year ago and you said
just give trump a chance watch what he does year two oh yeah oh yeah yeah that was me well i think
what you said is what we should listen to because you were right he's i mean it's just what you said
as he gets more power under the constitution as he finally gets through you see exponentially it
gets better it gives me chills yeah i definitely think that we're on the right path and we're on
the right track you just kind of get if people are impatient you know they're all very impatient with
trump you know the drain in the swamp takes time it's a lot 50 some years or more and i'm just saying
that as throwing it out there 50 plus years of corruption you try going up against a whole system
that's corrupt like that it would it will probably be depression and draining so i you have to
mark i was about to say just what they've done to me the media tried to come take my kids uh they've
got george soros hillary all of them suing me uh and i'm not complaining but let me tell you i
couldn't imagine being trump what they do to him and his family exactly i mean this is a war this is
real let me tell you i've never felt one one hundred the heat i've gotten support and trump
from the sides of evil that lets you know that these for real and the second thing i just wanted
to say i just wanted to let you know that i think that a lot of people cannot understand
why alex jones gets the intel that he does i think it even uh makes some of the people that you have
on with you a little bit jealous of even though they're smart people but you have to stay dedicated
to trump because i think you're the key in the bringing a lot of outside people that normally
wouldn't dig trump or get down with trump bring them across the even just pay attention a little
bit to what he's doing well the enemy has figured that out i didn't think i was that important but
they are legitimately saying bring down jones we'll have trump and i think it's only because
like you said we put out the counter talking points that are true that counter veiled their lies
and then and then other people pick up in talk radio and the internet what we're saying and so
they kind of see us as the epicenter not just me but the whole info wars operation so it that's
why i'm telling listeners what you're saying is absolutely true your hopes your prayers your
support is is critical uh because let me tell you they are coming after us and whatever happens i'm
i'm okay with it but i tell you i i really don't want them to win because i know we're going to
win in the end it's just that i may not do too well at the end of the equation and that's what
i asked for you know i prayed for god to put me in a position to take these people on but i thought
it'd be in some small junior bush league way i didn't ever envision it would be at this level
think of it this way you're doing a great service to your grandkids down the road
absolutely god bless you appreciate you man yeah it's uh i told people i'm not whining it's just
let me tell you i used i knew the globals were evil but let me tell you i really know now
and and when i say they're out to get you i mean they're just bad people folks they're really evil
people thank you chris god bless you who's been holding the next longest here uh let's go ahead
and talk to michael in louisiana go ahead michael you're on the air thanks for holding
thank you mr alex jones uh i want to send you a bit of appreciation for your generosity and
if you'd accept it i've made a design uh for a t-shirt it's a we are all tony robinson now t
design it's very simple black and white but very very elegant it's funny you say that i thought
about that this week because that's you know pretty much a common sense deal we should have
shirts that we're all trump now we're all tony robinson now we're all alex jones now because
the people really want to put themselves out there to meet good people but also be persecuted
to see what it's like i think those are three great shirts that we should immediately have produced

you're listening to the alex jones show
you thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever but you rode upon a steamer
to the violence of the sun broadcasting live from the un stronghold austin texas
you're listening to the alex jones show we're going right back to your phone calls but matt
drudge has made another really really good point i remember seeing this this morning and even
split second thinking man i ought to read the side effects of ambian but sure enough drudge
did it the company mocked rozan saying how dare you say in the middle of the night you were kind
of out of it so your filter was gone and so now she says oh you can't forgive me oh i'm so horrible
what cuz you called a lady that looked like a fish said she looked like a monkey i mean it's
just everybody called trump monkeys and apes and everything else it's ridiculous it's absolutely
ridiculous but she's all groveling to him but drudge it's an article on info wars dot com
drudge highlights ambian side effects after company mocks rozan sleep aid claims not responsible
for sitcom stars racism i remember a few years ago an asian man with no criminal record for no
reason was walking around in a trance shooting at people and shot a cop in walmart in austin
and i remember saying on air i bet he was on something like ambian because i've known people
that i've worked with let's just say that that are really nice who woke up in the middle of the night
on ambian and we're just walking down the street naked i mean you just totally can black out on it
and and and that's what the insert says so she blames it on that she blames it on multiple
personalities whatever the psychotropic drugs and they make a joke so what does drudge do we've got
a link to it on info wars dot com he tweeted it but we have a list of them vomiting diarrhea
impaired vision slow breathing memory loss disorientation depression suicidal thoughts
anxiety insomnia nightmares confusion dizziness aggression addiction withdrawal which can be
life threatening it just goes on and on and on oh but the company that makes it says people of all
races religions and nationalities work on it every day and improve the lives of people around the
world so there's no rozan ha you're crazy so yeah the very big pharma that doesn't want all these
other better treatments coming out that doesn't want you to have choices they're the ones that
want to tell you that ambience really great or wonderful i've never taken ambian i don't like
pills i barely even take you know ad-vill well i've got a spring ankle or whatever but i can
tell you right now that i've talked to people who are well-meaning people in society how they say
oh yeah no i've blacked out on ambian or i first got my ambian prescription drank one beer and
didn't know who i was for six hours it's hard core stuff so there you go ladies and gentlemen
that's up on info wars dot com an important article if you know somebody on ambian get that out to
them especially okay uncle sam and louisiana you were uh going to say 5g rozan a smokescreen ie drudge
i go ahead oh yeah you were right on you i think this is all a beard of course the whole racism
thing because yesterday who's speaking of matt roge the headline up that i saw was her talking
about the 5g that was the main headline so it was that because that fits in with the eugenics program
that's right you can't have her talking about about soros you can't have her talking about
saying he's an osc laboratory when he admittedly was in his own words you can't have any of that
you can't ever talk about 5g when she's the number one tv star that's it that's why so it's a beard
it's just it's a shiny keys here the shiny keys folks will come here get you all fighting talking
about the definition of comedy and racism and what is you know what is humor and why do you think
george soros is the main funder in their own press release of the starbucks you're going there to get
coffee not to hear about how you're racist exactly now we know what this is the people on the street
and what it is i'm talking every day i wish i would have had that oh last week i spoke this this
video is the congresswoman's daughter she's a congresswoman from uh colorado her husband
is the chief the head chief of fort bragg medical facility now finally you know then of course i go
home the next day and you're talking about what's in the in the veterans if i'd known that the day
before it's still a good video i still have to put up a video i talked two days ago to a uh interrogator
a senior interrogator in a for terrorists in afghanistan at the largest facility they have
over there and he told me about how many more terrorists that are in there now since trump
has got in what's going on there so the reaction of the people on the street no they know i mean
twice people from talking to from around the world especially and there's hours of everybody on
your youtube channel a lot of times you live stream you give people your youtube channels
address uncle sam yeah it's it's my name michael d barry di capital b a r i but the easiest way to
get there now is the latest video i put up is americans talk tommy oh yeah just real bravely
i said you're you're great but i don't get other callers uh what did uh what's their view on tommy
robinson being disappeared for reporting on giant pedophile uh trials well but oddly enough two
scottish people that ran into were very negative on tommy and but the other people the other people
of course were appalled by the censorship that was going on yeah you know it's funny the scott's
fought the hardest against tyranny historically in europe and now i've seen the statistics they are
the biggest socialists the biggest anti-free speech people on average a lot of great scott's
that's very shameful what's been done to the scott's shocked by the reaction of these two
different scottish guys i spoke to i mean they sounded like the biggest social justice warriors
like i so they thought it was a great idea to throw people in jail that report on giant muslim
kidnapping rings oh i hammered them i said how do you even justify what you're talking about
i mean that they know because you drive a lot of kinship with with what tommy robinson i'm on the
street too i'm i'm right there on the front line it's but you know tommy's got bigger balls
that i do he's he's you know he was into the bad neighborhoods i'm out there in the middle of a
tourist area so you know it's a bit different well you're a big guy too but i don't mean you
haven't had leftist threaten you uh so we might have to actually play that later we have time
put that video back on screen for me thanks guys um it's tommy robinson versus the scottish is
that it uh well the one yeah tommy robinson versus the scottish that's one the other one below that
is um we're all tommy robinson now that was the first one i posted a few a couple of days ago
but listen we were synced up i think i meant to put a t-shirt out like that and then i was
intended to give some of the proceeds to tommy so i'll say it now we're gonna print that shirt
only take a week we'll get the ad up today we never do stuff back order but we'll say
back order to expect it you know two weeks or so we're gonna print it now we'll get we're all
tommy robinson now and and i've got to do it for me too because they're all attacking me now
we're all alex jones now and we're all donald trump now but that's like i am spartagus when they came
to the rebel leader who just overthrown most of the romans they finally defeated him
they said we want spartagus we want to torture him to death he was already crucified under another
name on the road to rome and they also said i'm spartagus i'm spartagus so that's the attitude
you're not going to intimidate us you're not going to bully us but yeah send us your design and we
might print that one up too but that's a great idea i'm getting on it right now you're a genius
god bless you uncle sam he's got such a great youtube channel every time i come across it okay
so i go to all your calls here i'm trying to be a good boy uh let's go to and hold the longest here
kevin and then john uh let's go to kevin in florida you're on the air then john
thank you so much alex i just want to make two quick points uh the first being the the total
hypocrisy of the brain dead ignorant left with this ridiculous rosa and bar tweet um where was the
left at when joy bayer openly praised that trump tower was on fire and that she hoped the president
was in there burning with the other people what where were they on that people need to wake up to
these these tactics they've done cartoons as me as the gorilla i think it's funny they've done
trump as an orangutan and they did bush over and over again is it chimpanzee because he kind of
looked like one well that's all fine and good because that was from the liberal perspective so
you know do do not to unto us as i say so i just people just need to wake up to what's going on
because sooner or later we're gonna wake up one day uh and we're gonna be in a worse trance
and we're gonna be like britain where if you criticize anybody they're gonna throw you in jail
this is a process they've they've already got it in most of europe they've got it in england
they're cut they said they want to set the precedent of lying about me in the news
shutting down my speech to shut everybody else's down since you mentioned this it's a great point
go ahead and stay there here again here's bill mar calling uh you know trump the product of an
orangutan here it is and finally new rule now that he's suing me for five million dollars because
he says he's proved that he is not the love child of an orangutan
Donald trump must learn two things what a joke is and what a contract is uh i agree and the left
should figure that out too last point kevin uh and then the other point was uh just have you seen
this new uh active shooter game i believe the daily mail has it where i did see it it's a
perfect trainer for mental patients to go and shoot schools up it's just incredible because
some of the comments on here are saying that some of the hallways resemble columbine parkland and uh
and uh the the place in stanifate texas so just it's it's totally incredible what's going on here
man it really is a living twilight zone absolutely 100 of the mass shooters is obsessed with shoot
them up video games fact not saying ban them fact guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial

you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report it's alex jones
all right we got a very popular political commentator who's really smart alie alexander
of american priority dot com uh joining us coming up talk rozan bar to take more your
calls on that subject the crackdowns on free speech it's all coming up right now thanks for
holding i appreciate you calling in i'm very thankful uh john in pencilvania you're on the
air worldwide go ahead hello alex jones i am actually thrilled in fact i've got goosebumps
talking to you i've just got my info wars hat thank you for the bumper stickers they were being
well received up here in upstate pa thank you sir thank you sir uh what i'd like to point out
and tell you especially you know my mouth to your ear is that especially now we've got the
tommy robinson thing going on now i know in england they have the magna carta here we have the
constitution that was supposedly muddled after that but we have our bill of rights because we
are a republic everybody i hear even on info wars says says democracy we are not a total
democracy or a representative republic yes we are a republic but nobody ever points that
out no i need to do it more i think i should cut a promo where i explain that democracy pure
democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner the first democracies in in in greece
they would have you know one bucket of white rocks one bucket of black rocks whoever got the most
you know yay or nay they would vote routinely to kill somebody who they didn't like what they said
so in a pure democracy 51 could vote to kill the other 49 percent people knew what it was they would
never say i want to live in a democracy but we may need to have it pointed out that we are a republic
so that we can defend ourselves someday and not end that's right we have a bill of rights we we
have a republican form of government a federalist system it's a limited democracy and it's set up
with game rules to protect the minorities as well as the majority we have the best form of government
the world we've had a lot of problems a lot of corruption but the ideals in our system are the
best that's why it's under attack by these multinational corporations that pay no tax
are totally lawless and are tax exempt and have diplomatic immunity they are the enemy of this
system they want to destroy it you are the only one with the audience big enough to actually start
to wake people up sir i used to hammer the hell out of the democracy versus republic deal and i
just when you done it 10 000 times you sound preachy but you're right we we are a republic not a
democracy there is a big difference and you're absolutely on target could you possibly someday
actually entertain the idea of of being back on the shortwave it might be in yours and everybody
else back on back on the shortwave yeah instead of i mean if you get cut off of youtube last time
i checked i'm still on paying to be on shortwave we're not on there we're not on there uh i used
to listen to you i think on w w c r but now that i got you on youtube it's a lot better i can see
your smiling face oh god i feel sorry for what you're nice thank you god bless you sometimes
i get sick of myself but thank you so much john i believe we're on w w c r because that's one of
the things i just pay each month to be on there six hours a day because i get letters from missionaries
and people in africa and folks listening and a lot of folks in middle of nowhere listen we better be on
there um you guys go call w w c r just call the number off their deal and ask when we're on or
check with accounting and make sure i'm paying for that we pay for a lot of satellites a lot of other
stuff there's been some mom and pop stations that we've been on you know 15 16 17 years and i
sent a little check to each month we may actually have to stop doing that though these lawsuits
and you know their plans to shut us down you know go further but hopefully that's not the case but
yeah i'm i'm putting all the coal in the in the engine here to get the water boiling to get the
pistons going or to get the wheels turning so that we can go full attack speed and the and the
satellites we're getting a lot of new tv stations a lot of new radio stations uh a lot of new cable
systems but those are new listeners getting used to us so they're they're not really buying a lot
of stuff but we're reaching people we're getting contacts from them that's what matters it's our
original hardcore audience that despite all the attacks like a lighthouse and they're out on that
promontory that makes it all possible so without you we would not be here so i want to thank you all

thank you so much for joining us alley alexander is a political consultant philosopher and activist
an organizer of american priority dot com he has been consulting for republican campaigns
and conservative issues for 11 years the national level but now he is much more interested in
philosophy and building a better society and it's a patreon dot com four slash alley alexander
twitter at alley well that's a coveted at twitter an organizer at american priority dot com i love
that name i love the clips and things i've seen of him over the years and i'm just glad we've
got him here with us today to talk about where he sees us as a philosopher and as a political
consultant at this moment in time if the enemy wrote the history books or if we wrote the history
books in the future what you would call this period i i think it's the second great awakening
uh the the the true launch of the renaissance uh that what we've seen the last 500 years all
the problems but also the good things was the detonator and so now we're going to see exploding
towards that singularity and if we just make it through the next 30 40 years i think we're
going to look back on this time uh as the as right before the new golden age i agree with
scott adams and others and a lot of people in the establishment realize that they cover control but
maybe i'm wrong and then we'll look at rosanne bar and oh i was on ambien or i was i got multiple
personalities why is she backing off from a joke they've they've caricatured me as an eight
trump as a as an orangutan george w as a as a chimpanzee because i mean let's face it trumps
hair when it was orange looks like orangutan colored i mean i've i've actually told i mean i've
had girlfriends before like their hair bleach when it's black or brown i'm like that looks horrible
your hair looks like an orangutan i mean brunette should not bleach their hair it looks like an
orangutan uh now trump i guess it's just bad coloring but i mean i don't care i kind of
like his orange hair it's kind of it's a funny trademark but uh so we're going to cover the
field here uh thank you so much for joining us today sir it's it's good to have you on board
with us well thanks alex it's nice to uh finally connect well you heard me lay out the buffet and
you've got a million points i know you can cover what do you want to tackle first where we are in
history or the whole rosanne thing let's talk about rosanne because she's under fire in fact
just in the past half hour one of our mutual uh opponents ben Shapiro is giving rosanne hell he's
talking crap about me on his podcast right now live he's talking crap about you and what we really
need to protect is free speech free thought free expression and free association so that's why i'm
here on info wars because we got to start talking we cannot let the oligarchs and the people that
you know ben Shapiro is associated with control our thoughts or what we do or who we associate with
yeah i love it how the left is always policing who you can talk to who you can uh associate with
always misrepresenting who they're demonizing they want to be the policemen uh of discussion the
thought police and it's just some heroes always popping up saying alex jones is bad don't go on
his show uh rosanne's not a conservative well i mean i tend to agree but he's saying you know
she's a bad person all this crap or what she said was racist when it clearly wasn't and so that's
my issue is that he's propped up by some texas billionaires fine but the guy is not self made he
couldn't build anything and i'm just tired of him now becoming the new glenn beck trying to be in our
business yeah look i dropped out of college twice you know i went to college i went to bible college
in dallas dropped out went to a university of north texas and didn't drop out started my business
in 2006 2007 hit it big when digital uh was coming to a republican campaign so i've been
really fortunate and blessed to be good at what i've done and i've largely been behind the scenes
i've worked for hacks like john mccain i made christine o donnell the household whole name
the tea party challenged the republican party in new york 23 if you remember i am back and
in uh new york 23 uh you know that was really the birth of the tea party movement so i've
heard successful intellectual in the launch of the new renaissance yeah and i i'm a black
i'm a biracial black arab and the republican party but ben Shapiro has been you know kind of
cultivated since he was 14 he has all these major foundations paying him 10 000 20 000
dollars to speak at these colleges while he's trying to deport platform people like you
were milo unopolis it's absolutely batshit crazy and i'm not going to tolerate it anymore it's time
for people to start pushing against the thought police on the left and the right and embracing
free thinkers like kanye and rosanne who might be on the left or you and i who might be on the right
exactly he's there to gatekeep that's why the leftist groups fund him to keep conservatives and liberals
exactly the loyal opposition to keep liberals and conservatives apart and to make sure that
libertarian renaissance ideas of taking humanity forward don't come together he's a total gatekeeper
calling for us to be censored while he's financed by the universities he is a shameful person and
the reason we raise him is he's just such a created artificial commodity who thinks he's our god but
when you go to his own website that has some great articles most of the comments hate his guts so
what does that tell you it tells me that he's out of touch you know he might make a fine publisher
and he's got encyclopedic knowledge about politics and current events but have you ever heard i mean
you know alice you've been in this longer than i have i've been in it for 11 years but have we
ever heard an original thought from ben Shapiro i've heard original thoughts from mike sternovich
no he i mean for me he is the king of plagiarism well you know i you know that that may be true too
and an intellectual plagiarist that's all i'm saying because so many things i've heard him say
i know are from other famous philosophers and others which is fine but you just be clear that
when i quote cicero i tell people it's cicero or i quote nishi i tell people it's nishi yeah and
that's and that's and that's very very true and i think that what you're doing is you're hitting
the nail on the head he's misguiding some of these youth you know these college youth that you know
worship him and worship milo and can't understand where the beef is they're like hey you guys all
need to get along well we can't get along when ben Shapiro is trying to de platform us and
steal everyone else's ideas in what other era that's right i mean i've talked to i mean just off
record he wasn't off record discussion but i've had off record discussions as well with other people
but like Shapiro's in everybody's business he's the one that basically ran yinopoulos out of
right bart he was always trying to get rid of him he didn't want more good people at right bart to win
he wanted to be in total control makes me sick he's got that narcissist psycho looking his eye yeah
well i'm gonna after after this appearance what i'm gonna do is i'm actually gonna send him an
email i'm gonna offer him a piece if he doesn't want peace we're going to war i can talk about
how he and his friends have stopped the friends of abe from meeting i can talk about how he skipped
out on uh andrew brightbart who is a mutual friend of ours obviously uh uh i can talk about how he
skipped out on one of andrew brightbart's memorials uh in washington dc a party that i threw where
everyone else was there steve was there larry was there the entire bright bart team was there but
ben Shapiro couldn't uh couldn't make it on time and then wanted to break fire code when he came up
so we can start a war with ben Shapiro if he really really wants one but what i want is i want more
voices not less that's what he wants less voices and he wants to say who can talk to who so the
reason we brought him up because he's not that important is uh i i guess he's attacking you
coming on the day he thinks he's god he's attacking me for defending roseanne bar and it just so
happens that it comes at a time when i'm about to appear on your show to talk about roseanne bar
and i'm happy to defend uh people who aren't racist roseanne is not a racist if she was a racist i
would call her out i can't believe she's i agree she's falling on her sword like this for making
jokes i mean come on yeah and alex i mean just like all right me you and the audience leveling
out i didn't think i was going to tell anyone this but i got on my periscope 15 000 people
tuned in and i had a confession i said look i've actually looked at valerie jarrett before because
she has sunken eyes a protruded mouth this isn't necessarily a black feature ben stiller who's a
jewish comedian uh has the same features and big ears there's same there's all kinds of people who
look like different characters snoop dog looks like a dog but i've looked at valerie jarrett and i
said wow she looks like arie from the reboot of planet of the apes in 2001 and i never wanted to
tell anyone that because i am aware of the uh the racial sensitivity and i don't want anyone to go
around calling black people monkeys but let's be clear roseanne bar did not call did not say that
black people look like monkeys she didn't even say that valerie jarrett looks like a monkey she said
muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes equal the jay what she was saying is it's a hodgepodge
of beliefs and a look and it wasn't sensitive she didn't know valerie jarrett was um was uh 65
percent black uh i you know but but come on let's just be really really honest about this
she wasn't comparing valerie jarrett to a monkey because she thinks she's dumb valerie jarrett
is one of the most nefarious people in all of paul's let's talk about let's talk about valerie
jarrett we come back plus that that picture of roseanne barry to shut up she looks like uh ursula
from my little mermaid i'm not trying to be mean to her but she does kind of look like ursula you
know and grabs the wand and steals the voice and everything alie alexander's our guest he's on fire

if you're receiving this transmission you're part of the cutting edge worldwide revolution against
collectivism and the big corporations pushing it if you are receiving this transmission you
are the resistance live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones ali alexander is our
guest political consultant analyst talk show host you name it patreon.com forward slash ali alexander
twitter at ali it's an amazingly good twitter handle right there isn't it and the point is
is that he's been private until recently he's been behind the scenes political guru for the whole
kind of trump wave you're seeing but even before that he's worked for republic establishment and
now he more and more is going public to a great fanfare and to a lot of support kind of blasting
onto the scene even though he's been behind the scenes for a while why did you feel that this
last year or so is the time for you to do this because what the ultimate culture war is now
manifesting or why yeah we are it you know alex you hit you know your readers may not know how
well read you are how you you know spend time you know studying these topics when you're not on air
you and i have a number even though we've never met we have a number of mutual friends so i've
heard uh you know the rumors but we really are 40 or 50 years from determining whether we will live
as corporate slaves or whether we can be free and peaceful around the world and so what i thought
is that the maga movement needed somebody who knew what ben knew edmund burk russell kirk you know
traditional conservatism someone the maga movement needed somebody to guide them through okay well
what is the repeal process of obama care look like because there are people who were lying to the
president and i had to get on periscope and make sure that the white house comms department was
putting stuff on the president's desk and so um you know i'm willing to burn down my career
because if we all pledge to each other our lives our fortunes our our honor then i think we can
save this country and the world because of the globalists know they have us they win for those
that don't know obama care written to screw everybody over trumps destroying that this new
thing he did this this right to fight for your life this uh this right to try think about how
the left's fighting that when they're saying have the right to commit suicide well i'm a libertarian
i say okay you don't have the state involved that's where i say i'll fight the death against it
that's what bill gates pushes but now they're all pissed about the right to try what is wrong
with these people big pharma big pharma it's the same thing that's wrong with um you know when the
riddling comments were made the other day it's the same thing uh that's wrong why uh the ambient
the parent company of ambient attacked rosa and bar today they want us i mean i i i wish this was a
conspiracy i'm not a conspiracist there's a lot of it's an open conspiracy it's an open conspiracy
that cnn would not survive without big pharma period and so what they don't want is i'll tell you
out i actually made a lot of money when trump got elected why because the next day i got up and i
bought an etf called labu now this is not investment advice i'm not talking about the timing now but
the day after the election i bought a ton of labu it's an etf that puts together a lot of biotech
stocks why because i was listening to the president and he said i'm going to war with the fda because
we're going to reduce drug prices but i'm not going to let you be dependent on it what trump is
doing is absolutely genius he wants there to be more available cheaper drugs but he doesn't want
anyone dependent on them we have not seen a president who is this empathetic and this knowledgeable
about how policy affects people as societies and communities uh maybe ever i was about to say he is
he is so incredibly empathetic yeah and and then when you really study the policy it what he ends up
doing is so good so what do you get congress to do it'd be even better and like he said today
i said i don't care what bill you get through i want the bill that's the best for the people
and i want real experts on that that aren't from big pharma and i want wide spectrum analysis
and he said i don't care what they think that's why they're so angry yeah yeah because you and i
know you're a libertarian i'm a conservative you and i know that the corporations actually want to
limit the competition because then they have a monopoly and um so the right to try breaks open
those doors look i'm surprised trumps has done this good i'm not just a sycophant just groveling
i was freaked out when my gut told me to endorse him but i've gone with it and now it's been right
i can't believe though he's gotten this much done and i really worry what is the system gonna do
because they're getting you know we see videos now a fox news host are having uh coffee and tea
thrown on them at restaurants not just me this hate by the crazed cult of the left that aren't
even leftist that are just just just just just just trash news junkies they are so crazed up and so
existentially threatened by us just trying to give them renaissance that i wonder what they're
gonna do next it's it's gonna get really really bad i you know before the steve's khali stuff i
said that it would be a year before um the left engaged in radicalized violence and i was wrong
it happened about three months after i gave a predictive analysis that any society that has
engaged in this this is where the people charged with disseminating information hide information
about violence from the public it allows no chilling effect so if you study sociology
you knew this stuff was coming and so when the steve's khali shoot shooting was coming well of
course it had to happen there were organized mexican gangs uh antifa and democrat activists
in san jose in 2016 who beat the living crap out of trump supporters and that's when i decided okay
i gotta support this guy because i've i've sat with trump we've talked in 2014 they told me
that he was going to run i didn't believe sam numberg when he told me they offered to hire me
in 2011 i had spent money uh with a super PAC against trump so i've i've spent my life because
you're really a real progressive i would guess that they meant progressing humanity not what
they're doing trying to take control if they start this race war this won't be good for any common
people no it won't it won't it will lead in utter bloodshed and then the corporations will promise
us to bring us peace you know by total political correctness and school level brainwashing you
can see them priming it george soros is openly the main funder of the starbucks brainwashing
i mean you can see their plan it's not a joke it's not an exaggeration i am not anyone who's
ever peddled any conspiracy or anything like that any one-off theory i've tried to see the
wiki leaks that they want culture war they want a culture war they want a culture war that's
that's how they're gonna make their money it's very intriguing we're going to break and come back
into a bunch of the subjects but yeah get into the fact if you were a big guru of the republican
still are work for mccain work for others and and how you were told trump was running is what you
just said i learned you know once he was already running from folks that he'd been drafted by the
military that was already thinking about a coup against the globalists because they were another
multinational coup but they decided no let's draft somebody get behind them reboot america we can do
it and then this has all happened so now the fb is gone from claiming we're russians to now behind
the scenes they think roger shun and i were not even involved in any of this higher level pentagon
people are now trying to claim we're the mastermind of an american coup against the democrats so at
least now at the rubber meets the road level 13 people have been questioned they're segwaying away
from russia to okay who's the american cabal well it's it's an open conspiracy of people that don't
want to be slaves right and that's and that's the truth and we're fighting back and we as americans
are promised in our constitution that we can take any stance on any policy and that's not tradition
that doesn't violate the logan act it's entirely crazy what a faction inside the doj and the deep
sater doing but thank god for trump because now we have more whistleblowers than ever and after the
break i want to get more into that because the people who are doing the hard work are the whistleblowers
at the doj and thank god trump is creating a spectacle in the public that's providing that is
so on target ali because they make it like we're against the fb of the doj no we're against the
clinton criminal cancer cabal less than one tenth of one percent running the whole show
and it's it is the fbi and it is the doj and it is the cia and it is the pentagon that is helping
the american people try to remove this because finally they understood that the country was
about to be completely ended by hillary she was going to sell us out to china it was over so what
were they going to do when they lost they freaked out and said we're not giving up we're going to
call trump or russian and flip the script on them we'll be back with ali alexander this is dan

jones show big brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he live
from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
alley alexander made the point about close to half of mainstream news is funding is big
pharma when i was famously on pierce morgan they admitted the top news event of that year top ratings
they i was banned everywhere else after that because i was getting people out of the paradigm i
was shaking them out of their trance they admitted that they were going to have me on for most of the
hour but as soon as i in the second segment talked about don't blame american gun owners for some of
the shootings that they're very rare but still you know out of control i said blame the mass
murder pills on the inserts the prozac class drugs it says it can cause you to commit suicide
megalomania mass murder you name it and boy they were cutting that segment off at that point so here's
a piece of that famous footage america's number one cause of unnatural death now is suicide alex not
not a real accident not cancer not you excuse me of attacking the second member of the constitution
i want to get people off pills that the insert says we need to commit suicide and kill people alex
let's get about the second i want to blow the real culprit alex suicide pills alex mass murder
pills okay let me ask you one question you'll believe in this i'm wrong first time anybody's
ever heard this by the way i didn't like that so ali alexander i wanted you to get into though
behind the scenes first being told trump would run 2014 2015 uh and what was going on behind the
scenes because that's critical for the history we're now witnessing and then we'll get into the
whistleblowers you were talking about now critical that is so in 2014 i was the deputy director of
an rnc sponsored conference uh it was a republican leadership conference and uh donald trump uh was
flying in uh you know he had some accommodations that he wanted and at this point alex i did not
like trump i like i said in 2011 i found a big funder to spend some money to try to keep him
out of the primary i didn't consider him conservative uh you know i i didn't like his social or moral
values and when i walked in that room i was hit with this burst of energy and the dude is one of
the most empathetic dudes you will ever meet he's an empath really everyone was so scared they were
they were standing and i thought well i'm gonna show this guy you know and i sat down on the
couch and then he said you know what you look like sammy davis jr and i'm sure you know you're
coming as well exactly and what people look like they look like that let he looks like a fish you
look like sammy davis jr i look like a pumpkin i mean you know and and and we're all god's children
you know we're all god's children rosa and bar believes that i mean rosa and bar is a jewish woman
who wants peace around the world you know she retweets stuff about palestinian children and she
wants to secure israel i mean and she stood up for tommy robinson yeah so that the people think
that she has this secret hate in her heart and she's been working in hollywood for decades is
absolutely hogwash but anyway so me and trump this is what i noticed alex is i'm used to writing
people's speeches trump had computer paper and a sharpie and was writing his own speech
a half hour before oh that's what's incredible with trump they go oh oh notice he wrote a
letter to a teacher they made fun of it because of grammatical errors and things yeah hey you
actually got a letter from him yeah people do not know this man is authentic and i'm not gonna
talk about what happened for the next half hour but i'll say that the dude's memory is very astute
he quoted uh four of the most recent state polls within louisiana because republicans
were divided uh there and he told the candidate to get out of the race and i thought well here's
a man who's empathetic writes his own speeches and cares about the republican party uh uh
getting a majority so anyway he gets on stage uh he gives a rousing speech he gets off stage
he says ali i want to walk where do i have to go now i said well i have to take you through
the kitchen to take you to your press conference and he said no i want to walk through the crowd
and i said well you're trump let's do it and we walked through the crowd and the next governor who
who uh our governor uh our old governor got on stage and don trump just walked off stage
so here's all these louisiana state troopers me and trump and the crowd just goes like this
and i realized the man is a strategist and strategist and so i took him to steve bannon
he did his hit then we went to uh the press conference we ran that he denounced racism
and donald sterling uh you know the uh nva owner so anyway they were telling me they said ali we're
really gonna run and i said sam you guys aren't running this is always a joke with y'all but i
realized that i needed to rethink how i saw this man when when donald trump did run i did not support
him in the primary but when it came to violence and when i saw that donald trump was willing to
sit down with christian leaders and conservative leaders like mike pence and uh james dobson
and now you see that he's marching at pro-life events that no republicans ever done i mean he's
the real deal he's the real deal by the way it's not it's not a trump grovelfest here he's changed
a lot too he's become a lot more christian he's he's told me that personally and he said no it's
true he said that was never really around all these real churches he was around these fake
churches didn't have any energy and he loves veterans he loves black churches he loves everybody
but that's what trump the talks i've had is what you talk about boom the energy and then he talks
about the energy and trump is all about good energy it's not meta it's not mumbo jumbo it's that the
left he picks up an energy of death the the energy of pro-life and patriots he picks up the energy
of life and that's what he gets he literally gets charged up by people but he's not vampiric he charges
you up yeah this is not new age uh book crap this is the study of psychology and when he was a child
he studied under a pastor who who uh was famous for talking about the power of positivity and so
in a lot of ways trump went decades of his life without authentic christians and people who wanted
to return to localities back self-governance and when he finally came to it like what you said
he's come our way where they've come his way i'm not sick of family no he said he said publicly
privately he said i've changed he goes i know god's real i he could feel that the energy of bible
believers is the strongest out there yeah it's it's absolutely true so it's it's obvious to me
that god has a mandate on this man's life and this is either going exactly and look how much he scares
true evil like soros and hillary and people they are so scared of him yeah think about it i mean he
can call these nasty ms-13 gangs animals and the media will defend them this isn't about partisan
politics this is about a social construct that is that now the right has an opportunity to meme with
the left and the left has had a total monopoly for the past 50 years and then kanya talks about a
bigger plan humanity the next level uh and love and trump talked about love today in his speech
i mean i think we're really breaking the satanic will of the globalist right now and even believe
in god folks their energy is take take take hate everybody just imagine the worst day you ever had
times a thousand and and they've just given in to just total destruction they've got to be removed
they they have to and what's what's brilliant about the time that we're living in alex and you're
part of this your viewers are part of this i mean people are going to look back in 10 years
and see that you are a pioneer in a field of new media i mean it's honestly going to be that we
are going to break the media no one trusts them anymore not the bernie sanders justice democrats
not the tea party conservatives and they think if they destroy me that destroys everyone leaving
them it does nothing it it does absolutely nothing people are waking up kanya is waking up i don't
believe in a holographic simulation uh theory but i do believe that there is a simulation of sorts
right we're told go to college settle a lot of debt get on some drugs that is the fake simulation
they get us to opt into their false paradigm yeah and it offers no freedom it offers no love it offers
no redemption or forgiveness and that was what really struck me about hillary clinton's comments
and that's when i chose i would go down with the ship i would go down with donald trump
even though my friends were saying this will destroy your career i said i don't give a damn
she said before she said that people were deplorable she said they were irredeemable i don't know a
single method is she claims to be saying she's a god she's saying she's god right right and she
has judged us unworthy and i said i said no siri i'll leave this country if she wins and i'm honest
honest to god i was going to go move to south america i told trump that i might leave if she
wants i'd have to she's coming he said you're not going to leave you're not going to leave he goes
he goes you're going to have a bigger family a bigger house and in the way he said it didn't
mean a bigger house like like america is a kingdom of liberty our house is getting bigger yeah yeah
it isn't that amazing i mean and the bible talks about wherever two or more gather in my name
they're all b and he said people don't receive because they asked and so we're imposing our
real power against the simulation and we're all part of that your viewers are part of it is the
matrix you're absolutely right they're creating a false cultural bullying matrix that's a haze
the real world's right here we all love each other we're all really here we have infinite

capitalism support of christianity support of family support of basic freedom huge memorial
day specials running throughout this weekend until the month of may ends and then for store
dot com and for his life dot com take advantage today you're listening to the alex jones show
he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side
you're listening to alex jones hollywood the big multinational corporations
and communist china that now control it are so nasty want to break america's will so badly
that they push too far and trump and and you and all of us and ali alexander are all a manifestation
of that resistance but earlier ali was talking about people having a right to stand up and resist
by voting or by political ideas or even physically if need be and i thought of the declaration of
independence july 4th 1776 that's what july 4th is all about i know we all know that but we really
consciously think about that recently they were going to have a commencement ball at one of the
buildings by independence hall and the principal apologized assault the news or was it a professor
i forget the the dean was either a college or high school assault last week he apologized for the
ticket saying party like it 1776 they said oh some people are hurt by that because 1776 is about
slavery no they almost got rid of it the first declaration and the first bill of rights and
constitution the west is what got rid of all that there it is principal apologize for party like
it's 1776 so it's all about virtue signaling but actually read what's in this listen how revolutionary
it is the anonymous declaration of 13 united states of america and then it goes through i'm not going
to read the whole thing but when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the political bands with which have connected them with another and to assume among
the powers of the earth the separate equal status station to which the laws of nature and gods
entitle them a decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare
the cause which impel them to the separation and then it goes through the usurpations the
criminal activity the behaviors and of course thomas jefferson wrote this the other guys approved
of it we hold these trees be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by
their creator with certain inalienable rights that among them are life liberty pursuit of happiness
that secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends
it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
laying its foundation on such principles and organizations in its powers in such form as to
them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness is trump doing that for you folks
prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light
and transient causes and accordingly all experience have shown that mankind are more disposed to
suffer while evils are sufferable than to write themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariable the same objective
invents as a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right as their duty to
throw off such government and provide new guards for their future security now thomas jefferson
grew up on his farm with a bunch of black people and then when he became the owner of it when his
dad died he tried to free them but there weren't laws to do it and he's on record trying to put
it in the first declaration and then the first bill of rights and then the first constitution
that came a decade later we didn't really have a government till they had to fight a war this was
just starting a war signed by john hancock hollywood the media they all particularly demonize
thomas jefferson now and say he was a racist because he had sex with the people he ended up
freeing and had children with him okay but he was also hated around the neighborhood for being
friendly to blacks so the guy that tried to free blacks because he was born into slavery he's the
bad guys so think about the level of that of the trailblazer of the idea of it's hard to change he
says that here but we've got to do it he tried it then it took 80 years till his vision happened
and then they take the real symbol of that trailblazing to be the first guy doing in his time and
turn into something bad alie alexander it's it's it's really it's really sad but when i sit when
i travel this country and i i talk to people and they're like well you know i'm not totally
convinced i said well in 20 years they're gonna be asking your children to denounce you while
you're still alive and that's gonna be like mal's great leap and people really need to appreciate
the school of thought that was going on then you had thomas hobs who said that man is inherently
bad and might need monarchy and you had john lock that said man is inherently good and we
deserve a republic or democracy well what thomas jefferson did is he kind of combined both of them
he said the people have a right to self-govern if the monarch is not doing well and as you just read
man is probably predisposed to do horrible things and our system is really the convergence of the
best ideas of both western and eastern civilization so and people don't know and you kind of alluded
to it we failed the first time with the articles of confederation so anyone who thinks oh well
america will be here all along and and media is journalism because they got tv's and notepads
it's not true corporate media is not journalism and we can fail again in america if we're not
willing to speak up and it's a little embarrassing it's a little weird to be talking about rosa and
bar and plan of the apes but we have to speak truth to power or we don't have the ability
to reason anymore we lose the best qualities of the enlightenment and the renaissance and i'm not
willing to go down like that well that's awesome that you're informed on all this and it's just
amazing i just don't get how they they turn a champion of somebody trying to free the slaves
early into the racist it's it's just great he was born into it he tried to end it and then he's the
bad guy it's farenheit 451 they've got a demantle all of history and then they tell you benjamin
franklin was the first firefighter and he was burning books you know instead of this great
author and he did establish the first fire department to put out fires so it's they're
really trying to dismantle all history so that they can retool and then they can tell us well
the democrats have always been good and the kkk was a republican thing and you know blacks need
to take a backseat uh now to you know uh uh you know what they want to do with south america and
mexico and and and push us all together it's economically looking into your crystal ball
alley alexander a smart guy uh what because i don't want to be too confident well let's look down
into some of the more dangerous paths i don't want to give many ideas but i mean how do you think
they could take out trump staging events false flags killing him i mean oh my god if they killed
him that would that would really blow up i don't want that to happen well um i i'm actually surprised
because something horrible has not happened yet uh we are in the trump leg of the uh the russia hopes
so that's the good thing the good news is that we're about to have a very eventful summer um people
are going to learn more of the realities of what's going on in the doj that the media has not told
you and by the way i was about to say you tried to get into whistleblowers i apologize to get into
that no no but but what what i think is that it's too late to take out trump but um they want to
disable him and so they're putting people around him who will lie to him um they're they're telling
him that he doesn't have this authority or that authority unfortunately mitch mcconnell is cooperating
with a lot of this and so they're really trying to disable him but if we can get past november and we
can maintain the house and the senate it's trump's show after that and i promise no one's seen nothing
yet i mean it will look like a renaissance in america that we have not it will it will probably
trump no pun intended the great awakening well my friend you're on fire and you're right it is the
patriots in our government outside it it's all about saying no to the intimidation the bullying
and the way you join trump right in the middle of the firestorm when when they were you know the
entire cover of national review was saying you can't go with him anybody that signs that'll be
blackballed forever well now national review is uh carrying trumps water more and more so
i agree i think trump so far is now one at least the first phase uh but but now they're gonna try
to sabotage him at every level yeah it's absolutely true and and and really i i would like for people
to say a prayer for some of these rank and file career uh fbi agents and then uh lawyers inside
the doj people don't understand that when some of these thugs started targeting trump's family he
was fine taking these these these uh metaphorical bullets but when they started saying we're gonna
lock up jerry kushner and his children are gonna grow up without a dad we're gonna lock up don jr
trump christmas eve uh what i'm told uh went ballistic and he decided then that he was gonna
fight fire with fire as much as he could and um thanks to him you know and david newness we got the
memo and what i heard after the memo was that uh we had additional people go to the ig so the
inspector general and start whistleblowing so think about it the the press is supposed to protect
whistleblowers the senator is supposed to protect whistleblowers and these people were so intimidated
by the the culture of corruption that comey created and the actual corruption that mccabe was
creating that they didn't want to speak up they thought there was no champion well trump said
i'll be a champion i'll protect my family and i'll protect yours that's right he took the gloves off
and just like every other tyrant over reaches they've done it again alie alexander very impressed
love your work please join us again soon i will that guy's on fire right there that's a real
intellectual not ben Shapiro again i'm not uh ben Shapiro isn't even the radar he tries to run
everything and i'm just sick of him he's so artificial hey i'ma start the next hour roger

you're listening to the alex jones show
relentlessly attacking the power structure you're listening to alex jones
here is what the enemy fears here is what in the dark of the night when they wake up
scared they're thinking about they're thinking about your energy they're thinking about your
will they're thinking about your strength they're thinking about your fighting spirit america has
always been a nation of fighters who never give up right we never give up ever right
never give up we're fighters like the amazing patients and families here today now as i proudly
signed then this is very personal for me but as i proudly sign this bill thousands of terminally ill
americans will finally have the help the hope and the fighting chance and i think it's going to be
better than chance that they will be cured that they will be helped that they'll be able to be
with their families for a long time or maybe just for a longer time
you know he said earlier in the speech he said this is very personal to me to get these cures in
melania has not been seen in 17 18 days and they said oh it's not malignant or kidneys
and i thought about something because i know a lot of eastern european folks
who grew up in that area and i went wait a minute i looked at the gas plume and when malania
was like about 12 years old
or so cher noble went right over her and i know men and women that are from that area of the world
and every person i know has had tumors i even know a woman that looks just like malania and she's
had tumors three of them removed the joke is you know she's all i do i glow in the dark
think about that and i'm not saying she's got something worse but
but trump for the first time ever got a little tear in his eye he says it's very personal for me
and the you know what trump it's it's it's serious you know silence a malania stokes conspiracy
theories was i thought i saw two days ago 17 days so it's like 19 days now that doesn't sound good
and god knows he they make fun of him eating McDonald's three times a day he has trusted
people to go to different McDonald's and get his food because you think he can trust the food he's
given you understand the level of the war we're in right now
and i'm not going to get off into it
but 18 years ago i went and spoke at a public event and i had feds trying to come up and say
hey you want to plant what's now 20 days well you understand hey you want to plant bombs
and all those stuff and i was like no no no and then i puffed all up that was back when i was
still exercising really hard running on everything and i finally got my blood tested
and they said yeah you got really bad levels arsenic in you and some jerk put arsenic at
a public event in my tea so you read about the kings and every culture where you know the old
roman emperors the japanese emperors the chinese emperors the african emperors everybody got poisoned
they had food tasters you think they're trying to poison trump you think there aren't jacking with
milania you think these people just don't coffee on top our heads they're out to get everybody and
i'm not bitching about it but i want everybody to recognize roger stone and i talked to people
that were involved he'd make this up i made him show me the stuff before they came to the gag
order and i knew they'd do it you had the fed show up he got shot last year he even know what it was
he goes yeah it slammed on my back he was like i can't find anything in me he got sick two days later
from radiation policing but he didn't go all the way in through his he went through the shirt and
deflected on his skin polonium they go oh look they killed the russian agent with polonium but it
deflected roger aged i'd be honest about 10 years after that but they hit him with and then they
t-boned him a few months later because they were going to blame him all along as the final guy he
predicted that and now they've honed in he's the final guy they want to set up think about that
they shoot you with polonium say that's how russians kill you and then set you up i'm telling you

point i want to make the late great david billy
i feel the wreck without my little child
shut your mouth i'll give you television i'll give you eyes blue i'll give you
you a system to rule the world
visions of swastikas

not i'll give you television i'll give you eyes the blue
i'll give you television i'll give you eyes the blue i'll give you a man that wants to rule the
world great song by david billy they would ban that probably on there today says i'll
that's visions of swastikas in my mind shut your mouth so that's what it comes down to
roger's taking over here but roger really ought to get into i guess it was last
january because i was getting married and trump had literally just called my wife
that day and then at like five a.m the next day my phone starts ringing
and roger is throwing up everywhere and he's been to the hospital and he's got polonium in his
blood and the fed show up and say don't talk about it and the media goes oh even though
the fed showed up and grabbed the hospital records and told him not to talk roger claims it oh roger
claims he's going to be the final guy they set up for russia gate that they want him dead so he
can't testify to congress and now he's the final guy he's the guy they admit they're circling in on
and it gets even better it gets even better they're now questioning army officers and others 13
people and they go no alex it's sinning in on you and that you're a mastermind too talk about insane
yeah i'm a mastermind when it comes to loving freedom and thinking you're going to want freedom
over tyranny but there's no master mining crap i believe in you we put the idea out we throw the
stone in the pond it comes back my mastermind i know when it's really still weather and you know
it's in the spring and if i go put some stink bait on the end of the line and throw it out at five
a.m in the morning by the time i'm done drinking my coffee i might catch that 20 pound catfish
i did this weekend i guess i am a mastermind i know that i don't go hunting the first week
if it isn't freezing you know everybody else is out trying to shoot a big buck i go out and look
where the big buck comes through and i'm going to wait till it has that first big cold snap
i'm going to get out there at three a.m so when it gets light at six a.m i'm going to shoot that
sucker i guess i am a mastermind but it didn't mean the russians told me like oh drain the swamp
lock hillary up hillary for prison where'd we oh putin gave me that idea but we're now in the
season this really freaked roger's wife out and she had some issues with the hospital i'm not saying
i did it but i said it because it's true we're in the season where they want to kill roger stone
and kill me i don't say that for drama my god 20 30 articles a day new york times rolling stone
shut alex jones the war on alex jones the legal war on alex jones all this crap all these lies
they print they're not doing this to ever win these lawsuits they are winding up their head teams
showing they kill me they go oh that's that son of a bitch that was mean to the sandy hook families
and all this made-up stuff so i don't say all this to protect us in the main for our own individual
selves i say it so that they don't twist the narrative if we get killed about what and who we
were because we're men and we're we're not going to turn on the president we're not going to make
things up against the president it's not going to happen and that's not even the story with all
that stuff it's it's it's this the alex jones presidency the new york times and you know the
war on alex jones the new republic it's here so this is where they're going and now that they're
failing in their rage they want the low hanging fruit that is roger stone alex jones but as the
wall street journal said three months ago now you know merging with disney they said we're
going to get wiki leaks we're going to get alex jones we're going to mix isis in and once we've
got them the left the next day had hundreds of articles oh the end of alex jones oh hold on to
your tin full hat youtube's about to ban alex jones and it began a month later and only drudge
sat there and showed we were being censored and showed the real video what we said so they wouldn't
even be defamed but i read this thing the the legal war on alex jones and it out of the new
republic and it's all these lies i didn't say it's not even quotes and it links to it just to
defame me hoping some crazy person see they accused me trying to send crazy people to harass
different groups out there they make that up but they are trying to send crazy people to kill us
and they think i'm like them they think that it's going to make me back down or go away it's
not but you make no mistake ladies and gentlemen we need you to flood info war store dot com with
orders and it's great product anyways we have free shipping on all the top sellers right now
and 50 percent of our main force we need to go to roger stones legal defense fund and give him
five dollars or go buy his book at info war store dot com stones rules you're already awake you're
like hey we already get this but we need you to continue to take action but even more importantly
we need you if they do kill us because i'm not worried about that i have responsibility i'm not
suicidal i love life but at the same time there's this thing when you're a man you get to a certain
point where you've already done so much stuff that responsibility is a big weight and you want to live
a long time but at the same time you're not scared of dying it's it's it's it's it's real empowerment
you just want to take care of your family after you're gone and you also wish you could keep fighting
you know what i mean but you're not going to let them have the victory if they kill you but see i
studied secret assassinations just my research and one of the main things the cia and other groups
do is they have gelatin darts and they can put any poison they want in them and then they shoot you
with a gelatin dart it's going to shoot you up close and then it dissolves into your body
that just looks like background stuff so it doesn't pick up so it pierces you but then it dissolves
they also have ice bullets and things we got to shoot somebody up closer with that and so roger
just spend a few minutes then whatever topics you've got to take over here because i got the
woods are lovely dark and deep my friend i want to stay home with you but i got miles ago before
i sleep i know you do too as well but talk about the day you're out there wasn't your nephew and
get shot in the back with the with because you didn't even our state said it hit you or bleeding
then you got sick the next day vomiting on your hospital polonium poisoning but thank god it didn't
go all the way in it deflected on the surface maybe you got 20 of the dose probably took some
years off your life but you survived so tell folks what that was like well alex i know the
liberals like to make light of this but um oh you're just the number one target and everything
else but oh yeah but you got shot in the back yeah yeah you know back around the time that i was
writing uh the manuscript for the making of the president 2016 which outlines the extraordinarily
important role that info wars and other alternative media outlets played in the improbable election
of dialed from i clearly got exceedingly ill i believe that i was hit by some kind of pride
projectile uh this is not just you know an overnight you described it it slapped into your shirt put a
hole in the shirt what happened uh well i had within days i had lesions on my chest and on my face
night sweats but we're gonna go to break come back with something tell me what you told me what
happened describing the how it slapped you in the back the bleeding what happened you know what the
hell it was i felt this like almost like a bug bite in my back all the sudden sharp and then
there's nothing really there and i thought well maybe i was hit by a mosquito or spider or something
and of course immediately i got ill look uh there is no question right now uh big big story in
washington all over washington about the fact that i had been called now to testify for the senate
intelligence committee this is actually not news this is old news i relish the opportunity

from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones watch me watch me i got it
watch me i got it hey i got something i got something that makes me want to show
i know i got something that tells me what it's all about i get you i got so i'm super bad super
bad i know i feel it to my friend i got so all the energy and i'm super bad i just can't help it
sometimes i gotta move i gotta move it tells me what to do i want to tell myself
amazing and i'm super bad the immortal james brownberg is in all right roger you're taking over
you've been called to the senate committee you knew it was coming they ignore all your
statements on it and then when it happens they go oh look roger's in trouble oh he's called before
him so all this is happening you're gonna be in studio next week hosting at least two days of
the broadcast they are making me get out of the combat operation because i've gotten the point
where i'm literally working 18 hours a day even from home i can't stop i can't do anything but work
now so i'm gonna have to pull my engine for at least a week and so i'm gonna try my best uh take
my babies sunbathing and fishing but i'll still be doing broadcast uh from the road uh just briefly
listeners it's the epic future it's here it's real people like send me emails and make donations
down they go i thought you were kidding that sorrelson hillary was suing you and it's like the
democrats number one mission is to destroy you i actually read the wall street journal i actually
read the new republic i why do they think you're so powerful i'm not they want to set the precedent
with me to then destroy everybody else they've said it show voila the biggest thing we need
is money they're censoring us they're blocking us they're banning us from advertising in four store
dot com enforce life dot com but it's not about that if you just knew how good the products are
if you just knew that nobody else puts as much product in here for the price that we do
do everybody else does marketing and then it's marked up seven times on average ours is a hundred
fifty percent off retail but we're always discounting so it's normally a hundred percent right now
we got stuff at fifty percent markup some of it's lower let me explain what that means you get some
of these products will sell right now and you do auto ship so ten percent soft some of them are
breaking even nobody does that but i want to say i've got the best nutraceuticals at the best
prices at the lowest prices when you buy it retail which they never read we're always twenty five percent
off this is my own weird philosophy i didn't take marketing i just i do what i want to do i'll
operate i know you want to see it's discounted so i already have a super low price hundred
fifty percent markup average is seven times markup and then i cut it down twenty five percent off
so off the total price it's like a hundred percent markup and when i discount it's off that
right now folks some of these are right at cost try brain force try the real red pill plus now
with energy try these products info or store.com but no you can't lose because you're funding the
information war it's quite an epic battle quite frankly my life is not boring it's very very exciting
info or store.com thank you all for your support read the thousands reviews per item uh because
it's incredible but get some t-shirts while you're at it so you can experience what it's like to
meet the patriots but also to see the enemy first on wear the uniform wear your colors fly your flag
go out you go in a red state area your dinner bot might meet your next wife or your husband or your
boyfriend but you wear it in the deep blue area you will be attacked so prepare yourself choose
your own adventure all right so you got a lot to cover my friend but i want to finish up with you
in this segment you take over um you're coming in here a few days next week to be hosting i want
shroyers doing a great job as well the rest of the crew paul be back from vacation everybody's
like where's paul you know he's with tony robinson you know he's going down here paul's got the same
disease working 18 hours a day so he had to take off a week just so happened to be when this was
happening uh the epicness of you though now being the epicenter and confirming orbiting that they're
saying the fbi that you and i are the masterminds with trump and they're now leaving the russian
narrative and saying that that no no no it's an american conspiracy so that's the two prong attack
for my sources roger have you got any intel on that yeah i really have alex it gets more bizarre
by the moment uh again months ago i agreed to testify for the house and uh pardon me for the
senate intelligence and judiciary committees they have given us a document request that is so
onerous so broad i am not exaggerating when i tell you that it will fill three tractor trailers
full of paper but that's what they want and that is what they shall have uh there's no smoking guns
in there if they're looking for the smoking gun it doesn't exist because there is no russian collusion
but as you'll recall when i testified for the house committee i wanted to testify in public let
the people see everything i have nothing to hide but no they wanted me to testify behind closed doors
so they could then leak twisted bs right then when i did well what happens then but adam schiff
and eric swalwell and the other democrats in the house democratic caucus say why didn't stone
testify in public he's perjured himself well if people would be allowed to hear me speak they would
see graphically that i testified fully completely and honestly this is the washington charade so uh i
am more than happy to testify for the senate intelligence committee and the senate uh judiciary
committee but i want to thank my friends at cnn who go out of their way to find the very worst
photographs of me that they can possibly find it is so obvious and annoying there you go perfect
example it doesn't even look like you it kind of looks like me i look like uh far more handsome than
that i guarantee you so uh look there i i hope that they will listen to my request to testify in
public it will be an extraordinary democratic experience uh and i'm calling on my supporters
once we nail down the date in june uh if you're a supporter of donald trump if you're a supporter of
roger stone if you're a supporter of info wars if you're a supporter of alex jones come to washington
i want to see you in washington in numbers there is strength i have nothing whatsoever to hide i do
get kind of tired of answering the same question over and over and over again that's my next question
where is this going our listeners just think of russia gate but now it's coming to a head so it's
important that's why i'm uncovering it there's nothing there and now to learn from all these
witnesses we've talked to on unfair they're like tell us how jones and stone did this and tell us
how they run the whole thing and it's like i want to build myself up don't get me wrong but
this is cuckoo land they don't understand we have shared beliefs they don't get we have audiences
that are americana they really think we're all like their average leftist slave oh and they ask
questions like how often do jones and stone talk on the phone do they talk on signal do they talk on
what's that is stone writing jones the material alex nobody writes your material somebody should be
you know what do they like to drink what do they like to eat where do they hang out how often do
you think they talk i mean these are unconstitutional questions maybe they're unfamiliar with the free
assembly aspects of the constitution anyway we're on the alex jones show i'm roger stone that's alex
jones and we will be right back that's right he'll take over what they don't get is it's all on air
that there's no secrets that there's no secrets like we love america we love free market we're
kicking your ass see how that works the country's coming back we're just stay with us want revenge

and now your host roger stone welcome back we're on the alex jones show and as i indicated the big
news out of washington a glaring headline on the daily beast us senate intelligence committee
wants to grill roger stone no roger stone wants to grill the us senate intelligence committee
this really grows tedious i don't know how many times i have to answer the same questions about
wiki leaks and gooseifer 2.0 and uh john podesta's emails and so on i've answered these questions
ad nauseam there is no evidence whatsoever of wrongdoing just to be absolutely clear i had no
advance notice of the content source or the exact disclosure deadline for the wiki leaks
disclosures regarding the dnc uh and i had no advance notice of the publication of john podesta's
extraordinarily embarrassing emails we recognize that this entire controversy is designed to distract
from the content of those completely authentic disclosures and then more recently randy credico
a former friend of mine goes on msnbc two nights ago and says julie anassange is willing to be
questioned by the house democratic investigators under the direction of congressman adam schiff
immediately congressman schiff says the only way he'd be willing to question or interrogate
mr russage is if he's in u.s custody which is somewhat troubling because there are no known
federal charges pending against mr russage unless of course mr schiff knows something that we
don't know and then wiki leaks comes forward and says credico was never authorized to make
such an offer this is a second lie that mr credico has been caught in the whole thing
grows extraordinarily tedious there is no russian collusion i received nothing whatsoever from the
uh from wiki leaks or the russians or julie anassange therefore i passed nothing on to
donald trump or the trump campaign or anyone in the trump family uh and that includes receiving
anything from the russians whoever that is they have beat this horse to death why because they
are the ones who are guilty because they used a fabricated dossier as the underlying legal rationale
for unconstitutional spying on the republican candidate for president and as we now know and
was first revealed here on info wars the fbi infiltrated donald trump's presidential campaign
now the washington post in the new york times would have us believe that they did so to search
for evidence of russian collusion no they did so to play it faux evidence of russian collusion
as part of what peter struck called in his text messages their insurance policy this is the greatest
constitutional crisis in american history and the idea that rod rozenstein the acting attorney general
the de facto attorney general refuses to turn over to congress the documents that outline
where mr muller's authority comes from the fact that he refuses to turn over to the congress the
details of the fisa warrants that were leveled on multiple members of the trump campaign well that
is sedition you see a u.s citizen can only be subject to a fisa warren if they are actively
involved in espionage on behalf of the foreign power against the united states this entire scandal
makes watergate look like well a second rate burglary you see there's a difference is quite clear
in the case of watergate nixon went down because he got caught having his campaign people spy on
the opposition and because his campaign people infiltrated the campaign of his opponents but
they at least used private individuals in this case the obama administration used the awesome power
and the authority and the capability of the federal government to spy on the republican
candidate for president how long will it be before the president's patients are exhausted
it i am one who thinks there's been a great improvement in the president's response to all
of this since he got himself a wartime conciliary in rudy juliani rudy juliani rusty is better than
his previous lawyers because juliani has very effectively characterized the muller inquiry
as a partisan witch hunt and we are in a situation where a terrific paper by professor
steven calabrese yesterday of northwestern university outlines the unconstitutional
underpinnings of muller's very appointment so if i am right and if having come up empty-handed with
no evidence of russian collusion no evidence of witty leaks hijinks and robert muller seeks to
frame me uh for some concocted offense in an attempt to leverage my testimony against the
president as political has predicted let me say right now john dean i am not i will never
betray this president i will never roll on this president i will never backstab this president
unlike so many others in washington but they're counting on the fact that i don't have the money
to fight this federal legal juggernaut and that's why i must appeal to you to go to stone defense
fund dot com stone defense fund dot com and make a generous contribution now alex jones and i are
working together to put together a joint info wars legal defense fund because he is facing
the same kind of challenges make no mistake about it this sandy hook lawsuit is designed
to destroy alex jones to take him off the air to shut info wars down to take us off of youtube
off of facebook off of twitter off of yahoo it is nothing less than an effort to snuff out
our first amendment rights it's part and parcel of the same exact strategy they have hit me with
frivolous harassment lawsuits by the democratic national committee by uh by employees of the
dnc where i'm being sued not for hate speech not for defamatory speech not for false speech
but for constitutionally protected free speech they want to gag alex jones they want to gag
info wars they want to gag roger stone they don't want us to talk about robert muller's record as a
federal prosecutor they don't want us to talk about the egregious corruption of the clinton crime
family no this is all designed to shut us down so therefore right now go to the info wars dot

to roger stone on info wars thank you very much mr president if you're reading the news uh
president richard nixon's home western white house in san clementine now on the market
for 6.3 million dollars i only wish i read an extraordinary article in the intercept called
bread to suffer about the extraordinary medical experiments that are being conducted on man's
best friend that's right dogs and cats who are being subject to some of the most brutal torture
the most bizarre quasi medical experiments that you can possibly imagine oh and shawyer and i at
the war room have been in the forefront working with the very good people at white coat labs project
to stop this inhumane treatment of man's best friend but this story absolutely blew my mind
to find out that the federal government abused over 60 000 dogs last year and over 820 000
thousand individual innocent animals the kind of experiments we're talking about are nauseating
having holes drilled in their heads so to be filled with drugs subjecting them to crystal
meth uh subjecting them to toxic fumes uh removing their eyes removing their vocal cords and then
of course refusing to let anybody uh adopt these animals this is a disgrace the white house telephone
number 2024561414 let's put it up here 2024561414 please call the white house now and ask them to
stop the inhumane bizarre treatment of man's best friend and the experiments on dogs by the
federal government these experiments have no scientific value whatsoever and they must stop
one thing i was remiss about yesterday uh was to mention how proud i was to see uh president
trump talk about our american veterans and those who have given their lives in their service of
their country one individual stands out who is still with us and must be acknowledged as a true
american hero my old boss senator bob dole of kansas 91 years old recently received the congressional
medal of honor a true american patriot when the bush family turned tail and abandoned
donald trump 91 year old bob dole was storming barnstorming through the midwest lining up
votes for the republican ticket god bless you senator dole you are a true american hero
now i want to remind you again that uh the expanded programming here whether it's the
war room uh with with my colleague oan schreuer which comes on shortly or whether it's the iconic
alex joneshow midday every day where history is made or whether it's david night's terrific
program real news in the morning and so much more that we have planned is only possible through your
loyal patronage at the info wars dot com store and i have kind of a selfish recommendation for you
this is the very best place for you to buy a copy of my new book stones rules now if you buy
stones rules at the info wars dot com store and you send your copy to me at your expense i will
gladly autograph it and send it back to you at my expense that's right you can get an autograph copy
of the book that i am most proud this is a book that is my rules of the road this is my book of
maxims and guidelines that can be used by any men or women who want to get ahead in life
whether it is a business or politics or media or fashion or agriculture or any application
this book is for you it's not ideological it's not philosophical although you will certainly
see my politics this is a book that is about success manners style food fashion automobiles
you name it it's a book you must have now i had this book made in a particularly heavy stock
because frankly i'm hoping that people will mark it up they'll dog hear it they'll go back and look
at it again and again for solid advice get your copy of stones rules at the info wars store now
at the very best price and it'll be my great honor to sign it and send it back to you thank you so
very much there is a limited availability uh so please go to the info wars dot com store now
and order your copy of stones rules there's a little question that i am going to be called
before the senate intelligence committee what they don't seem to understand is that i relish
this opportunity that i want to testify i'd also like to testify in front of the senate
judiciary committee but i don't see what there is to hide why can't we have these proceedings
in open like the watergate hearings or the army mccarthy hearings of the 1950s what are they
trying to hide i'd like to take on frontally the entire question of russian collusion i'd like
to destroy the myths about alex jones and roger stone and how we are plotting with latimer putin
to win the election because this is nonsense of course i'm guessing they will want me to testify
behind closed doors that way the democrats can come out of the meeting and leak things you didn't say
put words in your mouth cast aspersions on your remarks i've seen this graphically in the house
committee hearings where members of the minority said that stone didn't answer certain questions no
i answered every single question honestly and truthfully so as soon as we know a june day and
it appears it will be in june because the documents that the senate intelligence committee
has requested will fill three trailer trucks full of paper and they need some time to digest
that material i will be more than happy come to washington and lay it all out for the american
people in fact i'm already beginning to think about what i'm going to wear i really hope
that this opportunity comes to pass and that the senate in its wisdom will allow this hearing to
be in public in the meantime one more time remember that we faced the greatest fight in info wars
history there is an insidious globalist plot run by the tech left that intends to shut us down
when i take the buy link from amazon or info wars or barns and noble and i seek to put it into a paid
facebook promotion well my ad is rejected how could that be there's no inappropriate content
in my book no this is an insidious effort to kneecap anyone on the right they're doing it to alex
jones they're doing it to oan schreuer they're doing it to david night they're doing it to roger
stone they're doing it to millie weaver they're doing it to the entire crew here at info wars
don't let them get away with it folks here's what you can do when you see a story at info wars that
you really like one that rings your bell one you think is interesting take that link and send it
out to others and send it again and again and again they can silence me but they cannot silence
all of us and that is what they are counting on so whether it is the coverage of today's controversy
regarding rosa and bar or whether it is the truth of what's happening to tommy robinson
or whether it is the efforts to uh let us say shadow ban alex jones tell people in your circle
by taking those links put them on your facebook page put them in your twitter feed put them up on
gab put them up on minds spread the word as i said before they can silence me but they cannot
silence all of us thank you and god bless you and please stop by the info wars dot com store
we need your support victory or death
