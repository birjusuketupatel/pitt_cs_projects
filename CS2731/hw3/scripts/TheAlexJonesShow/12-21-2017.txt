Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones I woke up at
about 3 30 in the morning last night and I couldn't go back to sleep and I
wrote down some notes of course I've forgotten left at the house but it was
profound and it was extremely simple and it's something we've already talked
about before but it gets lost in everything the globalists don't want
us celebrating Christmas or anything else that's old and cultural because they
want to remove everything and force feed their new systems that's why they're
at war with everything traditional and most things traditional are traditional
because they're nice and they work and they're productive and they're happy and
they punish badness and reward goodness but once you flip the balance into evil
it becomes an evil economy and things just go downhill you want to stay away
from an evil economy and go towards a good one doesn't mean you're ever going
to be in some utopia but you want to be going towards the good in the spectrum
and it just hit me that as libertarians as patriots as constructive people we
tend to have victories move on it's that quiet professionalism you know that you
see in so many hard-working smart great people is they're confident they don't
need to sit there and tell you about it all day because they just are and
everybody picks up on it women pick up on it men pick up on it I mean that's
it that's when you got what it takes the right stuff and other people don't
and the folks that don't have the right stuff they're always trying to get
together to take over the people that do and then we're always trying to help
the people that don't have the right stuff now the globalists don't have the
right stuff they've stolen power but they think we don't have the right stuff
now want to kill us off because we don't want to play along with their ball game
so it's a it's a perversion but that said it hit me we've got to celebrate
these tax cuts and I mean really celebrate them and we've got to show
how good they are on average I had a chance to read over last night again
this morning when I woke up for about an hour hundreds of bullet points in there
but there's more than 30 big ones and it's I mean one of the cleanest tax bills
I've ever seen it's got some port barrel in there but not one Democrat voted for
it which is completely shameful and even a few Democrats on CNN had to come out
and say you know what this is really this really is a middle-class tax cut you
can't lie about it the ultra-rich already wrote the laws to keep their money
offshore Trump just undid the central plank of the globalist taking the money
offshore and that's why I get viciously angry when I see Hillary Clinton and
Michael Moore and all the usual suspects lying and playing on people's
ignorance I mean it really makes me mad the big banks and the ultra-rich the
fortune 100 to a group wrote the 40 percent or 38.9 percent tax the big
corporations wrote it and I sit there with leftist as they go oh are you glad
you're rich friends Alex we're gonna get that big tax cut people just walk
mindset mystery oh you're working with the rich people now know you buffoon the
ultra-rich wrote it to screw you you pay all the taxes shock even CNN admits
tax bill gives working families damn good money 1.5 trillion baby in fact it
even got rid of some of the tax exemptions for people making over a
million dollars a year if anything it's a tax increase on nouveau rich believe me
you're making a million bucks a year that that's not ultra-rich it's not one
percent that has 70% of money it's we've done the math it's point zero zero
zero zero zero zero zero zero four two of them resurface like a whole bunch of
zeros and then four two so it's the point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
zero zero whatever four two that are ruling the show and they want a monopoly
they want consolidation under Democrat globalist control all over the world you
see middle-classes shrink and the ultra-rich created it's the ultra-rich
to a man and to a corporation very few women that are promoting this global
socialist system because they're exempt from it they transfer your wealth take
it for themselves and Trump and all of us just blew a giant hole in it and the
EU is panicking the EU admits it's gonna move our jobs back they're
threatening us too why is the fungus why is the mold why is the yeast taking

look at the response we're getting whoever changed the world together you
are the info war God bless you all. Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming
to you live from the front lines of the info war I couldn't fleet at about 3 30
the morning I got up because my brain was racing and I got up and wrote a
bunch of notes but again I of course forgot left on the kitchen table
breakfast table when I came into work today when I came into this war today
and I'm very honored and very humbled to be a part of and it was so clear it was
all laid out right there and again all of it you're already gonna know I don't
tell you anything you don't already know in your heart reason you listen and put
up with me at the time the show's a train wreck because of myself because you
know deep down I am in this with you and you are in this with me and that's why
they always attack and say I'm not real and I hate my listeners when I get tears
in my eyes when families run up to me and shake my hand black Hispanic white
you name it Asian old young because they're counting on me and I feel weak in
in this fight sometimes because I know so much more and I don't have the energy
or the skill to properly execute perform operations that I know would turn
everything around but I'm not the only person you're not the only person
Trump's not the only person and now as we realize we're here and that there
aren't just scum in the world there aren't just backstabbers in the world
there aren't just vicious liars in the world the worm is turning and evil is
panicking they were all so sure that they were gonna bring in this global
government it isn't just Hillary that's failing the globalist said last year in
major publications in their establishment publications they said
emergency red alert they knew internal polls had trump 10 15 points ahead they
stole we now know over 7 million votes not three and a half like Trump had
earlier been told off of pure research Harvard research it's over 7 million
Hillary stole six tapes of five states tried to steal six others and we have
all the evidence of that local state Homeland Security caught just
department breaking in with their cyber squads trying to flip the votes and
stopped them so there's a civil war going on against the globalists that have
hijacked the nation and those of us try to take it back it doesn't mean those of
us on the side of trying to bring sovereignty back are perfect or that
any of the people that have even joined us are perfect a lot of them can see
which way the wind's blowing and now as people realize we're going to win it's
going to accelerate the victory and the globalists now know they're going to
lose for good they finally realized it in the last 48 hours and I can feel their
horror I could see their response I could see people jumping ship even faster
this is the moment the president's got to be under maximum security everybody
else has got to be under maximum guard watch your six right now because right
now yesterday when that bill passed and they went up there and had that
celebration it was absolutely we turn the corner right there we turn the corner
right there that I mean we turned all the corners it didn't mean that we're
perfect I mean we don't have a lot of big crises to face North Korea you name
it but spiritually what started without inauguration 11 months ago and that
declaration bringing God back in the covenant saying it's about humanity it's
about workers it's about the people you you're not just the people or the
minority or the infighting group you're the people you're the workers you're the
builders you're the strivers that that it was invoking God and then saying you
are the celebration you have value it isn't just hype it's what builds a
culture and then now less than a year later so many promises delivered the
globalists are in full panic mode and so we need to celebrate and be thankful
for everything we've got being thankful and I know I'm preaching to most of you
that already know this but to others being thankful is the answer to being
happy and being honorable is the key to real wisdom and the globalists are
always going to attack those of us to stand up against them and say that we're
the dishonorable ones we're the liars we're the bad ones and cobble things
together and twist what we've done or take points when we fall in and try to
magnify that to to make us all feel like we don't have a right to be free but
it's all a lie it's all a false indictment by the accuser by the devil
and that's what the spirit is that's why they always say Jones doesn't believe
what he's saying Jones isn't real Jones is an actor because they they don't want
you to believe there's anybody else out there the things like you do they're
saying you're not real real reason they fear me is they know I'm real and they
know I'm committed and they know I have will to stand against what they've done
thanks to God but when to my sales and they can't stand that and of course the
proof is the pudding judge tree by its fruits we are destroying the globalists
we are breaking their corrupt world government we are exposing the
technocracies we are unmasking and unveiling their monopolies we are
causing together a global accelerated awakening that has evil everywhere in a
panic and desperately coming out of their rat holes out of their spider
holes out of their eel holes to fire us now which only accelerates their defeat
as we draw their fire that's the key to this they've now come into our keep come
into our castle to destroy us in the night and just like Beowulf we're
waiting and as they try to flee we slam their arm in the door and rip it off
we've still got to face other great events but the point is this particular
monster has already had its arm torn off and is bleeding to death and its
mother is going to fall next because we are going into the mountain next where
they molest the children where they engage in the Satanism where they carry
out their operations we are going into the mountain and if some of us are
destroyed going to the mountain doesn't matter for more of us will follow and it
won't be fear going to the mountain it will be honor and the quest for liberty
and freedom and an honor to go into the mountain into the enemy's own darkness
because we carry the light of Christ in our hearts ladies and gentlemen the EU
has completely uncloaked the grandson of the main Nazi fortune Junker who owns a
country they hijacked in World War two Luxembourg I mean just the arrest him
immediately just of the arrogant insanity of these people snaggle tooth
Nazi says no you violated international treaties you can't cut taxes under
world government combines we've signed with you at the WTO you can't do this
you're gonna move back all the jobs to the United States and raise your wages
they actually admit that trumps for real the articles are on enforce.com with
just screenshots of London Guardian your spiegel EU fears unfair US tax bill
will incentivize companies to move to America and then I've got one right here
out of the Associated Press where they announced and CNBC that you violate a
global agreement let's pull that up there it is US tax reform breaks global
rules EU says oh there's global rules where do you get rules from a government
been talking to us like we're five year olds for 50 years while you set up
world government stealth and as we said all they got to do is expose it people
attack us saying it doesn't exist but when they finally go operational
everybody will go what you said this wasn't going on the only people that
bought the Kool-Aid and drank it was the globalist and sure they've stolen
trillions and those other crap they've got Hollywood
diseases everything and brainwashing people but that's the weak victims and
we're sad for them but the thinking man and woman has got it and they know and
the whole world's like how dare you we sucked America dry with big companies
they didn't help people in Mexico or people in China with this crud they
exploited them they lowered global wages giant sucking sound downward America was
dragging the world up free market was dragging it up higher standards of
living people wanting more people wanting to live better living longer but
Obama and them go to the third world say you can't have cars you can't have
record issues these are the very ones and they're going what did you just do
you're gonna give 1.5 trillion American people we had our shoe on their neck we
had them right where we wanted them you're not psychos like us you're stupid
what's wrong with you you're supposed to be vicious and lying and evil and hate

dot com that's info wars store com you're listening to the alex jones show so the
globalist tell you the liberty movement fake it's a fraud it won't deliver live
from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones they're the ones that
deliver tyranny and starvation and impoverished populations and oppressed
peasantries they're the ones that deliver racial division culture war they're
the ones that deliver the sexualization of children and 50 plus percent of black
people never been born they're the fake left of the tyrants of the parasites
there's people that tell you they're coming to take care of you but really
they're gonna domesticate you and turn you into a slave we're delivering on the
free market renaissance enlightenment americana that pulled the world out of
the dark ages and put us on the road to the stars extended life and the secrets
of the universe that our father is ready for us to enjoy but we have to prove
ourselves we won't just be given the keys to the galaxy and the keys to the
universe without first being tested and that's what this is make no mistake that's
why the enemy coveted that's why they hate humanity the globalist are fallen
twisted souls that seek to make greater men and women their slaves always
seeking ever hungry for the blood of the innocence and I think about how the
media all over Twitter Facebook everywhere I wasn't even looking for it and
I saw a look at Tim Scott the uncle Tom you know the beautiful part about our
rallies is about half the folks there quote minorities the media panicked
about that when we had one at the RNC they said yes it's very frightening
half the folks there were black or Hispanic or Asian like more than that
everybody got along great but see by telling you oh blacks aren't welcome in
the Republican Party or in the Tea Party then blacks don't go that's like
the White House Chief of Staff Kelly came out and said we're looking for all
qualified applicants please you know if you're a minority we're not getting
minority request here we just want competent people so and see that's how
that self-segregation works and now the colleges are teaching women don't go
around men men don't wear on women blacks go over here Hispanics over here
whites over here they're setting up a prison and then hyping up stuff and
staging false hate crimes and then Tim Scott who had tears in his eyes
talking about President Trump who it's real affirmative action and if you
really want to do it even though it discriminates either has been past
problems but it's actually teach somebody how to fish don't give them fish
they're gonna deploy want to say racially massive extra funding for
factories jobs and businesses into black areas which is good for the country
good for everybody we need to lift these folks up that have been on a
Democrat plantation for 200 plus years they just put them on a new one when
LBJ figured out blacks were running their own businesses and becoming too
wealthy and so they've come out a bunch of an attack Tim Scott called an uncle
Tom he actually read Uncle Tom Uncle Tom wasn't a wimp he was a Christ figure
doesn't mean you don't always lay down you don't always stand up no one to
hold him no one to fold him but that Christ figure could Christ wasn't a
wimp at that point or Gandhi wasn't a wimp or Martin Luther King wasn't a wimp
I mean Martin Luther King you call it Uncle Tom he got killed being loving and
being a good person of course they so people don't know what Uncle Tom means
because the Democrats took it and turned it into a purjorative by the 1870s look
up who did it I wanted to check my memory so it read up on the history this
morning again they flip everything you got the blacks running towards the KKK
party because they don't know any better because they've been lied to by the
schools like everybody else that know any better so it's it's just incredible
ladies and gentlemen and of course it was Uncle Tom's cabin that moved
everybody to finally embrace abolitionist and not want to have slavery
anymore it was that book about the Christ figure Uncle Tom that actually triggered
all of that and by the end of the Civil War millions of dead by the end to stop
slavery wasn't started over that but see they take that victory away from you and
say oh he was a bad pathetic person that groveled and everything he was
servile he was always other things well if you're in front of all the cameras
and your enemies about to kill you it destroys them when they kill you was
Obi-Wan Kenobi and went at the end when he let Darth Vader chop him in half no
he knows it's about to commit the next generation of the fight he's done at this
point he's also gonna buy some time and again that's fiction Uncle Tom's fiction
but it helps people understand what real heroism is at the point that you need
to let people kill you if you're the spirit decides the time then you don't
fight you let them kill you because it brings them down because an hour later
you blow up the Death Star those are all allegories of how things really work
Martin Luther King blew up the Death Star
Charlton Heston marching with him to help end real racism blew up the Death Star
those that got blown up came back with hey we'll take control of these people
this way and they've done it and they've taught racism and horrible wickedness and
horrible vicious attacks by black people against whites and others all over the
place ten to one twenty to one thirty to one depending on the city and the
media covers it up and they won't you see it it's not the demonized blacks it's
to say what you're doing is wrong just like KKK doing stuff that's wrong stop
it it's evil because most people aren't psychopaths they make excuses for why
they go out most people that were KKK weren't psychopaths they were bought
into it they were manipulated into it same thing with blacks that now act like
the KKK but in a much wider scale of true persecution but see it's all okay
because the old KKK people that control the KKK are in control of you they
weren't believe in any of that stuff people that control the KKK they wanted
to control the poor farmers that were their real competition by putting them
into a secret society group they could control a gang see these people know what
they're doing these the parasites are very very smart let's go out to break
with Tim Scott that they hate so much because it's like a Moses to lead black
folks off the plantation and we'll come back with a powerful video that McBreens
put together because Trump is going to now go after the welfare system they're
gonna say that they're killing everybody but that's not what's happening we're
literally taking people and not letting them be domesticated from the company
store like they had whites of slaves as sharecroppers here it is Mr. President
during one of those conversations that we had we talked about ways to improve
distressed communities throughout this country 52 million Americans living in
distressed communities and we talked about legislation that can move those
communities forward and you said yes and as a part of this tax reform package
the investing and opportunity act has been included which will bring
trillions of dollars into poor communities because of your willingness to
listen you know they say Tim Scott's so young and so I only have about 45 probably
gonna be the next like president my long time okay let me just say to those
Americans who are watching this process this is not about Washington it's not
about the left it's not about the right it's about single parent moms who are
looking for a reason to be hopeful in 2018 this tax reform plan delivers for
the average single mother a 70 percent tax cut for the average family who's
working paycheck to paycheck looking for ways to be hopeful about their future
to have an extra night for dinner out at a restaurant this tax reform package
cuts their taxes by nearly 60% and because of folks like Marco Rubio and
Ivanka when you think about the folks with kids in the household this plan
doubles the child tax credit will be back to what else hey Daniel Brieman why

of the top CNN hosts has been forced to come out and admit it's up on info wars
dot com the video and the tweet I'm gonna play that video coming up if I
didn't mention to get that the crew we're even even CNN admits that it helps
working families in this damn good money CNN's John King tax cut bill gives damn
good money to work in class CNN host praises bill passed with zero
Democrat support wonder how long John King is gonna be there by the way I had
that in my stack but I can't find what you guys reprint it for me get the video
I'm sure we do but that's that's pretty powerful information because it's 1.5
trillion and most of it goes to middle-class and working families the
big banks big insurance companies the big portion 100 pay almost no tax they've
written the laws to be offshore and Trump annihilated that with a cut from
thirty eight point nine percent on corporations to 15 now what you've got
to understand ladies and gentlemen why this is such a big deal I know I keep
harping I know you know this most of you please tell your friends and family
because this is key the UN the globalist all of them are running around
saying that oh look Trump's breaking global rules there are no global rules
the rules are screw America and the West over transfer power to authoritarian
countries where globalists that sold our countries out ally themselves with the
other authoritarians it's authoritarian monopoly men and crony capitalist and
communist dirtbags against the Renaissance against the real liberals
if you really study what it is under classical analysis if Thomas Jefferson
was looking at this he'd say those are monopoly groups just like a royal system
but worse there's not even any honor nobody has to even take the field in the
elite and they are putting us under serfdom anybody that was classically
trained would see it two seconds if you're classically educated you got to
go back and educate yourself on the classics not the modern baloney
intellectuals were too arrogant 300 400 500 years ago to lie they might be
distorted in their views but they told you what they thought this whole lying
on purpose in media is a newer thing in the last 200 years or so because before
200 years ago most people the printing press was 500 but it wasn't ubiquitous
until or most people reading until about 200 years ago it was only
intellectual intellectual elite to elite so they were all very out in the open
and they still do that in globalist publications with each other that like
we're idiots would never read it we went read it and brought everybody said look
there's they're saying this they're gonna do this oh shut up you racist cook
nutball whatever you know just shut up go away but I'm like hey that you found
that the public did listen
we'll play the McBrain piece when we come back to the next segment I'm already burning
through this segment but how long is that piece also I see I have this whole
thing where they did this great job on these promos on the other side but then
I get a video list that tells me the length but then those videos never get
put on the video list with this group so then I don't ever know the only reason
I'm staying on air is I've asked about 200 times I'm asking nicely for just an
email to be sent or it's a message everybody's doing a great job so that I
can then know the length of time so I'm just asking on air because a lot of
folks think you know I'm just asking these things on there to pontificate for
no reason that just goes into the whole computing process of what to do and I'm
kind of teleproport free so what we do is kind of strategize here on air which
is not a bad thing just most folks don't do that they this whole dry fake thing
you know pointed right at you but here it is we'll cover more when we come back
EU fears unfair US tax bill will incentivize companies to move the US move
back and they say we're breaking global rules well if China has 14 and a half or
whatever it is and then we've got a 38.9 and our own government wrote it that
way to make the jobs go to China you wonder why everything went there well
they had a tax rate less than half of ours and then you wonder why everybody
launder their money through Ireland and move even more jobs there so they had
zero remember the big success story Ireland it's incredible and Trump tried
to get zero if we had zero corporate income tax everyone would come back here
just like it was before we set this whole thing up and we had you 80% of the
world's industry by the 80s it was half of it now it's like 20% of it within
five years you'd have half the stuff moved back here at real wages and then
that would lift the whole world up every economist knows this but they they want
a consolidation I know I keep harping and harping and harping and harping it's
because this is everything a rigged political and corporate system to screw
the average person over make you dependant and put you on welfare so they
can run your life and that's the clip that we'll play when we come back start

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
I got a question folks will John King of CNN get fired for admitting the tax
overhaul cuts of Trump that we all just had a huge victory with is quote damn
good money the American people and actually is a real middle-class slash
poor people tax cut that is basically JFK ask classic Democrats before they
became total you know modern psychopath or classic northern Democrat not
southern Democrat we're gonna play that clip in a moment but first Derek bring
together this powerful video that has Trump introducing the fact that next up
is welfare reform getting folks off of the spoiled rotten brainwashing
Democrat plantation here it is I know people they work three jobs and they
live next to somebody doesn't work at all and the person who's not working at
all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing
better than the person that's working his and her ass off and it's not gonna
happen not gonna happen give me my food stamps do you really want to work or
you just you just want to get a free check there's a sign behind you this
waverly job center you have any intention of going in to get a job or
you're just gonna get the food stamps not looking for a job we call the
Department of Children and Families to see what they've been doing to help DCF
says Hillsboro kids incorporated has been helping by paying Adams rent even
providing her furniture Adam says it isn't enough somebody needs to pay I
honestly you don't want to work and I'm not going to can't force me I need my
food stamps I need them okay this is not a joke just give me my food stamps so
I'm asking for they are not incapacitated in any way or they you know they
don't have a mental or physical disability that's documented and or could
be observable more counties will join them as federal exemptions to the
requirements expire now that unemployment is below 10% for each affected
county I felt really bad about being on food stamps for a while they're just for
people who really really need it I thought and I'm like living this
flippant lifestyle in Francisco well yeah and eventually I just sort of
realized that even though I'm 24 like I still have responsibilities I still have
like hopes for my future and if I need to be on food stamps make that happen then
maybe I do really need it you feel guilty about using your food stamp card
when you have $850,000 in the bank no no I don't I'm going by the rules and if
they need to change the rules they can change the rules but I don't see I'm
doing anything wrong how much do you collect in benefits I give 780 and food
stamps $500 in tennis and I get Medicaid and WIC give me my food stamps
now for hundreds of years once Rome became an empire they controlled people
in the city which was the political control of the whole empire with free
handouts and they penalized people that basically produced who were in the
middle class got the ultra-rich patricians and you had all the poor
people down below that were citizens and then slaves but up beneath that but the
same things repeating by design and we have the lbj letters all of it when he's
president Sam we're gonna domesticate these people and have these n words
vote and Democrat the next hundred years and it is a program against
everybody they were particularly successful black folks because they'd
been down dropped before they had their own communities were somewhat
successful and there was an oh you're gonna help me actually here yeah get
father out of the home there's some money we're gonna do this and then it
creates just that same spoiled rotten behavior not gonna make me work
whatever but you're gonna go vote for policies that raise taxes in the middle
class where all these liberals go and vote for big tax increases but suddenly
the IRS claims they're behind on some technicality and then an old lady has
her house taken as she commits suicide we see these stories all the time see
they're taking people's businesses and houses because they're producing and
then they claim you didn't pay or they've fallen hard times they get behind or
there's all this IRS fraud against people it's been documented like the
old Hispanic lady there like a eight top little counter deal for 40 something
years and she always deposit the cash every day like 600 700 bucks at the
bank it was all registered but they said well we say that structuring and so
you're manipulating we're gonna take your was it 80 something thousand dollars
she'd saved for her retirement she was gonna pay for herself but see they took
it away and then they said oh it's legal we have a wall we can do it you've
paid your taxes but it's illegal to make under thousand dollar deposits every
day you're like but I do a cash business mainly but also some checks and
things I do this and this is how it is and we have credit cards as well we
don't care see that's how you do humanize that's how you enslave that's how
you control and then this lady it looks like she weighs 400 pounds which is fine
but she's getting money of food well you know while people starve in the third
world this is what she has to say here it is I honestly don't want to work and
I'm not going to can't force me I need my now now notice she's totally in time
like a lady that has 12 14 kids whatever it was and she goes look at all these
kids somebody's got to take care of them it's totally lost on her but this was
done to destroy her a better grandmother was a slickly dressed hard-working lady
didn't have a lot of money but had a lot of dignity and look like an executive
today and then she's a total rundown just out of her mind slob says somebody
take care of my kids and you don't think it's real to understand that's what it's
produced and now 47% of the population or more it's almost 50 is like this like
Mitt Romney said and the globalists know what they're doing it's a demographic
battle of total domesticated slaves that don't know how to do anything or take
care of themselves you see when it does it parks they say don't feed the law life
does it make some obese lazy and stupid well don't feed the humans because sure
if you break your backfall for roof get cancer take care of people that's what
welfare is for but not here you don't do anything ever again and there's a black
guy here is congressman mr. Scott and he's getting hundreds of billions of
investment in black areas and the black leaders are freaking out because they
don't want that they want to sit on top of people they control with a democratic
party and not see people empowered they're scared to death because if you
can free the black people you can free everybody the blacks are their target the
group they already had control of everything you see done to them is a
beta test for everybody else here's a clip of seeing is John King how long will
he be there how long will he have a job is he gonna get fired for telling the
truth he says it's a real gamble though will Americans want more money and run
their own lives will they want to go to a factory will they want to go work at a
job and get paid 30 bucks an hour or will they want to sit there and get $10
an hour sitting on their butt watching Jerry Springer here it is as you watch
this the Republicans are making a big bet they're taking a big risk I can't
will over time the American people say oh actually I like having more money in
my pocket oh they did hire more people at the factory down the street that's
their big bet not one Democrat has voted for a bill that cuts taxes by 1.5
trillion dollars to Abby's point you know if you're a working-class family a
lot of people say oh it's only $200 oh it's only $300 if you're a working-class
family living paycheck to paycheck two hundred three hundred dollars is damn
good money and you are grateful for it are the Democrats taking a risk especially
those from Trump states it's those ten there's ten Democrats up next year from
Trump states is this are they solid here or is this a bet that's the lowest level
of people that are at the poverty line and they should be got the Trump wanted
it gone but we're talking middle-class two thousand four thousand five thousand
dollars a year of the tax credits for kids now you're with that you're up to
eight ten thousand add all together somebody making sixty seventy thousand
dollars a year is now gonna be paying like five thousand six thousand dollars
instead of twenty thousand I mean it's I was looking at the numbers this is huge
and it isn't the tax cut that's so good it's that it creates jobs and then it
gets the ball rolling just like you've done we're not government finance we're
not corporate finance we don't have corporate sponsors we have you buying
good products that we want you to love some of the best out there water filters

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones I've even had media go how do you like it
now that the Liberals are calling themselves the resistances that confuse
people know we're the resistance we're taking back the planet and we're always
gonna be resisting evil in ourselves it's an ongoing battle it never ends it's
the great animating contest of liberty our perfection is our imperfection but
knowing God's perfection we can see into perfection and seeing perfection we
can know it and worship it and be part of it but through us God can experience
imperfection hence we were created expressions of God's mind but autonomous
individuals free not robots sentient conscious sharing the mind of God but in
a tiny microscopic way but still beautiful like the rays of the Sun
through crystal projected on the wall not the Sun but beautiful not the Sun but
part of the Sun and before the media says I'm son worshipping it's an allegory
to the mind of God now let's play a few minutes of Trump announcing the victory
that we should be celebrating greatly because prosperity to Democrats
Communists globalist dirtbags parasites Ernie Sanders scam artists like him
rich filthy five six houses you 100,000 dollar car never worked in his life big
flim flammer at the college big scam artists it's like high noon to count
Dracula so here it is in 34 years but actually really hasn't been done because
we broke every record it's the largest I always say the most massive but it's
the largest tax cut in the history of our country and reform but tax cut really
something special and I noticed this just came out two minutes ago they handed
it to me AT&T plans to increase US capital spending one billion dollars
and provide $1,000 special bonus to more than 200,000 US employees and that's
because the way dozens of companies have now announced some things that's pretty
good and whole leadership a whole list of accomplishments that the group behind
me have done in terms of this administration and this Congress but
you've heard it before records all over the place and that will continue and
then some because of what we did but three point two trillion dollars just
think of it in tax cuts for American families including doubling the standard
deduction and doubling the child tax credit the typical family of four
earning seventy five thousand dollars we'll see an income tax cut of more than
$2,000 they're gonna have $2,000 and that's in my opinion going to be less
than the average you're gonna have a lot more than that one thing very important
for the farmers the great farmers and the great small business owners that
were forced to sell their businesses at bargain basement numbers we have
provided for the most part estate taxes wiped out so they can keep their farms
in the family and that to me is a very big factor very big this is going to
mean companies are going to be coming back you know I campaigned on the fact
that we're not gonna lose our companies anymore they're gonna stay in our
country and they're gonna stay in our country and you've been seeing what's
been happening even at this prospect but they stop right there I'm gonna come
back with more the president after breaking up a guest joining us let's
back it up a little bit you know that's the thing my dad we have an old farm
slash ranch and they get more and more we get sold just to keep the little
piece pieces we've got and then the way they've got it set up you run cattle do
stuff just to pay the taxes and then everybody has to have a couple of the
jobs on the side and this is all been actuaried in by the big companies and
there's only one group only one group that has higher levels of suicide than
our veterans and that's US farmers we were so close to total shutdown and we
were still in deep trouble but we were fighting back we're conscious now we've
been stabbed quite a bit but our hearts still pumping we're gonna make it and
know we are we're gonna crush these people and they know it

worldwide it's Alex Jones
important for the farmers the great farmers and the great small business
owners that were forced to sell their businesses at bargain basement numbers we
have provided for the most part estate taxes wiped out so they can keep their
farms in the family and that to me is a very big factor very big
this is this is going to mean companies are going to be coming back you know I
campaigned on the fact that we're not gonna lose our companies anymore they're
gonna stay in our country and they're gonna stay in our country and you've
been seeing what's been happening even at this prospect but they have tremendous
enthusiasm right now in this country and we have companies pouring back into our
country and that means jobs and it means really the formation of new young
beautiful strong companies so that's going to be very very important the
pass-throughs you know all about and the small businesses are going to be big
beneficiaries we are going to bring at least four trillion dollars back into
this country money that was frozen overseas and in parts and worlds and
some of them don't even like us and they had the money well they're not going to
have the money long and so it's really I guess it's very simple when you think
you haven't heard this expression but we are making America great again you
haven't heard that I want to I want to have them get up and get the glamour
and the glory and I just want to have a few of them come up and they'll speak
for a little while short if they the shorter the better that way we can we
can get all of you we'll get everybody up right but I want to thank Mitch
McConnell I want to thank you what a job what a job and I want to thank Paul
they're gonna speak they're gonna say a few words but Paul Ryan and Mitch it was
a little team we just got together and we would work very hard didn't we huh it
seems like it was a lot of fun it's always a lot of fun when you win if you
work hard and lose that's not acceptable but I I'm just gonna name a few names and
then some of us we are back live just more of the big historic victory and I
cannot stress upon everybody enough I know you know this but your friends and
family may not the globalist admit in the WikiLeaks and many other documents
many other statements that they've made that they are openly trying to demoralize
the West demoralized free market demoralized renaissance and this tax
bill is far from perfect but it's the biggest in modern history it's as big
as Kennedy tax cuts that by the way double tax receipts in one year and you
ask well why don't Democrats want that they want control and they admit it so
this is a big victory the worm is turning in my view it'll be so hard for
the nasty Mueller and his whole fake thing to try to bring Trump down now
even with the Christmas indictment of Kushner that was supposedly gonna happen
a few days before we have that on good sources they may back off on that now
Mueller saying maybe a year out hoping you forget about the criminality of
their investigation now the EU's come out and said this is gonna flood jobs back
in the US you're supposed to match taxes with us under these secret agreements
I mean that's in the Associated Press that we're breaking global government
rules yeah that screwed us over I mean we might have got sucked into your rule
government it was some great deal then later you could have took over but you
made it a screw job from the beginning you want to tell us who runs the TPP and
all this oh Trump killed that too so I could be critical of Trump on quite a
few things but frankly I couldn't do what he's done and the global movement that
all of you are leading that Matt drudge is leading I mean I can't thank
everybody in the independent real press but now having talk show hosts you know
John King on CNN say this is a great deal for people this is really historic
1.5 trillion getting rid of the cutting way back the estate tax bringing back
the corporate money that this is a big deal and I couldn't think of a better
person in the aftermath of this victory the consummate libertarian talk show
host expert a businessman father a patriot Stefan Malinu needs no
introduction youtube forward slash free domain radio Twitter Stefan Malinu a
free domain radio calm you get is a book the art of the argument that's
excellent by the way so he joins us now to give us his look at this and how he
thinks they're gonna counter strike or maybe maybe he disagrees maybe this isn't
that huge of a victory Stefan Malinu thanks for coming on with us sir thanks
Alex great to be here Merry Christmas to you your family and your great
listenership I really appreciate the time to chat today back at you it is a
great victory it is a great victory because it does a whole number of things
number one it puts money back into the hands of the American worker which of
course is a great thing you get to keep more of your own money and some of that
is direct in terms of the tax cuts themselves but another is that by
lowering corporate tax rates corporations have more money to invest in
upgrades to to pay their workers more so it is a wonderful Christmas present for
the American worker that's a great thing the other great thing is it reveals the
Democrat Party to be basically a combination of the Grinch and a bond
villain I mean it's weird when you think about it oh no American workers are
getting more money around Christmas time that's the worst thing in the world and
it's like what terrible up you're a bad one they work with this 34 years since
we've had a real tax cut for the middle class and workers while we've been
deindustrialized which they admits a plan I mean why do you think the EU's so
dumb they're openly bitching saying you're gonna get the jobs now well of
course the EU doesn't want to have to restrain their own socialist spending so
of course they would love a deal where everyone keeps their corporate tax rates
high and keeps their tax rates high the EU is also being revealed this season as
well for sanctioning working on massive sanctions against Poland while paying
billions of euros to Turkey of all places Poland that the West fought to
try and free and failed in the Second World War who fought valiantly against
both Nazism and communism are being sanctioned while Turkey of all places
is being rewarded with billions of euros with billions and fines a hundred
thousand euros explain that to people per illegal that's come in military age
man the raping the killing going on the welfare they're giving them throwing
pensioners out of their sectionated housing putting them in I mean this is a
crazy plan well of course they hate the fact that Poland is a Christian nation
they hate the fact that Poland is a proud nation and they hate the fact that
Polish people having been subjugated and controlled for a significant portion of
their history either as Poland or the pre-Poland countries subjugated by
Islam subjugated by communism the fact that they fought so hard to be free that
they value and treasure their freedom and are willing to stand up against the
corrupt tyranny of the EU is something that simply cannot be allowed to stand
I mean Turkey is working nicely with the EU but Poland wishes to remain in
sovereign country and to resist mass immigration from the Third World and so
naturally of course they are fighting it tooth and nail and they also don't want
they don't want the example you know one prisoner walks through a fence that
everyone thinks is locked the other prisoners not getting ideas they can't
have one example of a country with borders they can't have one example of
a country with an in-group preference and they sure as hell can't have a
country where Christianity stands against foreign religions one I'm
concerned about though is the wild-eyed insanity Stefan Malinu where they've
gone from laughing at me yelling in the street to like trying to attack me now
they're getting more and more desperate and Rosie O'Donnell trying to make bribes
on on Twitter saying I'm serious a million dollars two million for senators
that vote against it and then and like saying go let's go kill congressmen I
mean they're getting they're going into complete insane asylum land and I'm not
scared of them like they're gonna beat us I'm just worried about their mental
illness I mean clearly what is wrong with them they are addicted to power and
they are representing an entire community in in America this is tens
possibly even a hundred million or more people who probably feel genuinely
having been dependent on the state for generations and I'm not just talking
about the poor we also talk about the military industrial complex and all the
people who benefit from the state's awesome power to create and redistribute
trillions of dollars in the economy that has created a market of people dependent
upon state power dependent upon the coercive nature of the state apparatus
and when someone like Donald Trump comes along and says we're gonna make the
state smaller we're gonna put more people in the free market we're gonna put
more people in the tax-paying private sector and out of the government
dependent public sector they panic and they freak out because they view the
government as the sole source of their survival they do not they no longer have
the self-esteem to believe that they can survive without welfare exactly we
gotta go to break Stefan Mullin who stayed right there cuz I'm gonna talk
about this because literally they're the ones that always been robbing us and
feeding on us and trying to dumb us down to be better servants in
domesticated and then we're finally struggling back cuz you know half our
wealth isn't enough for them and they think we're killing them because they
act like we're killing them meanwhile we're bringing all this wealth back I'm
gonna help them that's what created all the wealth idiots was a little bit of
free market we just get out of the way and let the adults give you freedom like
God you morons but sees they crave the power to control people it's worse than
just dependency water is the single most important thing your body needs so

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
Stefan Malinu is our guest drive the shotgun with us in the hour we have the
former board member of the Davos group of the head of the Aspen group you name
it Ted Malik joining us again he's finally ready to talk about Luciferian
ism and Satanism in the elite he himself has you know degrees not just in
economics the rest of it but also in theology and in the study of religions
and it's rampant in the globalist but again whether you believe the devil or
not it's an operating system a spirit an attitude like pirates are you know catch
their hair on fire and you'll have skull and crossbones saying if you don't give
up we'll kill you there's blood dripping out of the skull on the flag it means
we'll kill you anyways so it's it's kind of an idea of we're gonna hurt
everybody we're gonna steal from everybody we're gonna invert reality
we're gonna be corrupt anybody who isn't into that you finally run into people
that are like that you're just blown away that they get off on blowing systems
up controlling people dumb people down they get off on it and free market is a
system that allows you to make choices through the market and generally the
will of the people in a real market is the best system but you see BuzzFeed
editor saying I want total communism for Christmas okay so again living here in
a quasi-free system much better than North Korea they're making these
statements and Stefan also wanted to get into Christmas because in my view if
you're able to say two plus two equals four that's freedom quoting George
Arwell well if you can say Christmas it's freedom and it sounds silly but they
really want to erase everything whether it was perfect or bad or good or
indifferent because they want to force you to accept their new system so that's
why they they go after Christian culture particularly I don't mean the fake
churches and all the corrupt things that are involved with those but I mean the
actual idea of that and then they make fun of you know that and want to destroy
it so Stefan Malinu why you know just as a researcher looking at like an
anthropologist or sociologist why do they want to attack Christmas and why
are they going after it so much in this culture war and how are they doing in
the culture war and that feeds back into what we hit at the break what are they
gonna do as this all caves in most of them weren't even part of the power
structure but they were living through it feeling like they were running things
culturally and we're gonna excoriate and control and reeducate those of us
liberal conservative libertarian agnostic that didn't fit into their
little box I mean really they're a cult of bullies well there are those and this
is I think very appropriate to Christmas time Alex there are those in the world
who want to do good to be virtuous and that is individual action that is going
to help the poor that is going to bring food to people that's going to work in
soup kitchens it's going to speak to someone who's down and raise up their
spirits or if you want workers to to make more money then it's about starting
a business and hiring people and paying them well or if you want people to get
free health care then it's about donating to a hospital or church or
becoming a doctor and working pro bono from time to time so there's individual
action which gives you the satisfaction of having done good in the world but
there's people who just want to feel good without actually expending the time
energy and resources to do good themselves and those are the people who
want to change the system or the structure or the state or the law in
order to remove negative stimuli from them poor people sick people but they
don't actually want to go out and do good individually that's too much work
they want to get all of the benefits of doing good by advocating for a system
that's usually coercive in nature and thus as literally is said the road to
hell is paved with good intentions I could I've never heard it said better
that I mean that's it and so you pointed out the groups out there that just
think hey I'm gonna be thrown on the street and they don't know any better
and that's that's kind of the folks in the bottom of the room but in the last
decade or so more and more of that pyramidal structure actually thinks
they're part of the elite and have been taught kind of the upper crust anti
liberty anti-human authoritarianism and so they've the left in its modern sense
has I believe converted to a crazy form of authoritarianism do you agree with
that and if so why I think it's the devil's temptation right the devil
takes Jesus to a mountaintop in the desert and shows in the whole world
and says all of this can be yours if you follow me and this Darwinian thirst
for material power for material resources it's a merely about gene
reproduction for the most part we are we are driven to seek resources to ensure
the survival of our offspring and if you take away Christian ethics or
philosophical ethics or virtues that surmount and surpass and restrain the
mere Nietzschean Darwinian will for power it's a government for control of
resources society falls apart society is a common code of self-restraint and in
under Darwinism there is no self-restraint you get as many resources by
whatever means necessary as possible you have just crystallized it and the
globalist endorsed that they say we're social Darwinist explain what that means
to people well social Darwinism to some degree is I think allowing for the state
to favor particular groups what one of the things that's happened that's been
really really tragic is the growth of the single mom industry so to speak where
you have this breakdown in marriage you have easy divorces you have alimony you
have child support and you have the state stepping in for irresponsible women
who have children and then they lionized it they were not attacking single woman
but then they lionized it they set it up well it used to be the case of course
that if you were a single mom your parents would end up having to pay to
raise your child so your parents had a very strong incentive to restrain the
wild tsunami like hormones of teenage sexuality with the welfare state taking
away the negative consequences of irresponsible sexuality it's the old
Chesterton quote says when you get rid of the big laws you don't end up with no
laws you end up with an infinity of tiny laws and now we have all of this crazy
breakdown in sexual morality which is causing massive amounts of predation
and massive amounts of single motherhood and so this is the welfare state takes
resources from more responsible people and gives it to less responsible people
thus encouraging the reproduction of less responsible people personality is
largely genetic and therefore you have social engineering you have a kind of
dysgenics operating at a social level through the welfare state and it is
exactly the genesis claimed they were going to clean all that up but instead they made it 50 times worse yeah the government should not be
involved in providing resources for reproduction that is eugenics at a
fundamental level whether you have eugenics on a race or class-based level
is wrong to take resources from one group and give it to another group because
it's fundamentally messing with the DNA of the species usually to extraordinarily
terrible effect well we've seen that I don't know if you've seen the compilation
of videos we might play it again where people go I got 12 kids you somebody
better take care of them it's not enough to get $10,000 a month free housing and
free furniture and everything I'm gonna sit here on my butt squirting kids out
and you're gonna pay for it oh and it's terrible and children when children are
an expense society gets more responsible because responsible people have to pay
for those expenses and women choose the best provider in a free market the best
provider tends to be the smartest the most resourceful the most intelligent
the most wise the most mature and so you end up with a positive eugenics in the
free market where smarter people end up with more resources more free market is
the only humane true eugenics it is absolutely and when you end up with the
system where children become an asset rather than a liability then what happens
is people have children in order to make money and that means they don't have to
have anybody responsible sticking around and of course the whole welfare state
thing where they say you only get welfare if there's no man in the house
they are paying women to have children and keep fatherhood at bay to keep
fathers away they gotta go to break when come back I gotta ask you I mean they
admit they're doing about design just to have control but don't they see what it
ends up in it literally ends in idiocracy and in idiocracy isn't coming in

you're listening to the alex jones show
from the front lines of the information board it's alex jones ladies and gentlemen we
undoubtedly have the biggest specials of the year every Christmas and you also
when you get great products you find the operation so it's a win-win a no-brainer
I know you're busy I'm busy if you'll just commit to go look at the thousands
of items from high-quality shortwave radios to books to videos to survival
gear to hundreds of great patriot t-shirts to spread the word and meet
like-minded people to hundreds of greats high-quality vitamins mineral
supplements we really do go out and find out best research the best scientist and
and really bring you game changers and I didn't think this was coming until
January and I bet on dr. group's butt about this because it's got a much
proprietary products in it that are so hard to get that it's been sold out for
over six months and this would be the best seller we ever had if we could keep
it in but to have try to have it at California standards and all the rest of
it's impossible with these ingredients because you know kale has 20 times the
lead that that you know that this has but that's a food so California lets you
have it so we have to put stickers on this for California because it doesn't
pass that California standard prop 65 they put in 20 years ago you know where
that the buildings say this building's toxic even it's brand new and the cars
they sell there have big stickers this is toxic and it's just insane so this
has I think like a third as much lead in it as kale does but it's got herbs in it
that have naturally occurring lead in it so that we tried to even source it
where we could have it without it and have it pass California standards that by
the way you got a whole foods at 90% of it says does not pass California
standards because nobody can okay but again I just said forget it we're not
doing it we're putting the we're putting the sticker on it okay doesn't pass
stupid California baloney standards where the lawyers pass that law the air
has more lead in it okay I mean it's unbelievable the point is is that it's
amazing and it goes in we're not just put on a formula saying this knocks out
yeast and candida and then put anything out and then there was a problem we just
changed it this is the formula that works taking a six plus months to even get
it back in stock and people it has five star reviews it's insane and if you
think just probiotics are good to just place the bad bacteria because all the
pesticides in the food kill the good bacteria and then you take good
bacteria so that you can replace it that's a good thing to do we have
fluorolife and carnivore enzyme they're all excellent 50 billion live enzymes
you name it it's I mean 50 billion live live cultures it's all there but Myco
ZX is amazing and will annihilate the slime walls that yeast and fungus is
creating a gut to take over your entire biological system and feed itself you
have to knock that out and let me tell you most people to take this it is
insanely dramatic if you have a yeast or fungus problem in your gut if you
don't have a problem well then you're like 10% that just say okay it's got a

is you asked me to do this but I'm gonna do it by the way I want to carry the book
I don't think that's been done yet that is the art of the argument from Stefan
Malinus so before we get back into all this because it's important to fund all
our operations you're being censored you've been demonetized on YouTube 90%
so have we they're trying to block us everywhere so folks if they want to hear
more of this see the websites get better and see more content and see people
expand then support buy a book subscribe to a special broadcast whatever how do
folks do that stuff on well they can go to the art of the argument calm order
the book it's also available on audible calm narrated by yours truly and of
course free domain radio calm slash donate in this Christmas giving season
it's very very helpful to help fund the operations and the growth we just grew
about 20% year over year and it's been a great fantastic year we're well north
of half a billion views and downloads and people can help out the show Bitcoin
PayPal visa mastercard whatever at free domain radio calm slash donate and
let's be clear we're not victims so we'll tell you in full wars has grown
usually 30 40% a year we've tripled the last year
everybody knows we're under total attack and they have just cut off millions in
sponsorship destroyed things I mean they've had black ops disinfo teams then
we got it's it's it's I'm not whining it's actually quite entertaining and
enjoyable and makes my life exciting I'm seriously I'm not just saying that
that's kind of sad for my family but that's you know I trust in God but they
hate the fact that you're direct funding as they're trying to shut that off it's
so Stefan's like yeah you know we're growing 20% every year they've been
after him too so he's not gonna whine about it he's saying hey we're growing
despite the attacks we would have completely taken the culture back if
if if they weren't fighting back just know this a war is happening it's
critical to your own interest to know we're not funded by George Soros and
globalist we're funded by you so we are your fist and we are taking action
Stefan well let's sort of take a little bit of an example here just to talk
about the financial benefit to the listeners because you know cold hard
cash runs the world and numbers don't lie so your channel and my channel were
very very interested in Donald Trump and although he is a man with laws and we
paid I've paid for it with $70,000 a month now it's like 5,000 that's how
we paid well I've paid so I did a lot of shows reaching millions of people
about the lies that were being told about Donald Trump because for me it was a
two-fer it was help get people to the truth about Trump and his agenda and
also show just how much the mainstream media lies how do you know they're
lying they're broadcast how much did you pay for tell the truth well it was a
bit of a challenge let's put it that way at times but look I mean just look at
so Donald Trump got in and now the biggest tax cut in US history has just
been passed which puts lots of money back into the hands of our listeners so
if you've helped support at the show 20 bucks a month 50 bucks a month 5 bucks a
month whatever bought some stuff from your store bought my book help support
things I think it's kind of paid off just in terms of you may be getting
thousand explain we went from mandate we went from 70,000 a month when they
delisted us and went like 95% demonetized to again like seven to ten
thousand a month I mean I'm not whining I want people to know this is what
YouTube did to us and admittedly to punish us so I'm not saying hey look at
me I'm just telling listeners thank God you're there we'd be gone because
listeners filled in that gap you want to find the people who are being opposed
the most because the people who are being opposed the most are doing the most
you know if you're in a war and you're marching in the wrong direction you're
really not going to reach any opposition nobody's going to be fighting you in
fact the other the team the other army the enemy are very happy that you're
marching in the wrong direction it's when you march in the right direction I
guess Wonder Woman style that you run into the blistering fire so look at the
people who've got the most smoking craters around them and give them some
ammo gosh you just it's true and it's not that I'm even whining I want folks to
know like like I'm a heat-seeking missile that goes towards their fire like the
World War two analogy of they didn't have a radar or satellite then they went
towards the flag because they would shoot you know wherever the factories
were and it's the same thing we're we're steering into it we just want folks to
know exactly as you said whoever's being attacked the most is the key to
spread there is no substitute for and it's a great kind of radar because when
you look at the people who are being attacked the most and listen there are
people who are wrong and it depends how you're being attacked if you put it like
if I put out an argument that has some incorrect data or I've made a reasoning
error fantastic you know people will tell me that but instead it's racist you
have it they're not attacking us on what we did right and if they go after you at
this hysterical venomous puff adder viper strikes personal level yeah he's a
this he's a that and it just tries to bury you in negative adjectives that
means you're doing something right and so when people are being attacked libeled
slandered lied about and so on that's when you really want to pay them
attention because they're not fools the enemies are not fools they know who's
having the most impact and they also know when the person having the most
impact has good reason and evidence behind them because if you've got bad
reason and evidence you just say oh the data is contradict exactly we have their
number we know their program and we're winning that's why they hate us and they
have openly told they've openly told everyone through the solar linsky book
rules for radicals and a lot of other publications they've openly said we just
want power we just want control we don't have any values we don't have any
ethics we don't have any standards but we know our enemies do and we're dying to
use them against them yes all of us he said I worship Lucifer I pledge myself
Lucifer in the intro of his book and the New York Times of the day said we love
Saul linsky we're gonna defeat you he's our God Stefan Mullin who's got a bunch
of topics I'm not gonna bring up a topic I'm gonna see what he wants to cover next

you're listening to the Alex Jones show he aligns himself with the truth and
it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones alright
final statement with Stefan Malinem and I said I want to get the topics he wants
to cover we've already covered a couple but I gotta raise this because it's come
up several points face with libel suit dossier drafter Christopher steel who
got paid by the FBI to put it out hedges on linking Trump to Russia now in
court documents he says he can't I mean it has imploded okay and then the
crimes but that's a secondary thing the big one is I haven't mentioned yet
today is 19 people injured his car deliberately hits pedestrians in
Melbourne you know for every car attack one out of a hundred might be somebody
else but it's always Islamists the other times and I noticed that CNN didn't
say it was Islamists even though he pledged leads to ISIS they said he was
mentally ill mental health issues Muslim who ramped 18 people with car has no
link to terror because they say and now they're saying the guy that attacked
New York was mentally ill well of course they're mentally ill but they're being
directed by by a monotheistic death call that the left bizarrely is sided with
because this is our guest just a certain amount earlier it's this whole
solowansky a power what's crazy is you read the elite books of Karl Marx and
and and Vi Lenin and all these people they they say we love Lucifer but Lenin
was a devil worshipper it doesn't mean he's even believes in the devil he is
the devil you know it's kind of like a lot of the top Google people say I don't
believe in God yet I'm gonna be one Kurzweil so it's megalomania is what
it is and it's the same craziness so so I said hey whatever topic you want to
cover but I'm just throwing this out because the Europeans have come out a
new poll saying immigration terrorism's biggest issue what 40% said while
they're being oppressed and told if you report what color somebody is will arrest
you and then we're not joking this is this is like naked crazy authoritarian
ism I hope this is the last desperate gasp of the authoritarian left but you
know even though we're getting a few beach heads here I don't think we're out
of the woods yet stuff I'm on him it's horrible and tragic and I'm kind of torn
I tell you straight up Alex I'm really ambivalent about this I do want the
mainstream media to reform themselves and I kind of don't you know that old
saying never interrupt your enemy when he's in the process of making one giant
mistake after another the fact that they are so doubling down on avoiding basic
issues like demographics like IQ like belief systems like compatibility like
welfare usage like crime statistics the fact that they're so steadfastly
covering their eyes sticking their heads in the sand and screaming la la la la
like a half upside down ostrich is creating massive market opportunities
for us if they reform themselves and if they start telling basic truths about
the world people will start tuning into them rather than us so it's not like I
just want people to watch me if they really reformed themselves I'd be happy
to have fewer audiences because that would mean more truth would be getting
exactly I don't think this plague of crazies that's all I want but the left
is one more standard in the world yeah I just now the fact that they are
literally delusional I mean of course they're talking about mental illness
because leftism is a mental illness it is a steadfast denial of basic biological
empirical reality it is a denial of universal moral values like thou shalt
not steal thou shalt not kill thou shalt not thirst for demonic power over
thy fellow bipeds it is a denial of reality it is a denial of virtue it is
a denial of compassion and it arises from a childhood written empathetic grave
of maltreatment and so it is of course they say that these people are mentally
ill because they're mentally ill expanding on that Russia gate whether
topics I got hundreds but I want to hear what what's front and center on on
stuff I'm on his brain well I want to think about Christmas just a little bit
because you know we spent a lot of time fighting the forces of darkness and it
is important excuse me to love and remember to turn towards the light so if
you've had a year of combat I suggest you rest and enjoy your time of a
Christmas it's funny you say that because I never rest and I'm committed for next
year I apologize erupting it's just too I've committed actually taken off next
week sorry go ahead well so if you fought the good fight rest enjoy and get
ready for next year if you haven't then rest anyway and gear up to commit to
next year which is going to be one hell of a year to be fighting well that's my
next question for you that's why we're mind melded yes this was the most
insane year in my life everybody else says it was good the bad thing I believe
was incredible year of change what is 2018 well 2018 is the rack and rock of
freedom 2018 is the final battle I think because either there's going to be a
tipping point where people start to go towards the truth tellers and those who
have virtue compassion empathy and goodness in their heart or they're
going to slide down to the satanic pit of the surface and the liars we have to
upper game we who are out there in the public sphere telling the truth we have
to be more engaging more entertaining more enjoyable we have to use every
trick in the book to pull people towards the giant geyser light of freedom
that we pursue and represent we have to upper game and not just stare at the
demons in hatred but stare at the light and the virtues enjoy because there's
only a certain amount of opposition that's going to attract people we have
to show people what we love as well as what we hate like the old thing about
the soldier the soldier doesn't fight because he hates what's in front of him
he fights because he loves what he's protecting he loves what's behind him so
we have to remember to share the love of freedom the love of free of free markets
the love of free speech the love of gun ownership we have to remember to share
what we love in order to attract people to our course and not just simply as the
old saying that Nietzsche has said if you hunt monsters your own your whole
life you have to be very careful you do not turn into one total veritas you know
I woke up at 3 30 in the morning and I couldn't go back to sleep and I wrote
a bunch of notes and I forgot to bring him a course that was one of them was
that just celebrate and just turn loose and appreciate kind of a Zen moment all
that is good and magnify that and think about the good instead of hating the
evil so much that I tend to do and there's a place for that but I had that
and I'd never really experienced this much in my life but now that I had the
feeling of all there was like kind of like not turning loose but feeling the
source and like like resting back into it it I mean this really is metaphysical
hermetic we I mean we know all this and that's why that's why I know next year
is the battle of the gods you know as you just said the good or dumb are wrong
because of course things repeat themselves I'm saying the final battle
the gods but but a model of that because they're gonna throw everything and for
every action there's an opposite and equal reaction quantum mechanic shows and
as I feel my personal discernment energy increasing because the enemy is now
about to throw its full weight against us so don't think just because we feel
all this energy and strength right now that that's because we're totally want
to be arrogant that's because we're like Godzilla something big is about to
come out of the ocean the big fights about to happen well that's true and it
is going to be on social media it's going to be on YouTube it's going to be on
Facebook it's going to be on the Internet because the Internet was the
very great equation variable that they did not anticipate the Internet was
responsible for getting Donald Trump in power and keeping Hillary Clinton the
sorceress of iniquity out of power so they're very aware where the true power
resides they can read the numbers of subscriptions as well as we can they
know where the audience is going for being arrogant to panic that makes them
stronger now that they're not arrogant anymore but more dangerous right because
when people panic cornered animals get more random in their behaviors so yeah
you need to be alert but we do need you know we fight ugliness but we worship
beauty and we must remember to turn away from the ugliness to drink deep of the
cup of beauty to inspire people with the beauty of the world that we want to
create rather than simply showing people all the time how ugly is the enemies we
face because people will be drawn to that beauty and that beauty that love you
know we may fear the devil but we love God if that's where virtue lives in our
hearts and we must remember to bring people to church rather than to the
exorcism all the time you're right you that is literally the epiphany I had
earlier on it's a common truth like I discovered you're absolutely right but
I think that's spreading right now is that we need to celebrate our victories be
thankful and as you said we fight evil but we love beauty we fight evil to
protect beauty and if we allow our all of our actions to be dictated by evil
doers we simply are the shadow cast by immorality in the world and that is not
enough we really must we can we can show the darkness by being the light just as
much as going down to the dungeons you know if you brighten something up and
something's in the way of the light it costs a long and highly visible shadow
and if we blaze brightly in our joy of truth and beauty and virtue then we will
show the horrifying nature of those I agree more than if we go down and fight
them all the time how did Hercules defeat it when he had to go into the
dark or his final feet of a memory serves and I guess he had to like go
inwardly the light that was within him to defeat it it wasn't battling anymore
he couldn't beat the darkness by sure will he had to think about the light
that was in him that God had given him to defeat it Jesus was not a ninja Jesus
had no nunchucks Jesus was somebody who pursued and talked about virtue and the
light and sacrificed himself for it and in that sacrifice he created an epiphany
of beauty and virtue that people have been following for thousands of years
and that's not a bad model to be following and that's why they hated so
much right right they could not talk to their cowards they're fighting at their
level they could not taunt Jesus into fighting at their level he transcended
their level and provoked a following that was in many ways the true foundation
and beauty of Western civilization just like they attack Christ they attack
Uncle Tom because Uncle Tom wasn't a wimp he was strong he just let them kill
him and torture him to bring them down and the fools see that go look at this
idiot but he sacrificed himself yeah just when they think you've lost is the
time for your greatest victory and that I think is next year all right wow well
we'll be there together hopefully they haven't done the internet kill switch

you're listening to the alex jones show
if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones all right this short
little segment before our next guest joins us at former board member of the
Davis group head of the Aspen Institute highest levels of the globalist
operation he wants to get into Luciferianism Satanism the operating
system of the psychopaths we're facing Ted Malick joining us coming up in the
next segment but I wanted to get into senator Warner because again if their
whole Russia gates falling apart if the head of the PP gate dossier has now
come out in court and said well there isn't Russian collusion in it they're
getting sued for saying it so he goes oh no we didn't actually say it the dossier
there's no proof it's not real that's in the news today out of the Washington
Times but they haven't told their minions that yet so Warner comes out with
press conferences almost every day along with that shipless creature shift and
they get up there and they go don't you try to fire him you stop it I heard
you're gonna and Trump's like I'm not gonna fire him he's falling apart he's a
joke
it's an embarrassment to them the whole thing's a fraud it's blowing up with
their face but they just came out saying don't you fire him to act like it's got
all this gravity to act like he's scared of it that's their cover story and it's
so pathetic meanwhile kid Daniels just wrote a story that needs to go viral it's
on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and news wars.com because you know we're
winning but some of the public does it so it's neck and neck here sometimes not
quite neck and neck now we're gonna pull it away but let's not like the wolf says
in Pulp Fiction let's not start you know doing you know what to each other yet
because we're not there yet okay we're never there soon as you think you're
there you know it's all over. Trump re-election odds explode after first
year tax cuts that's I'll start the next segment with that juicy Ronald Reagan
famously said he said when I met Donald Trump it was like I was meeting the
president I knew he would end up being the president was Roger Stone seemed to
meet with him and then Reagan had folks called Stone and called Stone back and
said that's something about that guy that that that he needed to run him for
office by like Reagan never did that so there you go it's all destiny ladies
and gentlemen what matters about Trump is delivery the Judjitry Bites Fruits
Judjit Bites Fruits for the enemy attacks us they're not stupid they know I am that
they think I'm an insane maniac I tried to buy me off ten million dollars a year
is what the last number got to eat it over a decade ago well we're way surpassed
that it's not about me and ten million dollars but how much money do I have in
the bank if I have to fight them when they come after me which they're already
doing how much money do I have to build an operation and try to go after them to
go you want to kill me let's go all the way but here's Warner with his
incredible and it's all fake trying to go powerful and like to look distinguished
it's all a con game they're all failed actors basically here he is I rise
today concerned about the threats the special counsel's critical
investigation I'm not saying he is one of Russian interference in the 2016
disaster over the last several weeks a growing chorus sick of an irresponsible
and reckless voices have called for President Trump to shut down see
criticizing your fake investigation is shutting it down no it's not these
calls came from the fringes of our political discourse those who would
refuse and then we figured out we're kicking your ass we said don't do it
before base political instincts any attempt by this president to remove
special counsel Mueller from his position the Hillary minion or to pardon key
witnesses in any effort to shield them for from accountability or shut down the
investigation would be a gross abuse of power well buddy don't worry it ain't
gonna happen you dumbass trying to change the whole subject excuse me I
mean what a sack of parasitic crap that's the type of stuff the global is
put in this country to get in power to screw us over and guess what the tide
turns come like all those other senators aren't running for reelection and you
better start getting ready not to run for it because don't worry everything we
know about you's about to come out Warner get ready

50,000 unstoppable watts. Antrex!
Antrex! And radio!
It's not entertainment it's information warfare brought to you from deep in the heart of the ATX
and occupied blue state territory return in the Republic from deep behind
enemy lines I'm your guest I'm your host Alex Jones we have our guest Ted
Malin getting lined up right now via Skype from the UK with big news he's
former board member of the Davos Group former head of the Aspen Institute been
in the highest levels of globalism and he's gonna tell some big secrets today
about their mindset their view and the whole nine yards so get ready for that
in a moment but first Ivanka Ivanka Trump talking about just the child tax
credit one of the 30 little juicy gifts of our own money back to us to choose
how we want to spend our money and hence social engineer things according to
the people's will not a bunch of hunchback skexies in DC New York and
LA and Hollywood who again want to just cuckle everything because they're
demonic hunchback demons that though they should be throw to the furnaces of
hell immediately let's go ahead now and go to this this video your name actually
has been linked to this for a while because you were pushing an increase in
the child tax credit in the ultimate final bill it essentially is doubled and
I know you also had Mike Lee with you the senator from Utah and Marco Rubio as
well explain to the folks at home what it's gonna do for them well the
president was very clear that he really wanted to ensure that this bill
accomplished two goals of enabling American business is to grow and be
competitive and therefore lead to wage increase for for working Americans but
to also target relief and middle-income families and the child tax credit is an
incredible vehicle to do that we all know the cost of raising children has
gone up exponentially in this country as until recently wages have stagnated so
raising children is very expensive but it's the most important investment that
we as a country can make in the in in the future this is this is the next
generation of American workers American entrepreneurs and innovators so the child
tax credit was doubled the refund ability was expanded very importantly the
standard deduction the standard for the average family the standard deduction was
actually doubled which is enormously beneficial incredible child independent
tax care credit was maintained as part of the bill the adoption credit a lot of
good stuff in there what well when you look at the things that were cut the
things that were cut were the loopholes that benefited lobbyists and the
special yeah the things that we're gonna pay more taxes here actually were
things like the child tax credit that would have such meaningful impact for
for everyday Americans one of the things that was really so amazing to me in
traveling across the country is just the sense of financial fragility most
American families experience even middle-income American families the average
American family can't come up with $400 in the event of an emergency and my
father is committed to changing that this administration is committed to
changing that amen but see the globalist want a bankruptcy cloud and piven to be
able to reorganize everything that's the plan they admitted it's not like we're
just here seeing it no one that looks like that that's what they say and so
when you realize that it's just so cold-blooded what they're up to and how
close they got us to the edge of that precipice and how sweeter it makes this
reprieve but we better work harder and realize the globalist the leftist they
admit the New York Times that they are just energized Soros gave 18 billion he
usually spends about 500 million a year trying to bring down the US and now it's
18 billion but here's the deal you go see who he can muster on the streets he's
trying to beat a huge wave and historically you just can't do that
we're gonna go to Ted Mallink here in just a moment but I wanted to play this
clip because it's triggered the left to have congressman up there Tim Scott who
they say could end up being you know the next president down the road who cares
these black all I care about his brain he's a patriot he's shaking with
pleasure when he realizes how much true affirmative action under Trump's plans
already being dumped into inner-city areas real jobs high-paying these aren't
just fake make-work stuff turning to a social worker with no pay this is the
real deal and this has got them so incredibly panicked right now this has
them scared because they were so close to seizing control of America and using
as a pure engine of evil you think the Russians were bad when they went in and
took the czars out in 1917 and a moment of weakness and turn Russia into an
engine of evil it was bad can you imagine the United States as a pure
engine of evil this been a mixed bag last 50 years pure psychopath driven evil
by the globalist the Hollywood globalist type I mean good God good God we'd
have to go to the emergency backups then wouldn't it that they laid down because
they're already get they couldn't get our second they're going up the first
right now so here's the congressman Tim Scott who's got them all trigger call
them an uncle Tom all these names blah blah blah because the left's been good
at making black folks not think they could be part of the tea party or part
of the public party while the public party said we want to run you for office
you got a good background good person I will wake up the chief of staff saying
we want you in here if you're a minority with the White House wants to hire you
come on let's go come on come on come on let's go the Democrats aren't playing
strangleholds in come on up come on up let's go let's go because they want you
literally on their plantation let's go this club
Mr. President during one of those conversations that we had we talked
about ways to improve distressed communities throughout this country 52
million Americans living in distressed communities and we talked about legislation
that can move those communities forward got please Trump is you said yes as a
part of this tax reform package the investing and opportunity act has been
included which will bring trillions of dollars into poor communities because of
your willingness to listen the president said I only have about 45 more minutes
I'm gonna get to my he didn't say that okay let me just say to those Americans
who are watching this process this is not about Washington it's not about the
left it's not about the right it's about single parent moms who are looking for
reason to be hopeful in 2018 this tax reform plan delivers for the average
single mother a 70% tax cut for the average family who's working paycheck to
paycheck looking for ways to be hopeful about their future to have an extra
night for dinner out at a restaurant this tax reform package cuts their taxes
by nearly 60% and because of folks like Marco Rubio and Ivanka when you think
about the folks with kids in the household this plan doubles the child tax
credit and makes about 70% of it refundable this is a plan that we can
be proud of because it speaks to the hearts of everyday Americans but it's
not the poor workers shouldn't be paying any taxes Trump try to get rid of it
okay they shouldn't be paying anything because their taxes are already slow but
they need it all back it's the middle class tax cuts they're gonna surge 7.3
to 10.1 they're saying the most analyst I mean this is explosive growth real
growth not fake come to Chinese growth we're all goes to you know a couple
hundred generals we're gonna talk about all this on the other side but this is
just massive and I just think about the fact that Trump that very same podium at
the Capitol just 11 months ago committed to do so much TPP killing and all of it
he did it so that's there again so the president the Capitol is at the White
House then but I mean it's just right there in that very same area committing
to do it I was just right down below when he did it and I knew it I knew it my
gut my instinct said this is real it's happening and it's happened it's not
perfect it's a bloody war but it's in the right direction it's got the globalist

you're listening to the alex jones show
crucified for no sense if you are receiving this transmission you are
the resistance you're listening to alex jones
all right Ted Malick is with us for the balance the transmission and then we've
got the fourth hour coming up that I'm gonna be segling into with anti-cumia
always does an incredible job in the war with Owen shroyer Roger Stone coming up
Ted Malick was former board member of the Debo's group of course former head of
the Aspen Institute with the top levels organizations but he's always been a
patriot I've gone back to writings he did 25 years ago I'm looking into all his
PhDs international political economy and then he's also got degrees you know
dealing with religion but that's why it's important to get him on he's worked
in capital markets with Solomon brothers and service senior policy positions the
US Senate committee on farm relations the US State Department I'm gonna get into
all that the reason I got him on last time I wanted to get into the occult
obsessions of some of the globalists he wasn't ready he said yeah it goes on but
he said let me just think about what I'm willing to get into and then I'll talk
about it because I've been involved some with Hollywood and some with stuff in
the UK and they're like won't you come to Hellfire Club it's like major
directors people we're gonna go on these catacombs and it's like eyes wide shut
and once you do it you're in the club I'm like no so I never did at all and I'm
sure Ted hasn't either the point is not that I'm scared of it I just like going
crazy I'm scared of like people just being involved in all that so because
then it leads to other things you know like killing somebody at the end of the
night or whatever so Ted Malick's here to to break it all down but he wanted to
get into his prolific articles that are published all over the place from you
name it world that daily to info orders to big establish for publications but
US tax reform breaks global rules says EU that's how to DW.com big German news
now they admit it's gonna move jobs back to US they we have secret combines with
you we have agreements you're not supposed to do it
Germany demands UK's unconditional surrender on Brexit that that that's
Ted Malick Trump's top EU pick warrants German media of seismic shift in ties
shows world in daily article let's revisit the Podesta pigeon for pedophilic
cannibalistic and satanic art which we can say okay not the pizza place that's
how they divert us off into that but but but but but you know them themselves in
the WikiLeaks which we're ready to really release some big stuff on very
soon there's lots of that behind the scenes so Ted Malick joins us now when
I give him the floor we don't do pre-interviews and I haven't talked to
him since you visit us in studio a few weeks ago in Austin where do you want
to start with that palette that you kind of laid out a few few little pieces of
blobs of pain I put there where do you want to go first I think there are some
we have some time so we have some linkages the EU is part of of course the
globalist empire the new world order and I think that many of its origins are
in fact quite evil and I think we we should talk about that I've written
about it in his leg wars where I describe the under unconditional surrender
the Germany is demanding of Britain of the UK during the Brexit negotiations is
basically a German takeover of Europe making Europe into its own puppet state
with its crony capitalism and its fake currency the euro but I what I really
want to do after our conversation just a few weeks ago in studio is come back to
this question that you asked me that I was unprepared for because you know
some times it's uncomfortable particularly this time of year but I want
to talk about it and that is Luciferianism Luciferianism is a belief
system that venerates the essential characteristics that are fixed to Lucifer
that tradition has been informed by Gnosticism my Satanism and it usually
refers to Lucifer not as the devil per se but as some kind of liberator some kind
of guardian some kind of guiding spirit in fact is the true God as opposed to
Jehovah and I think many people in Europe and this state is Luciferian
orientation is really this creation of a fallen angel of course we know who Lucifer
is and he's seen as one of the morning stars as a symbol of enlightenment as a
kind of independence and of true human progress turning away from God and
turning to Lucifer in order to enlighten yourself so I did a little research on
this and you'll find this very interesting in his very famous 1971 book
which was his final book rules for radicals the very prominent American
community organizer on the far left Saul Alinsky wrote at the end of his
acknowledgments to that book and I want to quote this less we forget at least
and over the shoulder acknowledgement at the very first radical from our
legends mythology and history and who knows where mythology leaves off and
history begins or which is which the first radical known to man who rebelled
against the establishment and did it so effectively that he is one his own
kingdom was Lucifer Saul Inski dedicating rules to radical to his
hero Lucifer and of course that's him in public just saying oh I do this kind of
in a you know a little cheat you wear whatever but when you get down to brass
tax these people really believe they're setting themselves up as God and they
advertise just like you're in the French Revolution the false revolution the
Jacobin system versus our real revolution that they want to become God
they want absolute power and he writes about the book he believes in nothing
but absolute power this is so creepy this is the opposite of chivalry the
opposite of Christ the opposite of Jehovah that's what it is we're talking
about the anti-Christ we're talking about the fallen angel but for these
people turning their you know their face against the true God they're turning
to this form of anti-Christ of Lucifer and that's the foundation for their
guidance for their enlightenment for their institutions I would argue even
for the whole definition of this new world order and we can get into John
Podesta and his emails which we will do that next is we want to break but but
truly whether you're an atheist or not they believe in the archetypes and
operating system like a program you look at what they did to Russia I mean they
tried this whole Luciferian operation there they are so angry I talked to
folks high level in Hollywood other is they're mad that Russia is truly
becoming Christian they it's literally spiritual they are so angry well they
have to obviously feel very annoyed by any people any person any community any
nation that turns their hearts back to God and there's increasing evidence that
lots of people in Russia are doing that obviously since that was impossible
during the 70 years of Hania's communism so they are falling back on these
traditions their old religion the Eastern Orthodoxy in Russia but if you look at
the pure statistics Alex around the world about 85% of people believe in God
in different spiritual traditions in different sacred texts Christian ideas
obviously the largest of those Islam Hinduism Buddhism etc. they're all
very strong faith traditions Luciferians detest this and they particularly
detest the Christian tradition because Lucifer is the fallen angel away from
Christ that's right they they said they want to play all religions off against
each other till nothing's left but Lucifer we're gonna come back again I
know you're gonna get into this as a theologian you have a degree in but I
want to get into specifically I know you don't get into private stuff that
happened behind closed doors just as I as a journalist something's in confidence
I can't talk about it but in general the the spirit of Lucifer the attitude the
psychopathic culture

you're listening to the alex jones show
defending the republic from enemies born and domestic it's alex jones
humanity faces incredible challenges but only being aware of it can save us a
globalist ahead of one of the he wasn't the head of the big three he was the
head of the fourth largest bank in the u.s. the time again I flew to be on the
view years ago it's like six seven years ago now and I sat down next kind of
recognizing a little bit from watching financial shows he wasn't a gas but you'd
seen him he figured out how I was real quick as folks were shaking my hand and
he was telling his visit his dad who was a retired general in San Antonio and he
just had about a three hour conversation by the way got the perfect
suit after being on the plane and got his you know french coat out hair
perfect everything and is there all about that and he goes as the plane's
landing he goes alex you think people are gonna adapt and overcome the Marine
Corps term improvise overcome that overcome you'll you don't get it
that's what you're gonna do the general public is gonna adapt to being in the
system and he laughed at me and I said to him once he did his thing in turn
getting his jacket out he waited to say it after he listened to me for like an
hour on the plane we didn't talk the first few hours first he's like looking
over at me I'm sitting right next to American Airlines and he wanted to have
his piece of me done and I said listen I can't bet against humanity and want to
live and his back was turning he shuttered and it was that point like
I'm not giving my soul up I get the public's thumb down I get they'll tear
me apart I get I get it you've made him into a weapon the point is I can't feel
big while they're little I don't want to join you and look down on the slaves
don't you get it doesn't mean if somebody tries to destroy me I won't rip
their head off the difference is I'm not out to get people it's not like I'm
some saint you people virtue signal all day because you have no virtue and
studies show that the average liberal is always flip the numbers it's in a bunch
of British and US studies in Canadian but on average it's what six times more
unlikely to lie nine times more likely to steal or is it vice versa because
they're not real liberals and they've changed all the terms so Ted Mallick
you've got the floor of the segment I'm running Ted mallick.com got your new
book out secrets of business we really tell folks what's going on again former
board member of the Davos group so much more you know major envoy of the Senate
government of the Senate Committee for relations the US State Department big
insider but that's been a patriot on a bad guy not everybody in the insides bad
point is you've got a track where you're exposing it you're getting into
Luciferianism you're getting into their worldview you're getting into who they
are where are we historically what is this obsession with Lucifer what are we
facing the DNC Hillary Clinton campaign John Podesta of course was the top of all
the top of everything they were trying to do everything they were trying to
foment on the rest of us very involved in international organizations all kinds
of deals the Clinton Foundation if you look at his emails now the public and
for the first time actually look at these emails thanks to WikiLeaks and you
can see the references that he made over and over again to Luciferianism and
this is abhorrent also to sexual abuse abuse of children by himself he uses
code words such as cheese which means little girl pasta which means little
boy math which means steam and sauce which means orgy and he uses them over
and over again these code words on the deep web pedophile messaging boards and
emails and there are many of them your viewers can go look at them they're
available online they prove that he is involved very deeply involved as a
committed Luciferian and it's in among other things it's his invitation by
Marina Abramovitz to what is called a spirit cooking ritual which I think
proves the most revealing now for the year that was invented by Alistair
Crowley reportedly the most evil man alive reportedly sacrificed his own
son precisely this is a ritual a specific ritual in which participants use
the violist human body fluids in order to summon spiritual energies or
assistance in favor and to any same person this sounds completely lucrative
you know ludicrous but to Luciferian this is the practice of enlightenment it's
something that initiates them it's something that they understand that they
have to lower their humanity to a low enough level to be possessed by this
evil force that's the whole idea to be possessed by Lucifer himself and these
practices of a Luciferian religion and anti-Christianity are I would argue the
absolute inversion of Christianity as he says in the emails come we have blood
we have semen and this is what they use pizza gate to divert off to some pizza
store that the media all covered we covered it then they claim we were part
of it again this is what they're pouring out this is
unbelievable you know holy Eucharist the mass we also have cannibalism and
pedophilia these are highlights these are common practices actually amongst
Luciferians and this makes I think Podesta's choice of paintings in his
own office all the more revealing the paintings in his office and we actually
have photos of those as well are very disturbing they to pick cannibalism and
when asked in an interview by the you know the political magazine Politico
about the paintings Podesta replied that it's better to be the guy with the fork
rather than the guy on the table this is the guy that was leading the Democratic
Party this is the shot of what looks like eight-year-old girls begging not to
be gang-raped in a shower with I guess like step the time up the ceiling this
is and this is they would tweet photos of dungeons and then things and then they
and then again I didn't realize what was happening at the time when Washington
Post New York Times CNN all focus on a pizza place instead of the emails in
New York we covered the pizza place covered the rumors then they said we
created it and there's and then I had a crazy woman and a bunch of Democrats
attacked me literally at a restaurant to the night screaming do you screw your
baby we're going to get you screw your baby and the whole family was just like
I've got video of it I haven't put it out yet yeah this is Podesta's art chained
up little children I know and they're and they're so foolish they think that
they think that they I mean behind the scenes it's just unbelievable I can't
believe you're I just can't handle it I usually came and look at this stuff we're
putting on screen this is Tony Podesta's art that though notice it's lesser
magic though mr. Mallink they put this in 2007 in the paper as a public
celebration of what they were doing to throw it in our face and to dehumanize
us which is a form of mind rape so I mean what kind of people are we dealing
with what kind of leaders are we dealing with if these are their deepest
spiritual sentiments and practices chained up children kind of respect any
kind of a court let alone think of them for public office I mean it's beyond the
test of it is actually radical evil please continue well I actually think
that we have to expose this Alex where it exists to the degree it exists the
fact that it is at the top of our government that is in fact this is the
top of our national organization that has ran by the U.R. that is the U.R. in the
European Union stay right there stay right there I don't want to do
conspiracies but you've been on Skype many times no problem it is hammered and
and maybe you should we should call you on the phone we'll have video but you
were the phone and we're going to go to the next hour to finish this because I
want you to repeat all this is too critical and the media will play clips
and you know make fun of the sound and say you know whatever but that's why
they've got front-page articles in daily beast Buzzfeed all of them with me and
UFOs I don't even cover UFOs is trying to desperately inoculate people that
were cooks when all we're showing you is Podesta's public art that is children
chained up in dungeons and again his brother is an emails and they say sir
we will have the children for you tonight ages seven you know nine eleven in
the hot tub they're ready to service you but that you know that these are they
really good they said yes we will have the children for you in the hot tub I
mean they're sending this over email man God Almighty

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive consciousness free

still part of God an extension like God's hand stretched out across space
time a finger like that Sistine Chapel painting Ed Malik globalist insider not
a globalist is our guest he's gonna recap his critical information but first
let's hear Donald Trump pledging what he is now one year in already delivered
here it is we're gonna win so much we're gonna win at every level we're gonna
win economically we're gonna win with the economy we're gonna win with
military we're gonna win with health care and for our veterans we're gonna
win with every single facet we're gonna win so much you may even get tired of
winning and you'll say please please it's too much winning we can't take it
anymore mr. president it's too much and I'll say no it isn't we have to keep
winning we have to win more we're gonna win more we're gonna win so much I love
you Albany get out and vote how could he say that because of the boats tied to
the dock and he just needs to take the rope off they've already parlayed our
power to build up the world but not for the people for the globalist then he
already knows all he's got to do is untie it he knows we get this done it
works because we already know the economics Ted Malik take over my
friend for the nine minutes we've got in this segment we'll hold over the next
hour I know you had some Skype problems never happened before but it's happening
as you break as a big insider you're not talking about what you saw inside not
breaking any confidences you're only exposing what is in public domain recap
everything you said my friend you have a lot of courage go ahead well we were
talking about Luciferianism about its origin and offices in you know and
antique history what it amounts to anti-Christian orientation but more
specifically for the last few minutes we've been talking about the head of the
Democrat Party the head of the Clinton campaign a number of people in that
organization who worship Lucifer and what that means in their emails
officially in their emails officially world.com article please continue we
can't make this stuff up I mean it's just too grotesque but we also can look at
the paintings that they have in their offices the pedophilia that they practice
the spirit cooking that they become involved in and a whole nature of their
enlightenment and what that means and I we actually also pointed out that it's
all in ski and his original book for radicals pointed to the same tradition
to Lucifer so this is part of the left it's part of a turning away from our
which historically left meant left-hand path and the French Revolution the
occult it never meant left there wasn't left or right until then please
continue that that is an actual you're correct
so logically but what I really want to talk about because this is dark and
it's evil and it upsets me and my wife no end even let's just say you're taking
up this is a big deal to have somebody like you that's been in these circles
at the highest levels but this is a big deal a lot of courage I know you're not
going to say it yourself but this is a big deal so go ahead well I also taught
at Yale Divinity School as well as Yale School of Management I've been in major
universities I'm I am not making this stuff up I have the academic credentials
I understand its depth but I also realize we're talking here about something
that is radically evil it is anti-Christian so what what we have to
do is expose it for what it is and we have to point it out and I think that
the public will rebuke it well just continue breaking this down well I
think that what I'd like to do instead is talk about our own tradition because
after all it is Christmas exactly we know that's what that's the theme without
us even saying it we know the evil let's celebrate the light right now and the
beauty that truly despairs that that truly drives off the dark you know we
gave five minutes or ten minutes to this very radical and dark light let's
let's put the bright light on our own tradition the real root of our being in
Christian thinking which is rooted in the New Testament of course and the
wonderful insights of Saint Paul they actually have great relevance to us as
people not least of all because it's an attempt to spell out in very detailed
terms exactly what it means to live in the belief that the world is ordered
that it's ordered by a loving God that he demands love from each one of us not
only towards himself but also towards our neighbors and at Christmas and I'm
reflecting on this my family's coming home tomorrow flying in from all over the
world we especially need to reflect on what gift has meant in the Christian
tradition the tradition again that has shaped our Western culture that we cannot
give up we have to pray for those countries like Poland and Hungary where
they're actually battling the European Union over this very culture right now
and this whole concept of charity as love to which we are commanded to use the
original term so this giving which is of course part of the Christmas tradition
we all have these gifts under our tree we've all purchased these items we're
all excited about the pleasure it's a way of opening yourself up to the other
it's an invitation to friendship it's very exciting it's also very much a
part of the American tradition if you think about it Americans are really
defined I would say in many ways by their generosity by their volunteering I
mean when Toto came to America you know 180 years ago what he found across the
entire American hinterland was this feature and we should be rightly
proud of it this notion of generosity in America and in Europe you don't see this
very much because the state has taken charge and they carry out all the family
functions they carry out the charity they carry out all these sacred things but
then corrupt them and again they made it all commercial it could become sick
there but that's just it was back when people didn't have a lot to give
something was a big deal because that spirit made all this wealth now we
think of nothing giving all this again they've distorted everything that's
sacred indeed and so you have on the hold and in socialism and Europe is
socialistic to large extent you have this hostility to private giving this
hostility to the notion of gift because they want to get in the middle of
private association men and women community they want to get the middle of
our private associations that is a cult it shows no respect for private
property for industry for wealth and it tries to put this this notion of
equality in the state being the Arbitur over and all of this it's not
surprising to me when you think of the first act of Lenin after the Bolshevik
Revolution in Russia was to abolish and expropriate all private charities all
gift giving what happened in the Second World War when the Communist took
power in Hungary they had 10,000 religious voluntary societies in that
little tiny country of 8 million people within two years all of them were
abolished they stole the goodwill of the people they stole the goodwill of
people and this is true in Communist Party wherever you find it in China
today people have to give in secret or they have to give at risk of
imprisonment they have their underground schools or underground
universities their underground churches underground medicine and it's the
heroic actions and of the few that that lead to that kind of wonderful shared
experience of the gift and now here's my argument I'm saying that giving is not
only natural but it's a fundamental part of moral health and by giving which is
what we're doing in this season the existence of the other is fulfilled in
love and this kind of gratitude is absolutely is absolutely crucial to
being a human being if you read the Bible and some people do I hopefully in
church over the next few days the first letter to the Corinthians of St. Paul
delivers his celebrated aconium of the three theological virtues faith hope and
charity and that word for charity agape that is so critical a love that has
been brought to this world by Christ and which is the love which God extends to
all of us and which you are asked to extend to one another this is gift love
is what Paul talks about it is one it's an overwhelming spirit that's why I
get tears of eyes talking about this because it's so strong it's so pure
it's destiny for the species you can feel destiny knocking on the door at St.
Thomas Aquinas in you know in Christian history argues that it's the
fundamental gift it's granted by God to himself by his own nature and to the
world in choice so it's my life your gifts are a gift stay there we're gonna
come back so to 70 seconds stay there two minutes now the breakthrough that
said everything else is satanic it wants to hold God is giving giving giving
giving consciousness everything all the beauty everything and we're just like
bitching and complaining we've been given consciousness on this star base in
the middle of the galaxy with unlimited potential I mean we just it's thank God

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
lines of the info war you know Kate Steinling got shot in the back couple
years ago in San Francisco said well he's an illegal alien we got to let him
go you know he made it he did it well now they won't let her in San Francisco put
up signs of her face saying she had dreams too that video is coming up in the
next segment Ted Malick again we appreciate you joining us your new
books out about the secrets of business folks can find that we sell it info
war store.com Ted Malick.com we got five minutes left you got to go what are
other big things you want to impart what do you make of the big tax victory
yesterday what do you think this is going next how are they gonna strike back
because their rush investigations falling apart been proven inside jobs
spectacularly it shows how arrogant they are that was so shoddy how they paid
for it they admit it's fake I mean they should all go to jail this is crazy well
we'll have our special counsel in a year and hopefully we can pick up all those
loose ends and bring them to justice I was in tears yesterday when I saw the
Republican Congress on the steps there with the president and I mean it's just
an incredible accomplishment it's it's taken you know three decades to bring
this about it was four years but the leader of this whole exercise is a
person that took center stage he shared the stage with many of its authors of
course but without Donald Trump this wouldn't have happened so he also you
know remind your listeners said in the White House and again yesterday it was
that we have probably a decade from the White House you heard them from his own
lips Merry Christmas and again it seems like they make fun of it but they're
trying to ban it everywhere that's what an incredible cult of control freaks
these people are oh they've had this war against Christmas on for you know more
than two decades and Christmas has become an enormous you know commercial
occasion now so we divorced it pretty much from its religious original
original you know context so I mean where I want to go in this last few
minutes is basically just to remind the listeners that you know my life their
lives are a gift and so to our the goods that come to me and you and the gifts
that we're going to have under our tree in the next few days they come from the
source that granted life and once we see the world in that way which frankly is
the way of faith then we see the reality of just love and how the world is
ordered and we see its power we see the chain of gift and gratitude spread to
all things and it leads to our own spiritual well-being and we can join to
them and these are not burdensome chains on the contrary I think their
ingredients their main ingredient is actually freedom and by linking to these
chains we receive a benefit far greater than the one exactly I mean you have a
child to take care of them and they take care of you everything is symbiotic in
God's plan you see the incredible it's like all these atheists math mathematicians
genetic engineers they finally they become masters they go God there's a
God it all works so perfectly and it couldn't just come together by itself
and this is the story of Christmas God gave his only beloved son so that we
could have eternal life and that is of course the greatest gift of all time
it's it's his story it's the great drama of human existence so when we
celebrate the advent this year you should remember that nativity scene we
need to think about that form of gift love of God's grace which is bestowed on
every one of us on his creation in the first instance but to every single one
of us as human beings and then we can have a very blessed Christmas because we
can celebrate the Christ mass I'd explain to somebody the other day that
Christmas actually means if you can believe this Christ mass it does it
means them the mass of Christ's birth and death and risen that's it Christ was
born in Christmas he had his ministry on earth for a short period of time he
died and ascended into heaven and he takes us there as our final place so you
have to have the whole sweep of that humanity makes it we're going to the
heavens Ted Malick incredible it's all allegory it's all there it's all a
transmission for us to survive if we take it thank you so much we'll be back
Mike in Arizona here on the air worldwide go ahead oh Alex you can read any day of
the week thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your

computers and merge with them we will be destroyed forever if we awaken to that
program and move forward in our good people we will go to heaven to the

clear sense what we're dealing with the heavens lie before us extended life

Anthony Kumi and host this hour with his compound media dot-com doing a great
job but I wanted to hit this piece that's on info wars calm and news wars
calm left his students ripped down races Kate Stanley moral boasters you know I
literally got heart palpitations well I've never had those before last couple
weeks ago when Owen shroyer went downtown and men with guns not guns
operating their free speech or their second amendment but men with guns said
you're not going to the capital rally and then blocked him and attacked him
with clubs and you know he's like a Patriots I made a big goal they hit
with clubs would let me in on big deal how you guys are idiots but he was
assaulted and they the Antifa wouldn't let him get in for a Kate Stanley
Memorial for this poor beautiful young woman that lover was just black Hispanic
whatever shot in the back with her father she had dreams too and you've got
this guy who's been deported five times it's like the railway killer he was
deported I forget like 15 times I think he killed like 40-something people all
of them were Hispanic by the way it's not that Hispanics are serial killers or
have a hired the innocence of crime it's that they can go to any cutter they
want and governments just let them in because this global operation to open
up the Americas so this literal lunatic shoots her in the back and then the
jury won't even convict him of manslaughter which would just mean he
didn't know he killed her but still you're liable seven years in jail
California it's like that in most states served like three years maybe two
if you're good behavior maybe one in federal you serve 90% states serve like
a third a half there's video at the college where somebody put up I had
dreams too and again she's a white lady I think she has some Hispanics in her
family it doesn't matter Hispanics are mix of white folks and natives and the
Spanish bloods of some North African doesn't matter we're all humans beautiful
the Spanish women all of them are beautiful everybody's beautiful I love everybody the
point is is that she gets killed out with her daddy eating a snow cone and the
left can't even send the jerk blacked out of a mentally ill put him a mental
institution they won't do anything and they say 19 people run over one of them
they say is basically dead brain dead and they wouldn't say it's a Muslim they
go well it's ISIS but it's mentally ill yeah the Nazis were mentally ill
humans go into these weird things you and you can say other cultures were
mentally ill so they they the killer and then we got video at the university
where they won't even let them put up signs they could put up every other
sign they want kill the cops you name it that's in the article but you can't put
up a sign just saying she had dreams to left the students ripped down racist
cake Stanley Memorial posters to see if they're scared of a martyr and my own
reporters at Austin can't go to a rally for her that was by the way black
Hispanic everybody you name it there's nobody let me tell you something you
try to go to a patriot meeting if you're some white supremacists will kick your
ass and you have your free speech I'm just I'm not doing this because I hate
black people or anybody else I'm doing this because I want justice and the left
is so evil as like a union is like a system that they they will they will
defend anything as long as they're white which again is using race culture
which is very primitive very bad we're fighting Nazism which means we're
fighting this the Nazis were a race culture it works we're primitive we'll
do it well they got the whites in I'm not just being not defending leftist to
say this but it's mainly white people that are engaging in race baiting two
minority groups trying to get them to be racist and they got some blacks to do
it and I guess a small minority Hispanics but I don't want to bash white
people but it's mainly white people you name it Jewish German whatever
background to push this and you read the Southern Probably Law Center ADL put
out is the most classic racist crap you've ever seen and so now this dead
woman people can't have a rally in Austin forum you can have hand up signs
in San Francisco conservative students continue mourning the death of Kate
Stanley the woman murdered by a legal alien given sanctuary and remember most
these victims were spanning I'm not just saying that to virtue signal that's
just being heard people say oh thank you for caring about a Hispanic person or
black I care about everybody folks just I got feelings in San Francisco a left
of students continues to be triggered by her memory and they again pull down the
the the posters saying it's racist so here they are anti-free speech here's
the video
oh you guys got a problem with the posters you guys got a problem with the
posters yes and what would that be the problem by things you have to put a
quite a racist view point oh James Ovasis now huh this is her white
woman you know I'm not gonna have this conversation with you you're gonna have
that kind of tone so oh my tone I don't want to have a conversation in the first
place you'd rather care done posters these are women that the state is their
man
so they they take down her picture and notice the jury had most mainly a white
jury they had to say we will not put a Hispanic man in jail because she's white
if he'd been Hispanic he'd have gone to prison because they can't ever say their
policies are wrong and they have to take her picture now so she had dreams too
and she's dead she's in a coffin she's a skeleton now and you know I you're not
gonna hear one activist you're not gonna hear those liberal white women that
want to just act like they're on this big job and they live in this little
fantasy land University where they can do this probably but they both look like
professors or assistant professors most the antifa is did they say hey Hispanics
hate that words just people you shouldn't take Gardasil it sterilizes and
reduces fertility massively here's the studies and they in Mexico tied IMF and
World Bank money billions of dollars to giving Hispanic women Gardasil and then
it sterilizes them it reduces their fertility doesn't completely sterilize
them it's statistical but it reduces it and I have people go hey man I've had
this a few times like not with white people even but but it's like they go
hey if you're worried about all them Mexicans or whatever why are you they're
just people I'm gonna put with Mexicans being racist against me don't like me
because I'm quote white even though I'm part Native American I can say
statistically you know I'm Hispanic that's all that means I don't want them
to get screwed me nobody I just want a future together we can all by the time
we reach 50 light years from here we'll all just be basically a nice medium
brown color folks we're probably gonna blow the planet up with let me tell you
right now God gives us a choice I think it's 5050 where we blow the whole
planet up and you know God will just start back over again but God Almighty
God Almighty have I heard one Mitchell or Raza group say you don't take the
Gardasil shot I'd say maybe Mitchell or Raza is a good group but they don't
because they're bought and paid for they want to make you dumb racist to
control you and run your life Anthony Kumi it takes over after this break

live from the inforwars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show
and now your host Anthony Cumia thank you thank you I want to thank Alex Jones
of course very Christmas happy new year to everybody over there over here at
Infowars I was listening to Alex before this for the past probably a half hour
my god my god that the Kate Steinal debacle over there in California it's
heart-wrenching and infuriating just the sheer anger that you feel looking at
something like this from beginning to end the second we heard that she was
murdered right there in front of her dad I mean just a beautiful creative
contributing member of society and it's rare that we see that in in the news
that there's people that actually are doing something and and have a family
structure she's out with her dad how how much more American can you get just a
dad out with his daughter beautiful day out by the water it's it's a it's just
such an affront to everything that we hold dear to us in this country and her
life is snuffed out by someone that shouldn't even have been in this
country it's so easy to see it's so simple for any rational human being to
see the good and the bad in this the right and the wrong the just and the
unjust that we see in this entire story from the moment she was she was killed
until this very second it's not difficult for somebody that has a rational
thought process to see what's wrong here yet he he's not convicted of like
Alex said even manslaughter you pick up a gun and it accidentally discharges and
goes into somebody there's a pretty good case for manslaughter there and that was
the defense saying that's what happened you know and they don't even convict him
of that based on what evidence now it's based on a thought process and a system
over there in California and especially the Bay Area that says that that woman's
life was not worth as much as the life of somebody who was deported five times
obviously a criminal and they let him go because of that this was based on race
and culture and social status all of it the the idea of of justice and weighing
evidence and and doling out punishment for crimes committed had nothing to do
with this the legal proceedings in this case it was all politically motivated all
motivated by the the the liberal agenda in California and especially up there in
the Bay Area and we saw the result of that is the entire country like this
thank God no but there are many areas in this country that are completely the
opposite of what America is supposed to be about and when we come around we get
around to Christmas time which we are the the Christmas season we we get
nostalgic and we start looking back to our our youth and and remembering what
America was back then what celebrating Christmas was how much it was all about
family and common values in this country a common culture the idea that we all
know as Americans what's right what's wrong what's good what's bad that made
this country the place that people did want to come to because the population
of this country and for the most part believe me I know there's been lunatics
and fringes in America since its inception but overall when you think back
to America you think back to a time when there was a common thread through its
people a pride there's a pride in your nation in in living in a place that is
so amazing that people die trying to get here and that's what held it together
that's what held the country together because no matter how different we are
and when they talk about diversity it's our differences but we need a common
factor in there and that's what made us Americans and that common factor was a
basic value system and an ideology that we all held dear and when you look at a
case like Kate Steinal and see that there is a portion of this country
willing to throw all that away they don't want to be a part of the commonality
and thread throughout the American people that made this country a a cohesive
unit because no matter where you come from and what your culture is and what
you brought from the land that you came from or that your ancestors came from to
this country the one thing that that brought it all together that made us
enjoy different foods and different interests and activities religions was
that we were all doing it here in in this amazing country where we weren't
supposed to be persecuted for those things and those ideas where there was a
distinction between good and bad and what you should be doing and shouldn't be
doing in this country that is really going to the wayside and and that's the
thing that people like myself and Alex and so many other people that call
themselves patriots and and to to the laughter of certain people when you say
you're a patriot and you're proud of your country people laugh at that and joke
about it while the whole thing seems to be swirling down the toilet it's because
we have that we remember that we enjoyed it I enjoy thinking back and when you
say make America great again people laugh at that oh Trump's little call sign
no there was a greatness and it had nothing to do with the race or white
supremacy it had to do with that common thread that runs through us as
Americans and always has that ran through that that that makes you do things
for the greater good Americans and if we don't realize that very quickly we're
doomed as a once great nation gonna be back in a matter of moments don't go

Anthony Kumia in at info wars dot com merry Christmas to everybody out there
this is my last broadcast here until the new year so I want to talk a little bit
about about Christmas I was saying just before that break I get a bit nostalgic
I think everybody does when you think of Christmas it's one of those it's one of
those times of the year when you reflect on your youth it was such a big part of
of being a kid your parents family friends and you tend to remember all the
good things when you think back and wax fantastic about days gone by but I think
it truly is one of those times a year where you do remember a lot of good
things that that actually happened and I recall Christmas back I guess it was the
70s I could even remember people late 60s I do remember late 60s maybe first
inklings of of thought process of your pal Anthony was probably 67 68 I
remember I remember things like the Apollo program and used to go to the
gas station with my dad and they would give away they would give away these
little lunar modules that you'd put together like a little model and oh I
loved that I loved the space program and the pride it brought everyone here in
the United States of America just those things from back then and and like I
said before the break when when you say make America great again and people see
hashtag MAGA and and you get this these people that laugh at it or call it
racist or sexist oh you want to go back to this time when people didn't have
rights and people are being beaten in the streets and the no no every country
no matter how great it is has had a period of time that people were being
plagued by injustice doesn't matter how great the country was at the time there
were always problems nothing's perfect and no no one is talking about making
America great again by returning to injustices and nightmares of civil
rights infringements and and whatnot no but when you say make America great
again you're talking about a greatness of the people of this country and and
what I said before about a cohesive people not everyone thinking the same
but just having a common thread of being American and being proud of being
American and who you are your culture your background everything that that your
ancestors brought here is part of what makes this country America and I'm
thinking back at Christmas and and I remember coming into New York City as a
kid during Christmas with my family and it was just an amazing thing the way
the city is decorated and no matter how repulsive New York can be there
there tended to be this niceness that went along with it people were in there
from the suburbs just seeing what what New York City was like at Christmas time
very romantic it's been portrayed in so many movies and whatnot and then I walk
around now and I try to weigh some of the differences because as you know
Christmas in certain parts of the country is a bad word it's not inclusive
enough it's racist it's Islamophobic it's so many terrible things and and as I
say when I hearken back to my youth I just remember it as being great being
just an amazing time you're off of school you're gonna get presents your
family is there there's a little bit more niceness in the streets so walk
around now and what do I say I see soldiers with automatic weapons I see
cement barriers that are set up everywhere to protect people that are
just trying to shop and and walk around and enjoy the sights and see the tree
here and celebrate Christmas signs everywhere see something say something
there's there's an overhanging threat a black cloud hovering over Christmas now
everywhere and this is an exclusive to New York this is every city London you
see these same barriers and look they paint them red and white like they're
supposed to like they're supposed to be festive this is a constant reminder that
there are people out there and cultures out there that want us dead and want our
traditions wiped from the face of the earth including yes of course Christmas
there's people in this very country that sympathize with that that also want our
traditions and cultures wiped away when when when you used to come in to a big
city and celebrate Christmas at least like I said when I was a kid back in the
late 60s early 70s you only thought about Christmas and and how much
fun it was and to walk around now and see the tree and the decorations and
everything it seemed to be that you still capture a little of that but when you
see men walking around various branches of the military and the police forces
walking around with automatic weapons it's a constant reminder and that's it's
just a sad thing that we need to be constantly reminded even at this time
of year that there are cultures that want to eliminate everything that we
hold dear and that is a tradition there you go that's that's great and that's a
tradition to America that that that one of the many traditions that we built
this country on and that separates us from other countries and other cultures
you hear liberals constantly saying live and let live let's be tolerant we
must accept this and that well why are traditional American traditions the
thing that can be sacrificed with impunity and the second you start
defending them you are either a racist or homophobic or Islamophobic is
something some kind of phobic or ist when you're only defending traditions
that you remember and that were great when I think back to this country the
traditional Christmas with your family going out on in the city and and seeing
all the amazing things as a kid can we get back to that I have no idea be back

holiday season Christmas time and what would any Christmas be without the
progressives trying to destroy our traditions it is amazing
Christmas is a holiday that is just fair game fair game for anyone any group
that wants to trot upon it trounce it denounce it twist it and turn it till it's
barely recognizable to the offense of people that hold it dear as a tradition
to them but again people that celebrate Christmas traditionally through through
the liberal left what we've seen from progressives are the most intolerant
people so intolerant yet they happen to be the most tolerant people ever because
no one's rioting when when these people just trounce on on our traditions you
don't see riots you don't see people murdering or beating people in the
streets because we've we've been offended by some of these things I'm gonna
tell you a little story here and I want you to to insert Mohammed in here or
Islam or or any other religion really CNN was hyping a new children's book and
that adorable a children's book about Santa this is great right yeah we suppose
there's supposed to be some sort of shock factor involved in learning there's a
children's book called Santa's husband in which Santa is black and gay but
frankly now that we're aware of it we'd be more surprised if there wasn't such a
thing would we would we be more surprised if there wasn't such a thing as
Santa's husband where Santa is black and gay after seeing the gaitivity scene
with two Joseph's the gaitivity scene why why do they always pick these
Christianity whenever a group wants to crap all over a religion it will always
be Christianity and and the the traditional holidays and services figures
religious figures of Christianity constantly they are able to make Santa
Joseph gay change their race make them gay which would be an affront to oh my
god could you imagine look I don't know if this is proper to say but just imagine
you did whole Mohammed do you think that would fly do you think everyone
involved with doing something like that would need to strap on Kevlar to go to
work every day lest they be gunned down or blown up I do I absolutely do you
know why intolerance we talk about or the progressives talk about Christianity
and and Christmas and all of the holidays pretty much and and our
traditions and basic values of Christianity as being intolerant yet
when our religion and our culture and value system gets crapped on we just
take it we literally turn the other cheek complain about it talk about it
that is our right that is our right but do we take to the streets do we destroy
property do we assault people do we murder people because of it no because
we are tolerant it's another one of these crazy backward world things that go
on when you talk about progressives it's just a grave intolerance going on we
all remember Charlie Hebdo oh boy were they in Dutch when they tried to talk
about Islam yet Christianity can just be used and abused by people the
gaitivity scene I've never I've never heard of the gaitivity scene and now I'm
just hearing about Santa being gay and black there is that the gaitivity scene
now any other religion using any other religious figures in this way I would I
would say that that house would be in flames in no time but they're able to
do this they practice their freedom of expression on their own property and
they get complaints they get people like myself and other people in independent
media that might criticize it but no one's going over there and kicking it
over or throwing a Molotov cocktail through their window because the the
progressives version of the most intolerant people are the most tolerant
people topsy-turvy backward world that we live in I must talk quickly about Rosie
O'Donnell the the giant gift that keeps giving Rosie O'Donnell she's lost her
mind since Trump even said he was running for president a few years back
her and Donald Trump were in a bit of a battle when he was still with the
apprentice and she was so angry with Donald Trump's tax plan that looks like
it will come to fruition that she offered two senators two million dollars
each to vote no on it to vote no this is a crime there it is she promises they
have a two million to senator Susan Collins and two million to senator Jake
Flake to vote no on the tax bill two million dollars apparently this is
against the 18 US code 201 criminalizing the attempt of bribery of federal
officials by whoever and apparently you will be fined three times the amount of
the bribe so she could be fined twelve million dollars and go to prison for
doing this she's insane much like the progressive left is insane but I I give
her one pass and it's like my good friend Michael Malice said on my show
yesterday think about it this is a guy that called her fat called her a slob
said that if she doesn't watch her step he will take her girlfriend away and
believe me I can do it Trump said all these things hilarious hilarious that
guy is now the president imagine somebody that is you and perceived as
bullying you over over the years and calling you horrible things and not
only do do they get away with it they become the leader of the free world so
I almost give Rosie O'Donnell a pass on on her insanity the rest of the left I
don't know what it is self-destructive personality what have you but I really do
hope some branch of the judicial system goes after Rosie O'Donnell for offering
millions of dollars in bribery to senators to vote no on a bill that a
legally elected president and Congress voted on she's out of her mind thank
