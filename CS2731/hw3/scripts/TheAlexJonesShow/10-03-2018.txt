The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show 36 years ago this happened
I had one beer right I had one beer well you think it was nope it was one beer oh good
how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the
place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know I don't know I don't know
what neighborhood was it and I don't know where's the house I don't know upstairs downstairs
where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember and a man's
life is in tatters a man's life is shattered his wife is shattered his daughters who are
beautiful incredible young kids they destroy people they want to destroy people these are
really evil people you know for 10 years I don't know if I never met him but I've been
hearing there's this guy named Brett Kavanaugh who is like a perfect person who is destined
for the Supreme Court I've heard that for a long time and a lot of smart people and
first in his class at Yale top top in his class at Yale Law School he's led like a life that's
unbelievable he's had no problems they've never taken it's Wednesday October 3rd 2018
just 34 days out from the most historic election in world history the global is not just here
but across the world are hanging on to power by their fingernails and in many other areas
they are being rep free by the tide of liberty and the tide of human awakening and sucked
into the black hole of the past and history the ashes that they came from they will become
again thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen as we broadcast worldwide this is
the most hated most demonized most lied about broadcast in the world vaunted for our action
against the globalist thanks to you the listeners the activists the heart and soul of this transmission
thank you so much for joining us I'm gonna have open phones yet again today we have some
special guests as well but I gotta tell you Christina Blasey Ford story is the most ridiculous
deceptive flimsy fiasco that I have ever seen what a spectacle and all the polls show it
will be going over those polls it shows even with skewed polls where they sample 10 15
20% more Democrats in these polls and they target Democrat voters we're seeing 5 10 point
boost in battleground states just the last two weeks why because people hate witch hunts
and they know past behaviors the most indicative of future behavior and the and there would
be other reports over 36 years of Kavanaugh doing bad things they don't just suddenly
pop up days before he's supposed to get confirmed and you got the Democrats sitting on the eggs
sitting on these eggs they've laid and then launching them at the last minute so it's
all unraveling and of course one big giant Fox News breaking it world exclusive that
soros funded activists are running up and down the halls planning to be victims it's
even bigger next week she's today we told you that last week now we have her boyfriend
and others coming out saying she flies all over the place she's into polygraphs is an
expert psi opera on how to get around them well of course is a mind control scientist
what do you think she trains the CIA for she's an expert at cheating polygraphs and who gave
her the polygraph was it mr. strock from the FBI words cannot describe how big the stakes
are for the future of humanity right now info wards is being openly targeted by the democratic
party left to see a operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire soros crime
syndicate people say why would you start a fight with them because they were already
dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future we didn't do this
so we've already had incredible success but if you will simply realize how epic this is
and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if you
financially support us if you spread the word about our articles and videos info wars dot
com we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scum bags will win we have huge
sales and for store dot com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping cart
against us shipped out to you despite the fact to kind of walk our commerce and you're right
to the market but if you don't stand up and support us financially soros the global Spain
win this is info wars darkest hour we your support I'm counting on you waging war on
corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
we've got republican senators being death threaded the restaurants for they either being
threatened with death we don't have people coming up and asking serious questions like
I did of Marco Rubio saying hey fight censorship here in America the media said that I assaulted
him when I was pretty polite till he got in my face that's not what you see for the democrats
they are running up and down the halls yelling screaming calling Mitch McConnell a rapist
in the airport and people see this hysterical witch hunt behavior and major polls we're
going to be getting to in the shower in key battleground states like michigan like colorada
and other areas show five to ten to twelve to fifteen point swings even in democrat pollster
companies where they're already adding a larger sample of democrats on average about fifteen
percent that means trump is probably really at a sixty five right now of eligible voters
that are pulled that is unprecedented going into a midterm election that's why the democrats
are panicked like they were with hillary saying ninety eight percent chance she wins secret
new york times algorithm total garbage and so they smell defeat but let me tell you thirty
four days out you've got rioting the deadly neurotoxin sent to ted cruises houston offices
you've had attempts to send it to the white house and attempts to send it to the pentagon
and remember there's a big article on info wars dot com by steve Watson we name the anti
for groups and professors that pledged you're not safe we're going to get you we're going
to get your family we know where you live so they are the ones creating this atmosphere
that's how crazy it is thirty four days in and the major anti for groups are pledging
led by university professors and others across the country and law enforcement in blue cities
that's come out in the source documents to stage violent uprisings if cabin always confirmed
and or particularly the big red line is if the republicans hold on to the house of senate
and currently i believe you're they're going to have major games you heard that here unless
unless we just let them engage in total election fraud and remember what the states reported
hillary stolled at least five states and she tried to steal six others and they reported
obama's homeland security had computers as they could see the IP addresses breaking into
the state computers but at the state level and the county level people were able to block
it so it is critical to not have the machines in your area plugged into the internet and
to reboot them and wipe them the day of the election because you know sorrow sounds about
half the machines in the country now remember last month when this all first broke we reported
that christine blasey ford that the main protesters directly work for george soros paul joseph
watson article now weeks later it's mainstream news folks i don't just say george soros is
behind this or george soros is behind that he's literally behind everything bad every
time i look sexualization of kids he's behind it open borders he's behind it bring in radical
islam he's behind it pushing weaponized marijuana so strong it puts you into a brain dead coma
he's behind it and i'm not for drug war police state i also want you to know that the weaponized
marijuana has ruined a lot of lives to the point is whatever it is evil bankrupting countries
overthrowing nations sexualizing children the whole revolution to confuse the sex of children
soros is a master villain and now it's all over the news fox exclusive the protesters
all work for soros of course they do so that we're going to get into that but here's the
big news i'm going to cover this when we start the next segment so i have plenty of time
we have witnesses to ford not just her boyfriend but others that have come forward that aren't
getting any attention saying she loved to fly she is a globe trotter there isn't a second
door on her house insane there's a duplex next door it's a duplex but it gets worse that she
trained people how to pass polygraphs what do you think stanford psychologist doctors
that work in cia funded DARPA programs in false memories and implanting memories that's
what she's an expert on her published papers that science fiction stuff oh but then her
grandfather father brother brother-in-law all work high-level cia in international banking
and wait for it funding covert operations destabilizing foreign nations using dirty tricks
we're looking into all of them and it gets better guess what else their specialty is
the russia dossier that's right it's like saying it was al capone in the italian mafia
or is the or is the last name capone italian or is alex jones wearing a gray shirt they're
watching on tv yes and a dark brown sports jacket or is you know does that say info wars
dot com behind me this is two plus two equals four in fact it's beyond that it's holding
up a flashcard to a three-year-old saying what's this number and they go it's a two it's
not even two plus two equals four it's this woman is a thoroughbred deep state hillary
worshiping psych warfare leftist cultural saboteur i mean what is her stock in trade have you
asked the question you know is she a globalist is she an operative do bears live in the woods
do bears sleep in the woods do bears crap in the woods i don't know let's put the video
back up on screen the tv viewers you know the answer to that this is ridiculous so when
we come back there's witnesses that nobody's talking about not just her boyfriend on record
for many years and then you've got the boyfriend of the other woman and all and and and restraining
orders and death-threading families and just a bunch of whack job crazy women professors
just like the other woman senior professor at georgetown saying she wants to kill cabin
off kill all the members of congress and vote for him and chop their balls off that's right
castrate them i mean it's a family show they're the one saying this and she won't get any
trouble because these people are wound up into a crazed foam at the mouth system so that's
all coming up after the break now let me just stop right there this is the last day maybe
another day because i've got to come up with new specials to get our best selling new tropic
for the brain that in a healthy good way gives you incredible energy clarity focus everybody
loves it it overall is the best seller right up there with x2 and things this x2 is the
most profitable to fund us because it costs more but brain forces is overall the number

you're listening to the alex jones show you're listening to the antidote for fake news
it's alex jones show we know something about the crazed democrats the chicoms that fund
them the anti-american hollywood scum whose religion is is that they own and run america
and they would run the country into the ground and destroy it so that they could feel like
they were better than it so it is a real issue of people that are projecting their hatred
of themselves on to us that's why the globalist are such trash now the hunchback demons up
there in congress like cori booker and i'm saying he's spiritually hunchback and diane
feinstein and others have lied the whole time moved the gold post down the road and then
every time one woman gets discredited and every witness says there was never a party
we were never there they never have any witnesses but they remember every other little detail
except what year it was and what neighborhood it was and what house they both move on to
a new allegation i have seen three different news reports since last week of different
letters or phone calls where someone sends a letter no name no return address saying
i saw cavin all rape my daughter in the back of a car thirty five years ago and then it's
all over the news i saw the Loch Ness monster in my toilet this morning won't have any proof
of it so they just move on to the next fraud and now they're just saying whether he's guilty
or not cori booker says we just need to not confirm it it's called authoritarianism the
good news is they're bullying and their intimidation is radicalizing even the blue blood republicans
to understand what a clear and present danger the criminal democrat party is allied with
the chai comms and how their election meddling through hollywood and the chai com funding
now the chai comms are running full page ads and magazines and newspapers all over this
country so let's get in to the bombshell proof first off tomorrow's news today here
is a paul joseph watchin september sixth that's almost a month ago two thousand eighteen
man caught paying off cabinal protest works for soros funded organization and is a lawyer
we name him and we name the other soros operatives who were then drug out by the police look
at fox news the big exclusive anti-cabinal protesters accosting senators have ties to
soros really you think so he only spends billions a year trying to overthrow this country now
let's move on to the other witnesses we don't just have all five of her original witnesses
saying it never happened and her saying about one of her old friends that said never happened
oh she's been sick and dealing with some problems and she sent me a letter saying sorry talk
to my lawyer but she said the statement under penalty of perjury felony perjury that it
never happened and she doesn't remember any of it period that clips coming up next segment
this is going to take this segment the next to go through this so the story is up on info
wars dot com it's the best boil down from information liberation bombshell fords x
boyfriend says she had no fear of flying or living in in close spaces helped friend prep
for polygraph but when we come back we have the specific video of her sit looking down
and going I know nothing about polygraphs it's like handing me a remington seven hundred
three oh eight and I can shoot bulls out a thousand yards and I get the gun first time
shoot bulls out of it I got no I don't I know nothing about remington seven hundreds I know
nothing about it the woman is a psych warfare operative working in huge DARPA mind control
program that's what it is implanting false memories removing memories creating false
realities close quote what do you think they train operatives to do at the psychology facilities
at stanford they train them to beat polygraphs or the first things you get taught to do you
can read it in the declassified documents but there you go this lady's connected to the
defense language school who do you think they're training there we got folks in this building
that were trained at the defense language school that's where spooks go to get trained
not Easter bunnies not little cutesy baby talking women let's continue bombshell and
then it goes through all the evidence the next segment I'm going to read through all
of this but let's get to the witnesses that no one's talking about and no one's giving
any attention info wars dot com travel photos ex-boyfriend sworn statement seals Ford's
fate as a liar that's right she traveled to New Zealand over and over again and thought
about relocating there was a globalist are taking that over she went to Hawaii she went
to all these places recently but now she has fears of wide open places that's why she
kayaks in the middle of big lakes that's why she paddle boards it's why she travels we
pull this article up show TV viewers all the way from the United States to New Zealand
all of this coming out all of this ex-boyfriend of christine Ford says she wasn't afraid of
flying or close spaces and it just goes from there so who are the other witnesses it's
her it's her record it's her history they tried to expunge her social media they tried
to expunge her Stanford record they tried to expunge the reviews but we were able to
save a lot of them and turns out she never once talked about fear of open spaces or fear
of travel in fact she traveled the world but it turns out she said it's all these articles
that New Zealand wasn't far enough away trying to reinvent herself but I'd say she's reinvented
herself now as an RU 486 operative writing papers for it trying to stop Kavanaugh who
might be against it and she's done quite a job at Stanford other universities working
in programs that deal with implanted memories but let me tell you there's not many places
you can fly further than to New Zealand what is that a 18 hour flight I mean I guess Bangkok
maybe is a little bit further from California maybe the middle of Russia I don't know the
point is it's about as far away maybe Antarctica maybe the bottom of the planet that's that's
four or five thousand miles further for cupcake maybe the tip of Chile maybe the Horn of Africa
I don't know maybe Easter Island so oh it's only 12 hours 50 minutes so I guess it's close
well that shows no fear of flying because she remember she couldn't fly that last week
because they had to dig up some more professors and it's all professors oh a professor that
Kavanaugh no evidence shows ever knew who went to yell with him some other professor
says he saw a guy get in his face and Kavanaugh threw ice on him and the guy got arrested
who the hell knows if that's even true oh and then these other women their boyfriends
and fiancees and people gone public and said that they had to call the police on one of
these other women but I know this I've had them in the media and law firms involved in
it from the Democrats make up stories about me and you look at you go why did they say
such weird stories that make no sense because they think if it's some really weird thing
that oh it must be true because you would make something up like that like I'm hopping
around the office and swastika shoes and you know saying any Semitic things and all this
other made up crap they just make it up and then they stick it in their filthy newspapers
and they destroy good people's lives these people don't have consciences ever wonder

now it's time to change our bodies with z-shield infowarslife.com living in volcano may sound
more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a
lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and
acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH
of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity
filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored
to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it you're listening to
the alex jones show i'm no stranger to the rain i'm a friend of thunder friend is it any
wonder a lightning strikes me i fought with the devil got down on his level but i never
gave in so he gave it for me i tell you when i started talking about jesus more on air
now this is a spiritual fight and when i crossed the river con i know about six seven years
ago and really wasn't tempted by evil anymore by real evil that's when the world really
started coming after me but that's when the doors of the universe began to open up as
well my relationship with god got even stronger it's amazing but that's a good old keith whitley
that's one of the few guys that give george straighter run for his money and he died young
that's a really good song and i fought with the devil got down on his level but i never
gave in so he gave up on me that's what you want folks want the devil to give up on you
and then you start trying to destroy it because that's when you get close to god that's when
god starts to move in to your life when you really start seeing god now let's get back
to the evil we're fighting and believe me it's pure evil as you know and it's going to manifest
itself become that much more obvious ladies and gentlemen
ford is a disgusting creation of the deep state her entire male family are spooks and
they're not like army or marine corps soldiers or officers assigned to real operations they're
the ones that run our lives they're the ones that control the schools they're the ones
that push hollywood to inject the poison into our culture they're the abortion pushers
they're the break up the family peddlers they're the transgender promoters they're the plague
they're solid death you know i remember reading the john mers society stuff they wrote fifty
years ago about globalist world government operatives inside of the intelligence agencies
and how they were putting on ugly art and ugly literature and ugly architecture and
how they wanted to destroy the family now they wanted to merge us with china and now our government
put mouse a tongue in and all of it turned out to be absolutely dead on spot on people
ask how i'm so dead on well i had the right foundation because the john mers society was
founded by patriots in our government that were aware of what was going on and we're
battling what we know is the globalist today and people like buried goldwater came out
of the hole awakening ronald reagan was uh... fully aware of the bert society and informed
on that and i'm not a member of the john bert society you know my dad gave anti-communist
speeches and even hosted a radio show when he was in high school in dallas he'd drive
up friday afternoons and tape it was on the wbap but uh... this is what we're dealing
with ladies and gentlemen and and it's the real deal and folks need to just get their
head screwed on straight and realize that we're facing a world government corporate
system that wants a final revolution even over the biology between men and women and
to have a total monopoly over reproduction why do you think cobear of the hundreds of
times he's attacked me always makes jokes about jones claims are putting stuff in the
water because that's their prime operation now you understand that ninety nine percent
of people in government are involved in this you understand the president's trying to stop
all this and try to release all the suppressed technologies in energy and in health and in
other areas of science and they're blocking he can't even get three levels down to do
what he says but they made a mistake they made a big mistake they transferred dictatorial
powers to the presidency under clinton bush and obama and trump is annihilating them with
it right now so he can kill their deals and have it revert back to what it was and just
him sticking his foot in the door this is the best analogy i've come up with a long
time the globalists were closing that big old giant vault door to seal us in our tombs
and laughing at us the whole time while they did it the art type of supervillains bragging
is really true i used to watch movies and cartoons and i was a kid with a supervillain's bragging
and then like i wouldn't brag about a supervillain but that's in the criminal psychology the globalist
write books and brag and tell you what they're gonna do like you're too stupid to even read
it or too stupid to stop them now they're not arrogant like that anymore they got those
big fat smiles wiped right off their stinking faces but we have their blueprint we have
their operation we can stop them and trump has rammed his foot in the big door and it's
bleeding and it's smashed and he knows though everybody's gonna be slaves his family us
you the prosperity all gone he doesn't like wrecking a good big powerful country when it
comes down to he doesn't need to piss on america to feel big and he's sitting over this foot
bleeding and smashed and guess what my foot shoved the door to and your foot shoved the
door with what you go through at work and church or life for stand up for what's right
but it matter everybody better stick their foot in the door and then do something else
take your fingers and stick them in there and start pushing and pulling that door open
and that's what's starting to happen is that they want to smash those of us that already
have our foot in the door but guess what more people's feet are going in the door right
now and the cavalry's coming up over the hill and the globalists are in full panic mode
I said I get to all these clips I did in this segment next segment I'll get into all of
her lying all of her deception and the rest of their official stories of the wheels coming
off and I saw the talking points from Swallowswell and Cory Booker and all the rest of them on
the news this morning while I was working out and the new talking point is it doesn't
matter find investigate Kavanaugh investigate the Ford investigate all of them just now
there's too big a cloud just push it off or remove the nominee well they vote them down
on friday because Mitch McConnell says that vote's coming they're talking about re nominating
him again that's what Lindsey Graham's talking about and then buying more time to let things
unravel even more we'll see what unfolds but Graham seems to be committed to Kavanaugh

welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm gonna get into meat potatoes now of
wazzy ford and others it's all just disintegrating it's just it always disintegrated and then
it's worse than we thought she's a globe trotter coaster rica new zealand she trains people
reportedly as a psychologist of course how that works in strange DARPA programs with
her whole family in the CIA about how to get around lie detectors gee wonder who trains
people for that and just all of it it's ridiculous but now they've moved on just saying well you
can't have cabin on period will you get confirmed it's on the razor's edge will it get pushed
back past friday mcconnell says no but feinstein thinks she can stop it disgraceful let's
start going to the clips here's a flashback christine ford is questioned about her fear
of flying and again the articles on info wars dot com of her traveling the world just recently
and her boyfriend former boyfriend said she was never afraid of flights and i sat there
and saw her train her friend how to take a polygraph test here it is may i ask dr ford
how did you get to washington in a airplane okay it's i asked that because it's been
reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because
of your fear of flying is that true i was willing i was hoping that they would come
to me but then i realized that was an unrealistic request it would have been a quicker trip for
me that was certainly what i was hoping was to avoid having to get on an airplane but i
eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the
plane when you were here in the mid mid atlantic area back in august end of july august how
did you get here also by airplane i come here once a year during the summer to visit my
family okay i'm sorry not here i go to delaware okay um in fact you fly fairly frequently
for your hobbies and your you've had to fly for your work is that true correct unfortunately
um you you were a consulting bio statistician in sydney australia is that right i've never
been to australia but the company that i worked for is based in australia and they have an
office in san francisco california okay i don't think i'll make it to australia it is
long um i also saw on your cv that you list the following interests of surf travel and
you in parentheses put hawaii costarica south pacific islands in french polynesia have you
been on to those places correct by airplane yes and your interest also i fall asleep
on three and four hour flights in europe's okay but let me tell you something 15 hour
flights i've done them i dread them just because after like 10 hours you're like get me out
of this damn thing starts getting claustrophobic this woman loves it oh but she couldn't fly
the week before she was a free i'm afraid i'm a little baby i work in implanted memories
in a DARPA facility and do stuff for the defense language school and everything but my whole
family's in the cia high level but i'm a sweet little lady oh you talk like a baby i can't
come you need to wait a few weeks and delay it i'm scared i'm scared now i have PTSD i'm
scared but look at the real face because i saw she would go from like the little fake
act like like strong the country's eyes stop pushing it's all control now you put the mean
back up of her next to uh next to strong please when they're both making that face like private
powerful metal jacket i am in a world of you know what
country now get out of the way the pleasure of being in power and having control and implanted
memories and hypnotizing people seeking power let's go back to the club sir so continuing
here she is 40 explains why she decided to take a polygraph test and now they've had
the FBI guy on fox we've got the clip he gave her two questions you give someone 20 plus
questions if it's a real one and still it's not conclusive 20 plus just to get their
reading before you ask the real questions a real polygraph has over 100 questions that's
on average but she got to let's continue where she explains why she decided to take a polygraph
and now her boyfriend says that he saw her helping train someone on how to pass one here
it is based on the advice of the council it was happy to undergo the polygraph test although
i found it extremely stressful much longer than i anticipated i told my whole life story
i felt like i endured it it was fine i understand they can be that way have you ever taken
any other polygraphs in your life never okay you went to see a gentleman by the name of
Jeremiah hannah finn to serve as the polygrapher did anyone advise you on that choice attorney
clad privilege she's that literally the deep state yes i believe his name was jerry jerry
hannah finn yeah and he has two questions did anyone advise you on that choice i don't
understand that oh wait that's not a polygraph test the person that came to do the polygraph
test ask your name your parents what you did the polygraph dog his office in virginia
but actually at the hotel next to baltimore washington airport is that right correct
why was that location chosen for the polygraph i had left my grandmother's funeral at fort
lincoln cemetery that day and was on tight schedule to get a plane to manchester new
hampshire so he was willing to come to me which was appreciated and then she goes on
to say she's never known anything about polygraphs didn't even know what they are funeral yeah
or it might have been the next day i spent the night in the hotel so um for the exact
day he's a literal mind control doctor have you ever had discussions with anyone uh besides
your attorney's one of her papers on how to take a polygraph never oh no she just knows
about mind control about polygraphs just any sort of tips or anything like that oh no no
no i was scared of the test itself oh she's scared hit pause she's like i'm scared i'm
scared i can't fly i can't in my little shell but the reviews in college said she's the worst
she's vindictive she's lazy she's horrible she's in a group hypnosis brainwashing but
she's scared little girl and she's go back that up 10 seconds ryan stelter says she's
scared here let's hear it again any sort of tips or anything like that no i was scared
of the test itself that was comfortable that i could tell the information and the test i
mean who do you think they're going to get to go up and say this i'm mind control doctor
hooked into darpa the whole family's in the cia i rest my case we're going to go to bright
come back and play some of the other clubs and then i'm going to get into all the other
news open the phones up and take your calls and i got mitch mcconnell's saying we're not
going to be intimidated we're not going to back down the democrats pushing this far have

these witnesses lying again god oh but even the new york times can't even say oh is she
credible oh we're so sorry you can't ask if she's credible i mean she's a bug-eyed hillary
supporting man-hating uh spook in my view yeah we hell we know her whole family ish
and she's the nasty academic type that perches on top of country not the spooks that actually

to the committee yes and are you aware of what those statements say yes um are you aware
that they say that they have no memory or knowledge of such a party yes do you have
any particular motives to ascribe to leland i guess we could take those one at a time
um leland has uh significant health challenges and i'm happy that she's focusing on herself
and getting the health treatment that she needs and she let me know that she needed
her lawyer to take care of this for her and she texted me right afterward with an apology
and good wishes and etc so i'm glad that she's taking care of herself we are back live ladies

wars store dot com you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you
are receiving this transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of fema
region six austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones we are about to air the video
proof that hillary clinton john pedestrian and the dnc are behind the move to ban info
wars and then every other major conservative or libertarian or nationalist or christian
or pro gun or veteran group off the internet it's in the wiki leaks from three years ago
but it's in her statements going back a year and a half ago right through last month where
she brags how they defined info wars as fake news and russian propaganda to make america
great again and how she got big tech to then ahead of the midterms only 30-something days
out to ban us this is an admission of racketeering an admission of antitrust an admission of civil
rights violations an admission of big tech corporate democrat run mafia crushing info
wars and your ability to comment on our articles in our videos we're going to air this piece
right now this is so incredibly important this is a big deal because if they can shut
down info wars they can shut everybody down and that's their plan demonize us get people
to abandon us so the next person they attack nobody stands up as well they believe they're
breaking your will right now i believe they're waking you up this is what the witch had to
say herself you cannot make this stuff up and i tell you all of it i could literally
keep you here all night because the stories are just so unbelievable this is coming to
a theater near you the epidemic the malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded
social media over the past year it's now clear that so-called fake news can have real world
consequences the russians in my opinion and based on the intel and counter intel people
i've talked to could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they
had been guided and here's a here's a guide by americans guided by americans and so voters
who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up
their minds what does it mean it's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly
bipartisan legislation is making its way through congress to boost the government's response
to foreign propaganda and silicon valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and
threat of fake news there have been a series of studies academic studies since the election
trying to figure out why people voted the way they did because it defied all the polls
nobody was ready for it and people relied on what they saw in the media but even more
so online it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones who claims
that nine eleven and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs but trump doesn't challenge
these lies he actually went on jones's show and said your reputation is amazing i will
not let you down you will be very very impressed i hope we've got a statement now with regard
to paypal and reports that has ended its relationship with info wars paypal joining the slew of tech
companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist alex jones hitting his info wars
where it hurts by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor paypal is the
latest company to sever ties with jones after youtube apple spotify twitter facebook and
pinterest social media giants acting this time before it's too late their goal to prevent
fake news and propaganda from influencing the upcoming us midterm election i'm glad
that the congress and others are looking at facebook and twitter and google because they
are the vehicles of one of the very first vehicles to deliver this kind of information
to people and then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their
allies within the uh internet world like info wars take out pieces and began to say the
most outrageous outlandish absurd lies you can imagine if something popped up in a facebook
feed and looked like a news report people were inclined to believe it and if they were already
targeted psychologically to be receptive to the information provided uh they were influence
able info wars comes to mind where those are echo chambers the white house and the president
are citing info wars the real election meddling is by facebook and google and others that are
shadow banning people that are outright banning people and their blocking conservatives involved
in their own first amendment political speech shame on the mainstream corporate media for
not defending the first amendment but instead a tap dogging calling for federal regulators
to shut down independent free press working with big tech
now i'm going to air a video of oan benjamin breaking down what he says happened to him
at the hands of matt damon now i did an intro video last night that's not the one i want
to air i want to air the one specifically with just what he said so people can see this
for themselves and we're going to be talking to oan benjamin here so again let's uh go
ahead and go to that club i've i'm finally ready because of the courage of christine
blasey ford to come forward in such a terrible time to tell my story and i need to be believed
i was raped by matt damon i don't remember exactly what year but it was right around
when goodwill hunting came out and there is no goodwill when he hunted me and raped me
amy do you remember me telling you that yeah totally remember yeah oh look a woman she remembers
do you remember that i said he raped me yeah totally bad damon it's time for the reckoning
you rape me and now i'm gonna um i want 750 grand article matt damon accused of rape
and then it goes on to point out that uh this is him illustrating what's what's going on
with absurdity it's up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com he does hang out in
his best buddies with a known uh serial rapist and assaulter harry winstein so it has more
credibility uh he has these associations in his hollywood uh than it does to say this
is about cabana but you were going to be here in studio today but i heard that matt damon
sabotage your flight there's no need for due processor proof uh is there oh and benjamin
uh just because you are accusing a man of something because matt damon is a man uh we've
got to go ahead and i guess he should ever work again right yeah i mean i was always
very skeptical of the me too movement because i thought it was a uh a pound symbol so i thought
it was pound me too which is very confusing but when i saw matt damon on saturday night
live mocking an innocent man i the voice his voice triggered something in me and i i remember
him raping me i don't know the time or the place uh i remember uh when he was finished
he said how do you like them apples and that's when i started to weep and um i guess that's
all the information you really need these days uh to get you know 750 grand and as you saw
my wife who's half minority she's half hispanic so that gives her even more credibility she's
a woman and also half not white so it's i think it's a crime to not believe that she's
telling the truth that i did well that's what mazy the uh senator in hawaii said she said
men just sit down and shut up yeah but it's time for me to stand up and tell my story
that matt damon academy award-winning matt damon gave me the hard r and uh he never apologized
and he never looked at and he's a big guy he's a big guy you're a little guy i'm uh yeah
i'm six seven and uh he's about five nine but in my mind he was about nine foot eight
and uh and that's credible well i appreciate your courage let's talk about what he did
to you when he we know how you rape a guy we oh this is terrible he got a lot of courage
right now matt damon's got a lot of explaining to wow the united states of empire is a book
that claims the united states is the empire of the world george washington had warned
us against foreign wars the united states of empire shows that world wars one and two
left england broken its former colony the us had to save the empire was there ever a
vote who do we fight for the deep state began with world war one the united states of empire

to the alex jones show
from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
all right I love having Owen Benjamin on the show we're the most censored comedians out
there he's been popping on a lot of listeners loving and he's been watching this whole
cabin off of us go everything Ford says everything these other women say none of the witnesses
say it happened and then Ford says well she's sick and it's just otherworldly and then she's
involved in a weird DARPA program to implant memories in people and then she's a globetrotter
bragging how she's you know and Tahiti or whatever and everywhere else Costa Rica and
then she says I'm free to fly and I was afraid of the polygraph they only gave her two questions
which is not a polygraph maybe like 20 30 40 questions just to warm you up but but but
getting serious here because it's obviously satire and you're illustrating absurd about
being absurd we even said it was a joke in the article you know in one paragraph before
the video people like oh how dare you say this for clickbait we're not doing that we're
putting it out so let's explain I mean Matt Damon really didn't rape you unless you went
and I guess went to this Christine Blasey Ford's class and then she did a hypnosis on you and
then I guess maybe if you believe that Matt Damon raped you maybe it's true point we're
obviously trying to make there's more evidence that Matt Damon raped me because there isn't
five people saying that he didn't like if we go by the leftist standard of rape accusation
equals destroy an honorable man's life Matt Damon is far more guilty than Judge Kavanaugh
of raping me because I was going to fly down to the studio today as you know and I sat on
a tarmac today because the plane broke for six hours and allegedly Matt Damon broke the
plane because he didn't want the secret out like there's a couple people being like no
way it's Matt Damon and I'm like oh that is my rapist see anyone can just make this stuff
up it's it's just it's ridiculous and and we need due process because you can't prove
a negative I know you've had this Alex and I know I've had this when you're accused of
something you can't prove you're not something it's a logic inverse that that makes it so
someone can just have control over you so that's why instead of just in a constant state of
backpedal I now am just doing the same thing to them except in a way that's obviously sad
tire because I don't want to bear false actual witness you're not actually trying to destroy
their lives but you're lucky where does Matt Damon as a gremlin he can take on that form
got into the belly of the plane ripped up some of the avionics and things could have
been worse you could have been on the wing of the plane and Damon wanted me to survive
though because he doesn't want to kill his victims because he likes to know that I get
triggered every time I hear how you like them apples or even if I use an apple product I
think about goodwill hunting and of course the vicious rape so it would have been a
mercy kill if he did take down the plane he knows that seven how was Matt Damon in this
this dream this false memory that planted as it stand well he's part elephant and he has
little and and Ben Affleck was there laughing all I remember is the laughter Alex I don't
remember where it was I just remember that there were stairs and laughter and for that
I want 750 grand and any of my other enemies want to talk smack well guess what you were
there too raping away and I want more money and I want you fired too well right she'd
raise 750,000 as of the day she testified what is it now I heard it was over a million
I'm sure and her ex-boyfriend just came out I'm sure you saw this where they used to always
be on prop planes he witnessed her and he swore this he just swore this with fear of
perjury that that he witnessed her coaching another woman how to take a lie detector test
and she got him for bank fraud this this news just came out like late late last night and
the mainstream media won't report it like she's a proven liar and that she's not afraid
to fly and it's not only we just have to believe him we have the witnesses of her own saying
she's a club trotter loves to fly flies to places 16 hours away well yeah and as you
know the leftist use our own morality and our own sense of honor against us and and
I'm I'm I'm on to him at this point and I know you are as well that they will just use
our deference to actual victims that really do need to be heard like the victims of Harvey
Weinstein for example and they'll use and they'll use that to put us in a state of fear
and a state of immobility and that is when they just acquire power and if they get total
power we're in gulags and that's why my role is to fight it with satire like I'll do these
it's time videos and sudden and jokes and stuff like that and that's good at waking
people up to the absurdity of it but you know everyone has the role to play but at this
point more Americans need to shoulder the burden of fighting the leftist globalist
nonsense is truth everything is power this Machiavellian nightmare that's happening because
it's easy to beat if you just say what you believe they're really asking this question
because we're gonna go to break them back and play Mitch McConnell saying they won't
be bullied some other clips polls show and I'm gonna get to when we come back that major
shifts in battleground stage for Republicans for Trump now this somehow just the witch
shunt went too far and all the witnesses saying it didn't happen and her remembering not the
house of the year whatever but she had a beer and what they were wearing in the room and
but she didn't tell anybody and then none of the friends say it's true and then she's
a globetrotter but a lot about that and then her whole family CIA left us kook balls I
mean I really think they have gone too far here yeah they've woken up a lot of people
like I've had just this week a few people that are more higher up in LA that haven't
talked to me in a while like text me how I'm doing and stuff because I think they finally
saw that appeasement just means you get eaten last and it's a lot harder to dismiss Kavanaugh
like this centrist Eagle Scout you know Yale guy like the left was trying to prove that
they can do it to anybody at any time even Mike Pence who never is alone with a woman
they could do this they could say well a ghost was touched like they they there's they're
trying to do a power display where no one's safe and that caused a chill there's gonna
be a red wave 100% there's no way people that I know that aren't never would vote and think
I'm crazy are like dude we can't let the Democrats take over the house these people are insane
they've weaponized rape accusations like that's a sacred thing like rape is horrible and it's
like you can't do this to men because men are naturally protective so we're gonna believe
women a lot of times and then when you see the obvious you know Feinstein this archaic
war leech like when you see someone like that in their real motives it makes you just well
that's it is they are raping the truth and you have this coach saying our team got raped
by the revs and he gets suspended or fired we're now with they're even raping language
Oh well the rape of the language is how the left does it you know they I'm starting to
realize the reason that they actually banned to kill a mockingbird my mom teaches literature
is it's not actually the n-word which the real n-word is no by the way but it's because
it shows due process it shows what the story of to kill a mockingbird exactly the left
stay there when we come back we'll talk about this they're at war with due process yeah
oh yeah because they need power all right actually the professor said while the left
one is a fan he's a nice white guy trying to be a good guy which is what abolition and
all that was well you can't have Gregory Peck who was a liberal by the way a classical
liberal you can't have a white guy in a good role that is the new hyper racist garbage
of the weird white professor saying that it's not minorities saying that we'll be right
back

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Coming up, I'm going to play a clip of Sarah Sanders
at her press conference just minutes ago,
pointing out that the Democrats have undermined
the entire judicial system.
It's not that the judicial system's perfect,
or that America's perfect, but the Democrats
work for globalists.
They work for Soros, who undermines
and overthrows nation-states to implode them
to bring in corporate world government.
So, yes, they are an outside globalist arm.
Owen Benjamin's our guest.
We're going to get to some of these clips,
and it is taking where he thinks things are going.
I'm going to then give the number out
and take some of your calls.
We've got a special report from the leader
of the restart movement that is one of the main
opposition groups.
The MULOS and Iran.
This is going to be a pretty big interview coming up
that our own Greg Reese did.
So we're going to play some excerpts of that.
The interview is now on infowars.com.
That said, you know, any product we launch
is pretty darn powerful.
And I had it earlier, but I took it in the other studio
here, stayed to shoot a video with it,
and also took some of it, so it's down here with me.
But HAPPIES is our newest product at infowarslife.com.
And it's just a whole bunch of known, concentrated herbs,
ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passion flower herb,
green tea leaf, licorice root, and more organic concentrated

They're not suppressants, though.
They just smooth you out.
I'll start drinking a lot of this myself.
I tell you, but I want you to try it.

It's not a depressant.
It's amazing.
So infowarsstore.com or triple 8253-3139.
I took a bunch of it yesterday when I went home.
I took like twice that doesn't recommend it does.
I was like, are you drunk?
I was like, no, I haven't been drinking.
He's just, you're in a really good mood.
You're usually kind of grumpy by 10 o'clock at night.
You're back to really silly.
And I'm just telling you, it's the HAPPIES.
So everybody's physiology is different.
This is all mother nature stuff.
It's how you fund us, get t-shirts, get books.
The globalists hate it when you fund us.
Now we're going to go back to a very popular national comedian,
Owen Benjamin, who's one of the most banned comedians out there,
because he has a line in the sand.
And I want to get his take on where he thinks all this ends.
With the polls I'm going to get to in a moment showing huge surges
for Republicans in battleground states.
But the Democrats just can't help themselves.
They have to execute the corrupt power they have.
And they just can't help it.
They can't think a few moves ahead.
But here's Mitch McConnell, who's been the establishment's buddy.
He's getting hounded, called a rapist at airports.
Everybody else is.
You know, when I hound somebody at an airport,
I'm like, hey, why don't you move to Venezuela?
Communism's so good, Bernie Sanders.
And everybody goes, oh, he's so mean to him.
I was very polite.
But they're calling him a rapist.
Rape, rape, rape, rape.
Chasing him around the media is like, oh, this is a really good thing.
So here's Mitch McConnell this morning.
They've tried to bully and intimidate members of this body.
Republican United States senators.
They've tried to bully and intimidate us.
One of our colleagues and his family were effectively run out of a restaurant
in recent days by these people.
Another reported having protesters physically block his car door.
And some have seen organized, far-left protesters camp out at their homes.
I'm not suggesting we're the victims here, Mr. President,
but I want to make it clear to these people who are chasing my members around the hall here
or harassing them at the airports or going to their homes, will not be intimidated by these people.
There is no chance in the world they're going to scare us out of doing our duty.
I don't care how many members they chase, how many people they harass here in the halls.
I want to make one thing perfectly clear, we will not be intimidated by these people.
This is all part of the organized effort to delay, obstruct, and intimidate,
including those of us who will be voting this week.
And he goes on to say the vote will happen on Friday.
I've got one more clip and we'll get Owen Benjamin's take on that.
Here is the ACLU that won't defend the First Amendment of Conservatives, Libertarians, and Christians now,
but they do a shocking video mixing in Bill Clinton,
who's a known, admitted sexual predator who's settled a bunch of rape cases,
and flies around on pedophile aircraft, with Bill Cosby, who is creepy and weird
and giving women ludes and getting drunk. They're coming to his house.
I think there's some lynch mob going on here, and I'm not just defending him.
He's a conservative black guy. I mean, I'm not defending him.
I think, you know, the jury found him guilty. Okay.
But I still have some questions. But Kavanaugh, there's no history of this.
He's not on pedophile airplanes. He's not settling rape cases,
and then the Democrats defended him over the years.
So that's why this is such a disgusting piece from the ACLU. Here it is.
We've seen this before, denials from powerful men.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
I've never seen anything like this.
I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.
America is watching, and as we choose a lifetime seat on our highest court,
integrity matters, and we cannot have any doubt.
Senator Gardner, oppose the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.
So the ACLU is now against due process and shows a convicted sex abuser,
basically a rapist that's what he's convicted of, Bill Cosby,
and then a guy the Democrats defended who settled rape cases
and hangs around with no pedophiles on airplanes with little kids.
And so now that's Kavanaugh. So because these guys did something wrong,
they're now not just for due process.
Oh, and Benjamin, they are now actually saying if another man
never did something, it's like saying if a black man did something wrong,
all black men are guilty. Here, if a white man did it, all white men.
This is the most bigoted, backwards authoritarian thing I've ever heard of.
Yeah, I mean, they think in demographics. That's how they think.
They put you in a category and then you have collective guilt
that you have nothing to do with.
The good news is, though, the silver lining is it's going to just iron out.
It's going to get rid of the middle. I call them the zebras.
Because zebras are striped because the stripes don't look like the Serengeti.
They're stripes that they can fit in with other zebras.
So that's why they stay in a pack.
If you just mark a zebra, a lion will immediately kill them.
So that's why there's millions of Americans that I call zebras that are just kind in the middle.
They're like, they think like my grandfather was a lead miner and a Democrat.
That Democratic Party is gone.
And this event will make people, this is the lie in the sand
where someone now tells me they're on the left.
I'm like, you know what they did to Kavanaugh.
You know that they're ruining good men with power acquisition.
It's like you're not, you can't just tow that line anymore.
You have to make a stance with truth or a stance against it.
That's right. That's the wheat from the chaff.
We're making a decision right now.
We're going to come back and get your prediction for the future and more straight ahead.
The next hour we'll take some calls and we've got a special guest in studio.
Stay with us.
I mean, that is so pure.
It just goes right into your body when you take it.
We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now,
but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago.
So I get the price down.
I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
I'm breaking the contract.
Well, I broke the contract last week.
And so this is potentially the last run.
In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2.
And we've got a good supply of it.
It'll be gone a couple of months.
X2, if you haven't experienced it in FullWarsHore.com, if you have experienced it,
I suggest you stop up on it.
It's available right now for a limited time at FullWarsHore.com right now.

we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains
unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate,

Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
FullWarsHore is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party,
left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department,
and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
People say, why would you start a fight with them?
Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
So we've already had incredible success.
But if you will simply realize how epic this is,
and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
and if you financially support us,
and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at FullWarsHore.com,
we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
We have huge sales at FullWarsHore.com right now.
And we're still able to operate the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you,
despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce, and you're right to the market.
But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
Soros and the Globalists may win.
With FullWars Darkest Hour, with your support, I'm counting on you.

You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
Owen Benjamin is our guest, and we are just watching the insane spectacle
of just weaponized media, and none of the stories adding up,
and no witnesses, and people saying,
I don't fly on airplanes, I'm scared, and they're all over the world.
And oh, I don't know anything about polygraphs, and they advise people
how to pass them, and it's like, where does it go from here?
Where does it go with the corporate media trying to weaponize
men and women against each other?
And it's in the WikiLeaks how they want race war,
and then I've got a clip we'll plan a moment.
Kanye West is talking to some nobody TMZ reporter,
and they tell him, take that off your head.
Like, he's a slave.
I don't say that because he's black.
I mean, it's like, I'm saying make America great again.
The cult-like control over corporate media has just become insane.
So, Owen Benjamin, where do you think all this ends?
Well, I think we're seeing the sleeping giant of American patriotism
waking up finally, and I think the future's bright for people
that go indie and just do it family style and just keep it going.
I just self-produced a special.
You can get it at hugepianist.com, because if Netflix won't have me anymore
or Comedy Central that I've done two specials with,
because Susan Rice is on the board of Netflix, it's like, that's cool.
We still have America, so I shot my own and just put it up,
and people can enjoy it, just like you doing independent news.
And that's what gets me going every day is the puzzle of it.
Like, how do we get through these monsters?
And I think they've revealed themselves so intensely now
that they can't hide behind actual changes
that you might think need to be made in society.
Like, they got everything they asked for, plus way more,
and now they're just going for socialism.
So, I still think it's the same as what I told you last time.
I think that there's just going to continuously be a giant cultural divide in America,
and I think that people are just going to keep moving towards the right.
That's why they're going to keep trying to import leftist votes.
Well, you're right.
And again, you read about times in history where groups of people
just do horribly evil things, and you think, how do they do that?
They just get wound up, and a lot of times it's a lenient, powerful system
or dynasty that liberalizes and empowers the average person
and then builds up people, but then the corrupt kind of sneak in
and they get control, and then we're tolerant of corruption,
and then the corruption isn't tolerant of us.
Yeah, and the corruption starts with the individual,
and I'm a big history guy, and you saw it with Rome,
where it starts with the individual that forgets about their nation
and their family and religion and right and wrong,
and they just start eating all day and stuffing their faces
and importing slaves and getting the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths.
Attila the Hunt, all these guys, they were already just coming in
because there wasn't good border security in Rome
because they just kept raising taxes.
It's a story as old as time, but I have faith that America will fight it
with what we have because we still are a Christian nation
and we just don't hear about it in the media.
That's the smartest thing the Left ever did,
is they put all the kids in debt from college
and they just took over the flow of information.
That's why a small amount of them can make everyone feel like the world's gone crazy,
but as a touring comic, I get to see that people are still good.
At least they're still fighting.
Now you're right, and what are they going to do if they lose the midterms,
which I think unless their election fraud is massive.
They're going to lose the midterms.
We have a group of Newt Gennrich saying that too, we're going to play too.
So what do they do at that point?
Just keep escalating because a liar never comes clean.
Someone like Hillary Clinton, you can see, and we've all known liars in our life,
like pathological liars, not a white lie that you feel bad about and come clean.
They only add to the lie and they will just add to the lie and add to the lie
until it just becomes just a crazy person in a corner.
And they don't have as much fundamental power in America as they think.
Our military, our police, all of our food, none of this is coming from leftists.
They have the wizard spells.
They're changing the definition of words.
And now they're up to rapists because I was called a Nazi and a white supremacist
and I was like, how is this possible to use such hyperbole?
This is insane. What words are left?
And now what's left is rapist.
They would call us pedophiles, but they hold that deer.
They think there's nothing wrong with that.
So now they're calling everybody a rapist.
They sound like they're on PCP.
Owen Benjamin, I want to play since we mentioned the clip of Kanye West
and then I've got some other clips since you bring them up that we're going to be getting to here.
But here's Kanye West sitting at some outdoor restaurant with the TMZ people.
And then there's the disrespect of this reporter.
No one even knows who he is.
Here's Kanye West, a trailblazer and a guy who sold over a billion dollars of records
and a guy that just supports bringing America together.
And then the disrespect, like they talking to him like he's a dog.
If I was sitting with some reporter and they said, take that hat off.
I tell them, listen, why don't you get your crap and get the hell out of here?
Just like Kanye said, I was bullied at Saturday Night Live and they cut most of his comedy pieces
and most of his music pieces.
They put comedy in over his music and basically cut him from the show
because he wouldn't submit to them and it's not even a scandal.
And then Kanye West comes out and he plugs Alex Jones and Donald Trump as matrix breakers.
Days later, they remove that from a whole bunch of newspapers.
Think of the coordination of corporate news working together to say, we don't want this.
Let's memory hold out of a bunch of newspapers.
That is unbelievable.
Yeah. And with Kanye, it's crazy because not only is he a massive star.
He's a clothing designer.
He's married to Kim Kardashian.
He's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
He also has incredible amounts of street cred in the black communities from Chicago.
His debut album, I think it was graduation.
He's rapping with metal in his mouth from an injury that just is falling out of his mouth in his first video.
He was called a genius in Jay-Z albums because he produced all that and they'll take it like that.
My picture is painted on the wall of the Hollywood improv.
I'm painted. An artist next to other great comedians painted me.
And like that, they can unperson you.
But the thing about actual alphas is it's okay.
We'll get mad or we'll get stressed.
But I think sometimes conflict can either break a man or it can hone you.
And someone like you, someone like me, someone like Kanye West, it's like Jordan Peterson's another great example.
Just some like a peeringly meek Canadian professor.
And they just thought they could hammer him and bully him and they just created a warrior out of that.
And we're seeing more and more of that where they don't realize that they can't break everybody.
And now you've got mainline professors calling for murdering Cabinon, murdering Congress, cutting their desticles off.
And the media is like big deal.
And then I say, Antivus, come into your house to kill you.
If you're a member of Congress, have your rifle ready by your bed.
They don't even quote me.
They just say, Jonestead, use rifles to kill the media.
Again, it's like they've just committed to pure lies.
Oh, yeah. Well, they're now in the pathological state.
And I've known people like this where, you know, whether it's somebody that's cheating on their girlfriend or boyfriend for a long period of time,
they get to a point when they could just be like, it's nighttime outside.
And I've known people my whole life like that to a degree where I learn how to deal with it.
And you can't engage.
It's almost like a crazy guy in the streets like, you know, my grandmother's in the orange juice on Mars.
Like you can't be like, no, she's not.
You literally just have to just grind past it and just hope that like shadows, they just keep going down.
You know, we have to fight.
We can't just do that, that whole conservative attitude where it's like they go low, we go high and ignore it and just keep giving up rights.
We're not doing that.
We got to fight.
But at the same time, the best move is just family, you know, America working hard, like achieving things like the things that make America great,
which is free speech, right to defend ourselves.
Like those are the things that we hold tight and keep hammering and just letting the dead wood burn off us by these psychopaths.
Oh, and Benjamin, thank you so much for joining us today.
I really appreciate the time.
It was an honor.
Honor, my friend.
You bet.
You bet.
And, you know, the good news is humanity is waking up.
People are getting out of this.
This transfer.
And there's so many people from TV and radio and smartphones or whatever, they just, they don't have any memory.
It's like they're conscious for like 10 seconds.
And I've learned freedom is having a memory.
Yes, it is context, context.
My mom hates digital watches.
She says you need to see where the, where the hands are and where they've been.
You know, it's like context is everything and not having moms in the home now is not letting.
Oh, let me tell you, I talked to people in 10 seconds later.
I don't remember a word I said, and it's scary.
You're like, I just talked to you.
And I talked to people today five times.
They remember none of it, none of it.
Hey, God bless you.

Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide is Alex Jones.
We're back live folks. Thank you for joining us.
Coming up, we've got a very, very important video that I guess I'll introduce at that time.
Dealing with the fact that Trump is going to investigate, just like I told you he was going to investigate Big Tech,
Trump is set to go after in a big way.
Not just Silicon Valley, but these big mega banks in Silicon Valley.
They're trying to set up a cashless society that penalized nationalists, conservatives, Christians.
You name it, they are all big threats to humanity.
He talked about that.
He's going to fight globalists and other threats to humanity in a speech he gave.
So we're going to be going over all of that and we're going to be airing the podcast clips from the story on a website called infowars.com.
Apple CEO denies colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones, even though he bragged about it at the time how they made the decision included.
I've never even had a conversation about this with any tech company.
So get your ducks in a row when you run the slave factories in China and how they all said that when you made the decision from your Sunday call and then they did it.
And then so it makes him feel powerful as a gulag owner. They always have this vice reporter that makes jokes about George Soros being a Nazi and her eyes are like super far apart.
And I'm sorry for her if she had fetal infant alcohol damage.
I'm serious.
It's what the globalists usually put some sad person who looks like they've got chromosomal damage on television to sit there with Tim Cook so he feels powerful in their presence.
So we're going to be looking at all of that too coming up here today.
You know, I'm living in the real world as everybody knows and I'm conscious and I have a memory.
And I almost sometimes think a memory is a curse.
You know, maybe that's why Christine Blasey Ford works in DARPA funded programs to help erase memories and plant falsehoods.
Maybe she thinks like that's her area of study because she wants to be happy like she thought.
I can go to New Zealand. I can erase who I am.
My students all hate me. I'm this huge liar.
My ex-boyfriends hate me. My ex-husband hates me.
You know, I'm running from myself.
But I've never got on airplanes because I'm so scared.
You know, it just goes to the complete culture of fraud.
So I shot a special report that's titled President Trump Set to Investigate Banks or President Trump is Preparing to Investigate Bank Discrimination.
Or President Trump is Set to Investigate Banks Discriminating Against Conservatives.
That was the headline when I shot it last night.
It was the headline this morning.
It was the headline an hour ago.
It was the headline 30 minutes ago.
It was the headline 10 minutes ago.
That's going to be the headline when we hear it here in a moment.
And it's important stuff to you and your family because revelations is a warning.
You might not want to let this happen.
You know, God lets us kind of choose our own adventure.
And I think a lot of these casual systems are in place.
Proposal will be filled.
But how bad it's going to be, I think is really up to us.
So we'll be back in 60 seconds.
We're going to air this piece.
It's very, very important.
And I suggest everybody pay attention to it.

It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones,
who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
To say things like that, the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign
against my campaign to influence voters in the election,
and then they began to weaponize them.
And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world,
like infowars, take out pieces, and began to say the most outrageous,
outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
He actually went on Jones' show and said,
your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
Waging war on corruption.
It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
Paypal is creating a global monopoly over online purchases and sales.
Imagine the abuse, the tyranny they can carry out if we don't say no to the system.
Do I think my lawsuit against them is going to save the world? No.
It's meant to raise an alarm to you, to we the people, and to the president,
who's already taken action against big tech of their censorship.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are the modern Paul Revere's.
We are raising the alarm, and we are winning when we take action.
Almost everybody overuses the Hitler Nazi analogies,
comparing things to contemporary developments in our society.
But Hitler went after his political opposition, Jews and many other groups,
and began to cut them out of banking, out of commerce,
and then out of being able to have shops on the streets.
That started in 1933, by 1937, he had put the Jews and other groups into ghettos.
And so about a week ago, Paypal said,
we've been with you 18 years, you've been with us 18 years.
You sell books, videos, t-shirts, supplements.
We're not saying you violated our terms of service.
We're saying for moral reasons, because you're a horrible person,
we're going to break off business with you.
So let me be crystal clear about why I filed this lawsuit in San Francisco in Paypal's backyard.
I did it to draw attention to what they're doing.
I did it because it's the right thing to do,
because we have major banking institutions in Google and Apple moving to China,
helping suppress their own population.
We have Google executives and Apple executives going public warning of this.
This is really a dangerous draconian system where this global cashless society
that surveils everything we do begins to persecute people for their political views
and deny them access to the marketplace.
It's very, very dangerous.
And I'm doing this because the law firms surrounding the president are part of the swamp,
and they're scared to do it.
But I'm not scared to do it.
We are seeing real bona fide authoritarianism here.
So that's my big message to big tech.
This isn't about Alex Jones.
It's not even about winning this lawsuit.
It's about drawing attention to what you're doing and making a stand.
We filed this lawsuit last night and already there's hundreds of articles.
Alex Jones sued Paypal after import was banned for hate and intolerance.
That's defamation on its face.
Even if I was a racist, I deserved to be able to have banking.
But I support Martin Luther King and the ideas of standing with people for their ideas
and what they produce and who they are, not what color they are.
Everyone knows that the KKK and the Nazis hate me.
So that defamation of them defining me as hate and intolerance
and blowing me out the political airlock so I can't even engage in commerce
is incredibly dangerous.
Here's another headline. Alex Jones' false lawsuit trying to force Paypal
to reinstate InfoWars account.
What we're doing is pointing out that after 18 years of doing business with us,
you are tipping to rape our rights to access to the free market
and defaming us at the same time with some nebulous term like hate.
Alex Jones sued Paypal.
Paypal sued over a block of Alex Jones InfoWars.
He goes on and on.
And there's a final article out of the Washington Post that says
how Alex Jones is poisoning the antitrust debate.
This was syndicated across the country today.
You have over 90 big tech companies all in San Francisco
banning me on every platform you can imagine, even LinkedIn,
saying I can't even say I'm available for hire.
Telling me to go to my ghetto and starve to death and die.
So let me give the arrogant SOBs at the big tech companies
who make trillions of dollars and are all tax exempt
and run the worst slave factories in China, in Google's case, or Apple's case.
You won't be so arrogant soon because humanity's waking up to what you've done.
The inventor of the Internet admits you're an authoritarian threat
and is developing systems to counter you.
You thought humanity had submitted to your tyranny.
We were asleep and now all you've done is awaken the spirit of humanity.
You've awakened her.
I'm not being censored because I'm stupid or goofy or fake news.
I'm being censored, like Tucker Carlson said, because I'm changing the world.
Thanks to our viewers and our listeners who are taking action.
Talk show host is Alex Jones.
He's a conspiracy theorist.
Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
Alex Jones.
His name is Alex Jones.
Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
Alex Jones is a nut job radio guy.
Talk show host Alex Jones.
A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder
if he really believes half of what he says.
I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
Hate speech. Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
1776 will come yet again if you try to take off fire arms.
I don't want that man to have a gun.
Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true.
Dane.
I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true.
You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S. government,
saying that they stage attacks.
They allow them to occur in the United States against U.S. citizens.
Let's declassify.
Alex Jones may sound crazy.
I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
That man threatened this country.
He is a conspiracy theorist.
Deeply, I think racist.
I just got called racist by MSNBC.
Considered legitimate on the crazy.
Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match.
Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop him.
I'd love to see that in uniform.
Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
I like that, guys.
That is the best.
We have gangsters running this country.
Criminals, gangsters.
The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
We have a fog that is descended on our entire nation.
The globalists are going to blow stuff out of the land on you.
Well, Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
Everything you've heard us talk about is now an un-old,
in-triplicate spade.
This is real as it is.
I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
To Matt, it's over for you.
They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
You're out of there.
You want it, baby?
You're about to get it.
We just meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant,
and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
Info wars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation,
blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution
out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women,
no, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us,
when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us,
when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.

Pointing what appears to be a water gun,
the image of President Donald Trump projected on a white bloater,
our teacher Pale Modi has now been seen
by countless viewers across the internet.
Yes, I have thought an awful lot
about blowing up the White House.
It's an actor dressed to look just like
President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin
holding the bloody, decapitated head of President Trump
are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
A rhetoric that has inspired the violence
has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
They're involved in the coup,
an active attempt to start a bloody, civil war.
All right, folks, so we're back live.
Old CEO of Apple that owns the worst
and runs the worst factories in China
and who pays zero global tax
and pays no tax in China.
Who's batted against America, but it's okay because he's gay.
See, he frances around, so it's okay.
Bloodthirsty, soulless vampire Tim Cook,
Apple's CEO denies colluding with tech giants
to ban Alex Jones.
I've never had any conversation about this
with any tech company.
He told that to the wall-eyed flounder
from the pro-petaphilia vice channel.
They have a bunch of shows on vice on HBO
about how great pedophilia is.
Just wait until they grab your kid out of the backyard.
It's really great there.
But Apple's CEO denies colluding with tech giants
to ban Alex Jones.
I've never had any conversation about this
with any tech company.
Well, really, I can pull up congressional hearings.
I can pull up the New York Times.
I can pull up the Washington Post.
I can pull up BuzzFeed just three weeks ago.
Tech giants meet in secret at Twitter
to discuss how to handle the midterms.
So there it is on screen for you right there.
And they're so proud of it.
And they all work in concert where Apple and Google
and Facebook, when they banned me,
they will all release giant articles
written days before on the exact minute.
AP Reuters, USA Today, BuzzFeed, all of it,
will all be at 447.
They all release the article.
Every time, it's at the same minute.
Maybe in the morning, maybe in the evening,
but it's all the same minute.
They all get together and they all come up with their story.
Racist evil Nazi demon that hates America.
You know, blah, blah, blah.
And then they release the fraud in unison.
Oh, but Tim Cook, he's never heard of this in his life.
And he was being interviewed by the...
Because these globalists love to have someone
that appears to be mentally deficient interviewing
and makes them feel more powerful.
That's like a deformed jester in the old days.
That's what they always do.
So they have this flounder that's been living
in a nuclear weapons reactor cooling tank interviewing him.
Apple CEO colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
I've never even had a conversation about this
when he tech company.
Oh, yes, in Google and Facebook and all you,
you don't censor anybody either.
Even though Apple admits they've given all your Apple IDs
to the Chinese communist government.
I mean, what a lying pig.
So the article's up on infowars.com.
Hey, great headline, Apple CEO denies.
How about Apple CEO lies through his teeth?
Says no colluding by tech giants.
Yeah, right.
Well, let's get that any trust lawsuits going
and let's get all your records.
Just like Google says, oh, we don't censor.
They just said the day after Hillary lost.
We're going to make sure this never happens again.
And it's in all the WikiLeaks.
What a monster.
So let's go ahead.
Tim Cook helps censor in China.
And Google helps censor in China.
Political dissidents, let's go ahead and hear him
sit there and tell you how much,
how much he's never colluded with anybody.
Here it is.
How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
Users want from us and what we've always provided them
is a curated platform.
We don't take a political stand.
We're not leaning one way or the other.
You can tell that from the stuff on the app store
and in podcasts, et cetera.
You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
But at what point were you like, OK, that's it.
Alex Jones has to go.
You know, we get into a singular kind of event,
but I think there's enough there
that reasonable people could agree
that if you're going to curate,
that that should be all.
Did you coordinate with other tech companies
to kick off Alex Jones?
No.
I've never even had a conversation about this
with any tech company.
Why not?
We make our decisions independently.
And I think that's important.
What a lion's sack of crap.
They admitted that they had their little Sunday meeting
and talked to other tech.
That came out in the news at the time
and that he led the charge to do that.
Oh, but he curates.
Kind of like Hitler was curating in England
or maybe the communists.
Stalin was curating in Russia.
You know, just curating.
Oh, you're just curating in China
with the worst factories over there
and the suicide nets and the forced drugging
and trying to replace humans with robots.
You're just curating when you defend the communist regime
that sells political dissidents organs.
Because you're the big, high and mighty Tim Cook.
You're not involved in anything political.
Oh, no.
Apple doesn't give almost all its money
to the Democratic Party and other socialist parties
around the world while your tax exempt
and big rich trillionaire pigs, your company.
You're a total versus signaling,
gigantic, galactic-sized fraud.
And you think you've defeated humanity,
but you haven't.
And you think by demonizing me,
you build the straw man for the first time
in order to take free speech
and then shut everybody else down,
but you have miserably failed.
Now they're trying to take away our processing
and I've sued PayPal over it.
And I didn't sue PayPal
because we need them as a process server
or as a group to process the orders.
I did it because they're going to move on
to all the others which they've done
and it's going to be a casual society like China
where if you're not a good little globalist,
you can't buy or sell.
So I did it for everybody to draw attention
to the president
which I know is getting ready to take action.
So that's what I did was to point out
what you're doing to conservatives and Christians
and others.
So they banned us on Apple.

You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
The Alex Jones Show
because there is a war on
for your mind.
I just went on during the break
and I said to Tommy,
I said, listen,
you need to talk about yourself,
because you can't get him to do it.
And if they made a movie
about Tommy Robinson,
because I remember hearing about him
like 12 years ago,
this guy exposing rape gangs,
English Defense League.
He's a racist.
He wasn't.
They brought in racists.
He left the league.
He works for the Sikhs and others.
You don't have Sikhs.
And I know the statistics.
One of the lowest crime rates in the world.
They got formed hundreds of years ago
because the Islamists was trying to kill them in India.
The Hindus, they're not doing anything.
I mean, okay, Hindus are kind of like Texans.
Maybe they don't pay their income tax,
but that's about it.
So, yeah, but, you know,
it's not even about the genetics.
A lot of these Arabs have similar genetics
to Sikhs or people in India.
It's the culture.
It's what Mohammed did.
Does that mean I want to have war with Islam?
No, but they've got 1.8 billion people.
They're about to be 3 billion middle of the next decade.
The globalists have made their bet on them
that they'll plan to repopulate Europe with Islamists.
And then we're supposed to just die
and give ourselves over.
So, Tommy, I want to get back into what's happening.
You've already proven it.
I know you just can't be stopped to warn about
the girls being raped and kidnapping
because you've got a bunch of children on them
and they've been threatened with ass attack.
You don't want to get into that.
But talk about just what you've been through
in like a five-minute gestalt.
How it began the year in prison,
taking your house,
the three months, losing all the weight,
then putting you by the mosque in the jail,
then throwing feces on you.
And then, again, now you've got a court date.
I don't know what you can get into on air.
I know the inside baseball.
They're wanting you to say certain things
and they might send you back.
So, I want you to be very careful here
because the world's listening.
They admire you.
They support you because you are the real deal.
But we need to focus on Tommy.
Tommy.
Tommy.
Tommy Robinson online.
Tommy Robinson.online.
Twitter.
For now, are they banning you there yet?
Tee, Robinson, New Era?
I'm gone, mate.
I'm banned off Twitter.
That's right.
So, we can't go there.
Where are the best places to contact you first?
Because everybody's getting first.
So, I've been here.
And then talk about yourself.
Talk about yourself.
So, from when I first started activism,
within the first six months,
my house and my parents' houses
were raided by the police three times.
This become a common thing
over the years that continues.
Go back to the town.
What you were witnessing.
So, we were holding demonstrations
and we were highlighting these issues.
Now, the same police force that just imprisoned me
outside the court case in Leeds.
When we first started,
I'd organized a demonstration in that police force.
South Yorkshire Police Force
is the police force that's come out
and been proven as hiding all of these problems.
Now, when I first come to their borough...
Did it turn out in a lot of departments
some of the leading cops are involved in the pimping?
Some of the leading cops were by the Muslim police officer
who was actually killed in an accident
who was part of it.
We've seen in this South Yorkshire area,
I organized a demonstration to come
and talk about these issues.
But at the time, these issues were not exposed.
And the police, as a result of that,
arrested me at the airport,
raided my wife's house with machine guns,
raided my mum and dad's house,
put me on full charges that meant
I couldn't associate with the organisation I formed,
but again, my bail conditions made sure
I couldn't enter their entire area.
So they prevented me from holding a demonstration,
they prevented me from talking about these issues.
Once the day had gone past of our demonstration,
they just dropped all the charges.
I actually have it from ten years ago
in black and white writing
from an independent police investigation
where I put in a complaint
that the police accepted what they'd done
was politically motivated.
They accepted the reason they'd done it
was to silence me.
And they sent their police officers on training courses.
So you were politically persecuted.
Fast forward to your year in prison,
your three months, and now what you're facing.
Because you may be thrown back in.
Yes, fast forward to...
So that has been a common theme over ten years.
If we get to the most recent case,
the most recent case, I went to
the city of Leeds.
In fact, I still have to be careful now
because there's still condition
on this case.
Basically, when I went there,
there's a court trial going on
involving 31 people.
Now,
all the information I'm about to tell you now,
which is the whole reason why
I'm still arguing my innocence,
all this information is in the public domain.
Now, when you read the law,
the law clearly states a judge
has no power to put
reporting restrictions on any information
that's already in the public domain.
Now, what we've witnessed on the last
six or seven big Muslim
rape trials,
that these reporting restrictions
are put in place at the very start.
And they state
that there can be no reporting on this
case whatsoever.
And so then,
if there was reporting,
then you'd be getting the details
of what the men said to the girls,
the comments they made,
and the horrific abuse that these children
have suffered.
Including even mainstream news admits
a lot of dead girls.
Yeah, plenty of dead girls.
Plenty of dead girls.
Plenty of girls who have never been found.
Their bodies have just never been found.
And let's be clear, we're hearing about Brett Kavanaugh
with no witnesses,
36 years ago, jumping on a girl at a party.
And the same scumbag
leftist media here covers up
all the crap going on here
against women. And again, I'm sick of people claiming
they care about women. I have a wife, I have three daughters.
I particularly care about
women as an instinctive level, and it enrages me
to watch the left
and their obsession with abusing women
and defending radical Islam.
Well, and their obsession
with the Me Too movement,
when I hear
so many comments about someone said something
sexist or a massive deal
made out of the fact that someone made a comment.
And I think
we've got children dying,
children missing,
being raped by their thousands
in every single town and city.
And you're silent.
And you're not just silent,
but you actually go out of your way.
Journalists in this country,
not one of them have challenged
these reporting restrictions.
So these restrictions are put in place,
so you can have a trial that lasts two months
and you will not hear anything.
And then when the trial finishes,
they'll lift the reporting restriction
and you'll get one day of news.
30 men have been convicted
for raping young girls.
That's it. You won't hear the details.
You won't hear the ins and outs
for every other...
Why does the left cover up for Islam
from Sweden to England to the US
and the mass raping and killing of women?
The whole thing of radical Islam
and its orthodoxy is enslaving women
and human. That's a fact.
Why is the left in love
with the true satanic patriarchy?
Well, many of the time,
as we've heard from the previous journalists
who knew this was happening,
Andrew Norfolk,
they only acted when he saw
that the far right or the working class
were making an issue out of it.
I think many journalists
despise us that much,
despise the working class that much,
despise their own country that much.
And it depends.
It depends on newspapers you look into
for where the money comes from.
If you look at the Daily Mirror,
we see the Saudi influence.
Sure, it's a sick form of cuckolding.
It's like funny. The working class
are getting their daughters sold into slavery by the Muslims.
Well, they're certainly not...
What they actually do there is they run stories
about how people are racist or extremist
when they march over it.
But now it's all come up.
Now that it's all coming out, what are they going to do?
Because they're on their heels.
They want to kill you, my friend.
You've got to stay alive.
Let me ask you this.
What are they going to do?
Because it does seem like
they're more and more on their heels.
Nationalists are getting voted in everywhere in Europe.
Common sense, life force,
self-preservation is coming back.
Well, I said this.
We had a day for freedom demonstration
two months before I was arrested.
And I asked that question.
What are they going to do?
Because they're now thinking
what are they going to do next?
Because, essentially,
I think I'm in the willing to see.
And I've said that because
everything I've tried to do for ten years
and I'd be willing to sacrifice my life
to bring the change that's needed.
Now, I think their intention
has been many times to let me be killed
or have me be killed
because that's the thing.
Now, if that happens,
after seeing the world response
in Britain and across the globe,
to my own...
Hold on, we've got to go to break. It's a heartbreak.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Come back with the incredible answer.
About a cliffhanger. This isn't Netflix.
It isn't movies. This is a real hero.
This is a guy they've tried to kill.
This is a guy tortured and prison repeatedly.
This is a guy that lost his house.
His wife and children facing asthma attacks.
This is a real man right here.
It's really hard to have the energy
to go to the gym or to go for a run
or go to the park or
heck, even take your dog for a walk.

and then hours in front of bright lights
every day.
But thanks to SuperMailVitality
at InfowarsStore.com,
I still have that energy.

Waging war on corruption.
It's Alex Jones coming to you live
on the front lines of the Infowar.
Waging war on corruption.
Imagine a Hollywood movie
where a guy 12 years ago
is running a tanning salon in a little town in England,
and sees 10, 12, 13-year-old girls
crying for mommy being put in cars.
And then he talks to the fathers and mothers.
They go, yeah, the police won't help us.
Our daughters are sold to sex slavery.
And then it comes out
nine, 10 years after he talks about it,
it's happening in every town.
And in many areas, the police are involved.
And it's just incredible.
So now, he's been put in prison
for a year because he exposed it.
They tried to kill him there.
And then in three months,
he lost his 30-something pounds.
Recap what you've gone through
and the fact that a superior court judge
said, and you're the expert
on English law, you've been through it,
you've got me wrong, said, okay,
you were convicted in one hour
of covering the pedophile gang, which again.
And then, so they struck that down,
but still it's got to be reheard.
And I don't know how much you're allowed to say on air.
You told me a lot of it yesterday
in that hour-long conversation we had.
Because people really care about you
and they want to know what's going on.
So, recap what happened to you
in the three months in,
and then the latest info coming up next week.
So, I went for a judge in Leeds
where I was reporting on this trial.
I was not
asked to plead guilty or not guilty.
I was refused the opportunity
to speak with my lawyers.
The case was not adjourned.
The judge didn't even tell me
what I'd done or said
and he sends me to prison.
And then, so it took them
a matter of hours to send me to prison,
but then it took me two months
to get back before a judge
to put across our case
to say this is not how
the British legal system should work.
Thankfully,
the highest court in the land,
the Court of Appeal, agreed
and they gave a scathing attack,
a scathing report
against the judge
where they said my sentence was unlawful.
They didn't think about it was unlawful.
Five major points were unlawful,
but the point is
they didn't have to retry me.
There's another case
of a gentleman called West
where one thing,
one of the illegalities that the judge
done on my case, he done five on my case.
There was one illegal thing
done in a gentleman called West's case
and his conviction was quashed
and there was no retry.
They've decided
to retry me
at the Old Bailey. Next Thursday
I go to court at the Old Bailey in London,
the most senior court of our land,
the court that deals with terrorism,
high profile murders
and I'm in court
for talking on my iPhone
about Muslim men
who are raping children.
That's why I'm in court.
The court case had finished.
I wasn't prejudiced in a trial
but it was clear other news
covered what you said and showed it
they didn't get in trouble.
You were being persecuted because you are a world leader.
Everything I said was in the public domain.
In fact,
if you look at what I said,
the contempt charge,
other journalists such as Rod Liddle
have been stopped on contempt
for breaching reporting restrictions.
He got a 4,000 pound fine.
I spoke to other journalists this week
who collapsed the trial.
There was 11 men on a murder trial
and he collapsed the trial due to his reporting
and he didn't face any charges.
We know you're being railroaded
so let's talk about what you're facing next week
and then what you're planning.
Next week I face
whether I walk into court
as I've been told
to apologize and plead guilty
so to meet the government halfway.
To meet them midway because at the minute
it looks embarrassing for them
because they've been proven that they're persecuting
and they've been proven that their previous trial
was unlawful and illegal.
So it's whether I walk into court and do that
and then I get to go home
or whether I walk in
which in fact I won't be doing anyway.
I will walk into court
with my head held up
and even if I walk out the front door there
and then my head's still held up
or if I go to prison
and I come out in a matter of months
or however long then I'll still walk out
with my head held up
and I'm happy with about all this.
Obviously I'm concerned and I'll be lying
if I said I wasn't worried.
I don't want to go back to prison.
It has an adverse effect on my whole family
not just me.
So let's be clear. Tommy Robinson, jail for exposing
pedophile rings and being a hero
and being proven right because he's dangerous.
What makes you tick?
I'm not looking to be put in prison or killed
or attacked or boycotted
but I know I'm right
and so when they attack me
the bad news comes in and suddenly I have like
five hours of incredible energy
and it reminds me of growing up in Dallas
when I was a nice sweet little kid
like a ten years old and bullies would beat me up
and I'd come home and I'd said
well you need to fight harder
and I was like eleven or twelve
I put one of the bullies in the hospital
next time he did and I ended up getting in trouble
but that got me out of here.
He said it's okay son we don't start fights
we finish them.
What makes you at a gut level
what tears the enemy?
I put a lot of things
if I ever begin to feel sorry
for myself I'll put things into perspective.
I just spent two and a half months
in prison on solitary confinement
away from my children
so yes that was not good
it hasn't been a good effect
but then I look at members
of the British public who sign up
for our armed forces or the American armed forces
and they leave their children
they kiss them goodbye
and they go on six month tours
so I just view everything
I may have been in jail
it may have been terrible
there wasn't bullets passing my head every day
That's it, this is a war for our own homelands
we are soldiers in the information war
and once we decide we're expendable
it doesn't mean we want to die, we love life
but we have to decide we are expendable
and I think once you cross that road
many years ago was it not empowering
when you made the decision
I'm going to go on to the end
it was empowering
I don't fear that
I don't fear that
and that's the truth
I generally don't fear that because I've accepted that
I've accepted that the
never welcome of this path
which I've chosen
I wrote a letter to my wife and I was in prison
explaining all of this to say that
I'm not in this position through anything other than choice
I know what I'm doing
I'm not a victim, I'm a target
I'm not their victim
and I'm not going to wallow in self pity
about a situation that
is nothing in comparison
to what many other people go through
Well these little girls, I mean any time
I get in the middle of the night and wake up and go
what are you doing, I think about how the globalists
are pedophiles and how they hurt children
and God's just saying do it, you claim you love me
execute this operation
Yeah, and the other thing
the other thing, the other judgment to make
all the time is are we morally right
and if I'm morally right
I'll do anything
I will go anywhere
and I will not face
or care about the consequences
of the problems I'm talking about
if I'm morally right
and once you go past that
as a moral compass, what we're doing
is trying to save the future
of our culture, our children
our country, our history
a thousand years of history in this land
that I'm sitting in and thousands
of men, if all I have to do
for five minutes is sit and think
about the previous generations
of what they get and what they sacrifice
and to be honest, even what I'm doing
is nothing
or what I've been through, is nothing
we are a generation of cowards
born in an era where
and I also take huge satisfaction
that so many people have been
brought off of the fence, they've watched
what happened, it's last arrest
I'd like to say a thank you
to Judge Marston who put me
in prison because he has
read more people than anyone
I've ever met, he's been the most
successful in bringing people to our courts
so that's all I base
on Alex, I'm sure with himself
we're right, we're telling the truth
it's a moral battle
it's a battle that we can't afford to lose
and the
consequences are really nothing
in comparison to what many people think
and now we need intelligence, we need to think
our steps out because you're a major general
in this fight, we're going to break two minutes
five minutes and we'll get back to your family
Tommy Robinson.online, people need to support him
he's trying to develop a plan, we're trying
to work with other folks to set up something so that
he can really get out there and be protected when he does it
and we'll be right back after break

I can't finance any of it

supplements, we have a lot of great things

were in some of the nastiest areas of the deep state
CIA
not the folks actually fighting in foreign lands
or battling communist china or the russians
or not people actually do work
but the ruling class brain bug
psychologist type
psychiatrist type
and pacenics one of those but he was the top one
and he was in combat so he's a good guy
and he'll tell you how horrible the whole analyst
you know cultural engineer crew is
they're the cancer
I want to be clear about different groups in intelligence agencies
these people are the worst
and
then we learn
oh the FBI agent that tested her
former agent gave her two questions
anybody can look up a standard
FBI profile test there's
generally twenty to fifty
warm up questions to get a reading
where do you live
where are you born
who's your husband who's your wife
what do you do what's your favorite color
she was given two questions period that's not
a lot of detective tests
like saying going to college one day is not
a bachelor's degree
going to college a month is not a master's
degree
so then her friend came
out was all over the news this morning
and said oh oh no
she never coached me on
polygraph like her old boyfriend said
who said she flew over the world
and was lying about being scared about in spaces or planes
which in her own
accounts she admits she traveled the whole
world she admitted that to congress but she can't
find a DC and none of the witnesses said they
saw what they saw
she said that's because they're sick it's okay
they're sick
yeah talk about
projection so christine
ford's friend and i's being helped on polygraph
fires back at news claims
but nowhere in ap or fox
does it tell you this
report blizzy
ford's best friend also career
fbi agent oh
you might want to mention that anna democrat
and all the rest
of it jamie white in full wars
dot com
so
it just gets
more and more ridiculous from here on out doesn't
him and a letter released from christine
blizzy ford's ex-boyfriend it was revealed
that ford helped lifelong
friend monica l mclean
pass the polygraph test
but who exactly is monica mclean
well she's the owner of the mcrib no
in addition to being ford's best friend mclean
also is 24 year employee
of the department of justice and fbi
from 92 to 2006
according to her linkedin profile
but none of the media wanted to point that out did they
no
and of course her lawyer
ford's lawyer is the top swamp lawyer
for mccabe and others the ex-boyfriend
describes ford's relationship with mclean in a letter
of tema fox news telling how she helped mclean
pass the polygraph test which they make the fbi do
all the time wonder why
he'd know that if the story wasn't true
wonder why you'd even have something like that
of course he's telling the truth
who would come up with that
that she had a friend help pass the polygraph
during some
of the time we were dating
dr ford lived with monica mclean
who understand to be her
lifelong best friend during that time
it was my understanding that mclean
was preparing
was interviewing for jobs
the fbi of the u.s. attorney's office
which is now confirmed
i witnessed dr ford
help mclean prepare
for political polygraph
potential polygraph exam dr ford explained
in detail what to expect
how polygraphs worked and helped mclean
become familiar with less nervous about the exam
you know right
dr ford was able to help
because of her background in psychology
very special background
now you think
her being a democrat swamp
creature would play into this
but oh no
no no no
so
so
it just gets more insane
and then meanwhile there's the article on
inforwars.com
of tim cook of apple
who runs the big slave factory in china
but it's okay he's gay
as long as he's gay it's okay
bragging about how they censored me
and just how i deserved it
i just deserved it
no one knows there's the body of evidence
like running slave factories
helping spoil the chinese people
like you a mass murderer tim cook by extension
words cannot describe how big
the stakes are for the future of humanity right now
inforwars
is being openly targeted by the democratic party
left to cia operatives
the corrupt justice department
and the entire soros crime syndicate
people say why would you start a fight with them
because they were already dominating
and running america into the ground
and we had no future if we didn't do this
so we've already had incredible success
but if you will simply realize
how epic this is
and understand how real this fight is
and why we've been made the main target
and if you financially support us
and if you spread the word about our articles
and videos inforwars.com
we won't just continue to stand up against
these brutal scompags
we'll win
we have huge sales at inforwars.com right now
and we're still able to operate
and stuff shipped out to you
despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce
and you're right to the market
but if you don't stand up and support us financially
soros the globe will spring when
this is inforwars darkish hour
music
well
at this point
there's just too much news to even cover
I've been forced to
file a lawsuit against PayPal
I have an 18 year relationship
with them
and
the reason I filed a suit against them
is to draw attention to what's happening
whatever comes from it
their contract
is toxic
you have your rights
you shouldn't make sharecroppers waive all their rights for a chance to
you'll be employed by them
music
and
they demonized me when they said I was a hate monger
and an evil person
when they banned me
so that's a form of defamation
and you know when you've got
them working with third world dictators
you've got them working with the nation of Islam
you've got them working with Hezbollah
you've got them working with care
and by the way
I'm not Lewis Farrakhan's enemy
and a lot of what Farrakhan says
is taken out of context and I've interviewed Farrakhan
at certain levels I think Farrakhan said some things that are true
a lot of things I disagree with
so I'm not calling for Farrakhan to be kicked off PayPal
it's that
anybody that knows
my show knows that I really like Martin Luther King
he was a great speaker
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr
and I really believe in
what you stand for and what you do
if you're great at art, if you write a great book
I'm going to read your book, if you cook great food I'm going to come to your restaurant
if you play great music I'm going to go listen to you
I think there's women
beautiful from every stripe of human
you know, community
and
so
that's where I stand
and I don't need to sit there and virtue signal all day
that I'm not a Nazi but let me tell you something
they've called reporters that work here
white nationalists
because they covered
Charlottesville
Charlottesville was led
by a bunch of Democrat operatives
all of them
who a year before had worked for Hillary or Obama
and then all suddenly dressed up like Nazis
and they're all a bunch of
let's just say it, I'm not going to guess them because they're gay
but they're a bunch of gay
drama students
and drama professors
who
you know
wanted to burn torches and go make Trump look bad
I mean that's what it was
it was just a gay drama club out there
dressed up like Nazis
and there's been so many cases of that
and then reporters go cover it and you get called white supremacists
and listen
I don't like white supremacists
but I don't like black supremacists, spanish supremacists
any of this. We've got videos on infowars.com
I haven't even gotten to today
with the incredible Millie Weaver and the amazing
Gavin Winsor shot
where there are Mexicans
who are illegal aliens, they say they are
wearing Mexico
soccer jerseys
like Trump F America
there's a new video out, we need to blip it
we should air it towards the end of this hour
just insanity
and then there's a guy who lost his daughter
when a drunk illegal alien
hit her going 100 miles an hour head on
with three of his own kids in the car
they didn't die, she did
and this racist
in my view, Hispanic lady, is saying f off
gringo
so yeah, if I was walking down the street
and I saw KKK everywhere, I'd be concerned
I walk around and I see large groups
of whites
trained to hate being white
and screaming white people need to have their balls chopped off
and kill Cabinon, kill the Republicans
you know, that's major professors
they're not getting in trouble, when you talk about KKK
K type crap, I'm seeing it
from white professors and leftists
radicalizing Hispanics and others
where you show up in Tennessee
at a Trump rally, maybe we should roll some of that
as B roll
headline, father who lost daughter confronts illegals
and he just looks at him
and he says, I lost my daughter and they're getting his face
there's a guy from Argentina
who's here legally, he's like Jesus, just be here legally
but again, ladies and gentlemen
that's what we've gotten to in this country
where Alex Jones rails against big tech
bombshell, PayPal bans info wars
after lobbying by Soros funded group
info wars falls emergency injunction against PayPal
and federal court
really wanted to show was their headlines
Alex Jones says PayPal
info wars banned for hate and intolerance
this magic word, I think Tim Cook
running slave factories in China is hating intolerance
I think them shutting down free speech is hating intolerance
but they just say these magic words
and I'm blown out the air lot
so they're the clear and present danger
what are we going to do about it
there's another article on info wars.com
if you pull it up
that's the latest
with folks that are so brainwashed
while they're inside this country
and so trained to hate this nation
that they don't even know what planet they're on
they want to get here as soon as they can
but they want to turn it into the third world nation
that they came from
why do they fear info wars?
because we talk about real issues
because we break down the real facts
I don't care how long it takes
I'm going to pull up the article on info wars.com
I tell you Fox Insider puts bugs on your phone man
once I went there it just keeps launching
all this crazy ass stuff
I'll set it for five hours
if you go to info wars.com
I'm just going to set it for hours
if you go to info wars.com
and you come there
and there's just a whole other article
by Millie Weaver right there
below the top stories in Featured
there it is
anti-Trump protesters declare Mexico first
and they've got Mexican flags
hanging on them
all this stuff
this is crazy town
and that's where all our reporters should be
is at the Trump rallies
that's where we should really be
Facebook and Twitter and YouTube
so that we can't communicate with you
so you can't see what the globalists have set up
and what the globalists have done
and what they've developed
and what they have set up in this nation
to bring us down
that's it
so I'm going to end this segment
and let Roger Stone take over
but man that's some powerful video
it might even make one of our shows today
it might even make it on the air today
probably not though
Millie Weaver is on fire
and I salute her and I thank her
and I really really appreciate her
so Roger's coming up
in just a moment
if you don't support us we're suing PayPal
that's going to be expensive
we're battling sorrows
and I'm not bitching how I'm here to kick their ass politically
but you might want to bet on the horse
and you might want to fund the operation
that's 110% in as hard as I can
because let me tell you something
a lot of people don't have memories anymore
their brains, the TV and culture
whatever mesmerization
they send through these damn phones doesn't work on me
it only pisses me off
so
I'm conscious, I'm aware
and I'm not going to let people that aid in the bed
mass murderers like Tim Cook run my life
and I believe we will beat this
sorry SOB and the rest of them
as long as you take action but I need your hopes
I need your prayers and I need your support
tomorrow's the last day
maybe even today I don't know I got new specials coming out
plus the great new tropic 40% off
secret 12 the amazing pure vitamin B12
HAPPIES the new mood
and stress relief system
with a bunch of key concentrated herbs that are known
to give you not a depressant but a smooth
calm confident
gait I should probably drink a whole bottle of this
actually don't do that folks take the
recommended amount and consult your physicians before you take it
it's a little tongue in cheek comment
and I'm pretty wound up with the energetic level
34 days out from this critical election
and just trying to get people out of
the commas
out of the trances even people think they're awake
are in these trances with no memory
I witness it constantly
just no memory even an hour before
and it's like a time warp but it's okay
those of us that have
memory it's a gift
from God
those of us that have consciousness it's an amazing thing

and then he'll take them to the wood shed like he's done
China that's how Trump works
it's through a process of giving people a chance
and I know that Roger Stone's got a lot on that a lot

find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
alkalinity and pH
what we learned was that there was in fact
unhealthy levels of heavy metals
and acidity in the rainwater
next we tested the water from our
Alexa pure gravity filter
and not only were the heavy metal levels
within safe measure but the pH
was also restored to optimal levels
as it turns out
the filter on the Alexa pure
raises the pH of the water
so what we've learned is that volcanic
ash and acid rain can contaminate
a rainwater supply
but more importantly a good water
filtration system will purify it.

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
live from the infowars.com studios
you're listening to the Alex Jones show
and now your host
Roger Stone
welcome back to the Alex Jones show
I'm Roger Stone and not even
technological difficulties
can stop us from bringing you
the real news
I'm in Washington D.C. today
for a series of meetings to talk about
grassroots activism
supporting the president's
supreme court nominee
and also to begin planning
to thwart what is clearly
coming down the pike
quite simply
if Brett Kavanaugh is rejected
you have seen the
dress rehearsal for the impeachment
of President Donald Trump
you have seen the two-party
duopoly's dry run
here's how it works
if the Democrats
win the House this November
a few short days from now
as soon as they take control
in January
they will surely vote articles
of impeachment against Donald Trump
because they are
empty-handed on the question
of Russian collusion
that is Russian
coordination collusion
conspiracy with the Trump campaign
their new excuse
will be sexual assault
by Donald Trump
as with Judge Kavanaugh
there is of course no evidence
or proof of that but there are
a number of women who surfaced
briefly in the 2016 campaign
with these accusations
none of whom had any
corroboration any evidence
any proof
that what they were saying was true
they quickly disappeared
but believe me folks
they'll be back
and now there's a new standard
the standard is guilty
until proven innocent
there will be a hysteria
created in the country
the president will be accused
by weeping women in the Senate
all of which of course will be
televised
and the president's
weak need Republicans
supporters will head
for the exits they will
vote with the Democrats
we need to move aggressively
but first let's examine
why this is happening
the last few days
have been revealing
between Bob Woodward's
book
op ed
and Obama's speech
you have evidence that the deep state
is preparing for the same exact type
of takedown that they use
to remove president John F. Kennedy
in his case
their game plan was somewhat more
violent
you see much like president Kennedy
Donald Trump
is for peace
he wants to lessen tensions
with North Korea
to lessen tensions
with the Russians
after the Bay of Pigs
Fiasco when president
John Kennedy refused
to mount an all-out assault
against Cuba and after
the Cuban missile crisis
in which JFK signaled
that he wanted talks with Russia
to lessen national
prospects for a nuclear
holocaust while it was
too much for the deep state
and they took him down
prior to these
more recent signals
the Washington Post
phony anonymous op ed
the Bob Woodward
book and Obama's incredible
speech in which he
grabbed credit for a surging
economy that he predicted would never
surge again
the evidence was
somewhat thinner but still
more troubling
you had a series of anonymous
leaks out of Obama's
intelligence services
regarding
the alleged collusion
with the Russians
one of these was even admitted to
under oath by FBI director
James Comey
then you had a series
of anti-Trump political messages
that were found in the
text of changes between Peter
Stroke and other FBI agents
regarding the fact
that they could find
no real evidence of Russian collusion
there was as Lisa Page said
no there
there and
then the Democratic Party
produced a dossier
not a document created
by law enforcement
or legitimate intelligence agencies
but a partisan document
that was then used
as the legal rationale
for the surveillance
of the Republican
candidate for president
an abuse of power
that makes Watergate look like
small potatoes
and then lastly very similar to Watergate
a former CIA
and FBI
operative
approached members
of the Trump campaign
in an effort to plant
faux evidence
of Russian collusion
these are the seeds
of sedition
these are the underlying
aspects
of the game in play
to remove our president
now there are two things
that the deep state
requires before they can make
their move on Donald Trump
first and foremost
is the complete silencing
of Infowars.com
they want Alex Jones
shut up and as quickly
as possible
because they know that millions of Americans
tune into Infowars
through whatever app
or whatever platform they choose
to get the truth
the raw I like to call it
stone cold truth about what's happening
in Washington
and what the globalists are really up to
then as I have said here many times
they would like to lock me up
having come up with
empty handed of any evidence
of Russian collusion
or WikiLeaks collaboration
or any involvement regarding
the acquisition or publication
of John Podesta's emails
now Robert Mueller
the hit man for the deep state
is out trying to fabricate some
other offense in order to silence me
don't let them do it folks
go to the Infowars.com site
right now because we need
your help as never before
Infowars is a beacon
of freedom we are
Freedom Command Central
this is where you will hear up to the minute reports
on exactly what the deep state
is up to in their efforts
to take down our president
we will tell you when and how
to act with grassroots activism
to counter the efforts
of the left
but we cannot do it without your
support and we cannot
do it while we are facing
the kind of censorship that
they hope to put on us
we are really
not crying wolf
we are operating under as you can
see some technological
restraints
but we do know this
shutting down Infowars is crucial
Tim Cook is lying
it is only through the process
of discovery
and lawsuits that we are going to
be able to prove
that the Apple CIO
lies through his teeth
when he says
there is no coordination
there has never been any discussions
regarding the censorship
of Alex Jones
he lies and only in a court of law
will we prove it

welcome back
I'm Roger Stone
pinch hitting for the Alex Jones show
and broadcasting from
a hotel room in Washington DC
where I'm here to
not only meet with activists
in preparation for the
deep states move on our president
which is surely coming
the Kavanaugh
assault is the
dry run for the establishment
it is their first attempt
to take down
a presidential nominee
and to delay
his supreme court appointment
in the hopes that they will gain control
of the US senate this November
and for
the president's attempt
to have a conservative majority
on the supreme court
now judge Brett Kavanaugh
was not my first choice
for this nomination in fact
I took to the airwaves right here
at InfoWars wrote an extensive
piece about why I was
concerned regarding his close
relationship with the Bush
crime family
and his role in the
cover-up of the death
of Vince Foster
the White House council
to Bill and Hillary Clinton
whose body was found in
the Park Virginia
I don't think Foster was murdered
by the Clintons I believe
he took his own life
but I'm virtually certain that the
Clintons particularly Mrs. Clinton
ordered that his body
be removed from the old
executive office building where I think he committed
suicide after
relentless verbal
abuse by the first lady
in an open White House
staff meeting, senior staff meeting
that would explain why
the FBI
Tech Toxicology
report
showed that his body was completely
covered by fiber
from a carpet
that's because they rolled him in a carpet
to remove him
and I was concerned about the role
that Brett Kavanaugh played
regarding a man named Patrick Knowlton
Knowlton was just an everyday
citizen who happened along
the park at the wrong time
saw men emerging from the woods
where they had dumped
the body of Vince Foster
and then made the mistake
of reporting that to the local
police
that brought Brett Kavanaugh
and the full force of the FBI
to his door
demanding that he change his memory
of what he had seen
and instructing him that he had seen
a car with Arkansas
plates there
at the park that in fact he hadn't seen
he had seen
a blue car with Arkansas plates
but as I recall it Foster's car
planted later at the park
was brown
all of that said I also said
that I would support whoever the president
nominated and I believe
that the charges
against Brett Kavanaugh
from all of these
various women are false
what's amazing to me
is that these same liberals
these so called feminists
continue to this day
to have no issue
with Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton is not only a
serial sexual assaulter
but he's also a rapist
who violently bit women through the
upper lip in order
to disable them
he bit Juanita Broderick
who has been very brave
in recent days speaking out
against her abuse
at the hands of Bill Clinton
and pointing out the hypocrisy
of those on the left
who
to this day refused
to criticize Clinton
for his abuse of women
but more precisely those feminists
who have no issue
with the fact that it was Hillary
Clinton who ran
the campaign to silence
Bill's victims
Hillary Clinton who hired
the heavy handed private detectives
and the mean lawyers
to threaten women like Juanita
Broderick and Kathleen
Willie and Paula Jones
and so many others
into silence
Hillary Clinton told us that she
was an advocate
for women when in fact
she was a terrorizer
of women
today I saw a video
of Hillary Clinton
attacking Bill's victims
calling Jennifer Flowers
who was
in a consensual relationship
with her husband
a failed cabaret singer
calling the whole issue
of Bill's abuse of women
Willie Horton
part two
nice try Hillary
you are busted
anybody who wants the facts
on the Clinton's war on women
can go to my book
the Clinton's war on women
it's available at the infowars.com
store now
this is the definitive
oppo dump on Bill and Hillary Clinton
the abusers of women
that the feminists who are raging
against Brett Kavanaugh
still refuse even today
to criticize
hypocrisy
thy name is liberal
senator Maisie Harono
an amazing interview
the other day where she said
men just need to shut up
and that it's time to step up
and block the appointment
of Brett Kavanaugh
based on no evidence
no corroboration and no proof
but where was Maisie Harono
when senior U.S.
senator Dan
in a way
the man who dominated
by a democratic machine
was a U.S. senator
and he was accused of sexual assault
by a woman named Lenore Kwok
a hairdresser
at that point senator Harono
was in her 12th
term in the Hawaii
house and do you know what she said
nothing
absolutely nothing
so Maisie
why didn't you
step up as you put it
perhaps you're the one
who should shut up
it is extraordinary
to see the
enormous hypocrisy of these
democrats
let's take for example Richard
Blumenfall
Blumenfall actually has
the Cajones to read
the latin translation
of the legal maxim
that if you are caught lying
about one thing it is reasonable
to assume that you are lying about everything
well senator Blumenfall
what about you're lying
about serving in the military
in Vietnam
when you never were anywhere near
Vietnam
you use this in every campaign
for public office you ran in
we still have no apology from you
we still have no acknowledgement
that you lied
are you really do you really have
the audacity
to accuse Brett Kavanaugh
of lying giving
your history as a
serial liar
yes that's Richard Blumenfall
he's a disgrace to those brave men
and women from the nutmeg state
who did serve their country
in Vietnam
yet he continues
his unrelenting attack
on Brett Kavanaugh
in the meantime
folks I want to commend Alex Jones
for having the courage to sue PayPal
it's really not
about the economics it's about
exposing exactly what's going on here
and before it's all over
I fear he's going to have to sue
Apple, Facebook
Twitter and all of these
social media platforms
that are so desperate
to end the clarion call
of what we do here at info wars
because you see it's only under oath
and in discovery that we can really
prove their insidious plot
that we can prove
that the Apple CEO Tim Cook
when he says he's never
discussed Alex Jones with anyone
is lying through his teeth
in the meantime
these lawsuits cost money
and therefore I ask you to go to the
