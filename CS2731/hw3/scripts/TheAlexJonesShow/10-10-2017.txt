I was told by our law enforcement sources that he shot several cops
and security personnel who just left at that
and I of course said there were shots going off before the main attack on the crowds
and you can clearly hear the shots going on 35-40 seconds before
a different cyclical rate and then the heavier gun go off right above Mandalay Bay
right where they say shots were coming from caught by the taxi driver
and there's countless videos of this
and why am I opening the broadcast up with this today
nine days after one of the worst terror attacks in our country's history
it's because they're doing two big things
they're having Newsweek take the lead on this information
while at the same time quietly letting the truth out
so that as more comes out they don't get burned too bad
they're running big headline articles in Newsweek
and a bunch of other places saying Alex Jones claims there was a second shooter
and here's his proof from Monday where you can hear the gun going off
it looks like a muzzle flash
but by the end of the day we found other videos it was a strobe light
and we said okay we were speculating there
we're trying to find out what really happened like everybody else is doing
that's totally normal
they ran it today
and a bunch of publications like I just said it this week
when I said it last week
this is just amazing how deceptive these people are
no wonder it's hard for folks to figure out what's going on
because I can't even keep track of their lies anymore
and then here's the big takeaway
they now come out and completely contradict their official story
and basically admit okay ISIS may be involved
Newsweek has an article now looking at it and maybe they are
remember we said that day one from our sources
but even bigger
Newsweek LA Times usual suspects
Las Vegas gunman shot security guard a full six minutes
before opening fire on concert goers police revealed
what have we been telling you what have witnesses said
they've said other people were shot guns were going on before
you've got casinos a mile away with a report and glass shot out shell casings
cops jumping on top of people saying get down everybody locked down
I mean this is all going on there's all sorts of gunfire
and they're not telling folks I guess they don't want to scare people
away from these tourist destinations or whatever
that this was an ISIS attack just like they do to casinos in the Middle East
just like they do in India to shopping districts and entertainment districts
I mean this goes on all the time in other parts of the world
you've got the Kenya attacks on shopping malls
over and over again this is what ISIS does this is what Al Qaeda does
and we have real sources now could the sources be lying to us absolutely
but they've been good sources so far these are real sources
the media is like Jones claims he has ballistics experts too but doesn't name him
oh like Craig Sawyer that led major teams and still team six
and is a top ballistics expert with national TV shows
and who's a top federal
expert witness that testifies in federal court
and a federal marshal
they just ignore when we have the sources on
and Craig can't get into all his sources he said no you're dead on the right track
but I can't tell you
but he says everybody's going the right direction
I mean they know folks they've been ordered to cover it up
and I think President Trump is wrong in doing this
now I may be proving wrong down the road stay with us
another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof bunker

I'm David Knight
so 10-11 days ago
on October 1st we told you
that our sources revealed to us that there were major ISIS connections to the Las Vegas shooter
now by Monday it became clear from our White House sources
that the national security apparatus has asked the president not to release this information
because ISIS was planning this attack with codes built into it
to trigger massive sleeper cell attacks across the United States
that we'd even been predicting would coincide with the Antifa uprisings
that are now beginning
we also reported that there were gunshots going off before the main attack
and that we were told police officers and security personnel were shot before and after
and so that we weren't being given the full story
and that there were other engagements around town
and now there's countless videos of folks huddling inside hotels saying
we've been told to get down their shell casings window shot out
and they're a mile away
and then everybody in the hotel gets their room free
there's video of all this
we've already played it
I'll probably play it again today
now Newsweek while simultaneously repeating everything media matters
puts out everything George Soros says
that the mouth of George Soros
the mouth of Chuck E. Schumer is Jimmy Kimmel
this is admitted
Newsweek is the mouth of Soros as well
and they've been putting out total disinformation saying
I'm saying the shooting didn't happen
saying that I'm saying O.J. Simpson was involved
never said that
they're basically claiming Batboy was found at the White House and I'm saying it
I'm not saying any of that
you know what I've really said
and they're scared of it
I mean last Tuesday they were attacking me saying
Jones says ISIS took responsibility
which they didn't
yes they did
now get ready for it
here they are covering their butts today
this is so huge
if ISIS was behind Las Vegas shooting there's a terrifying reason it won't prove it yet
and Newsweek's Tom O'Connor goes on to say
sleeper cells inside the U.S.
exactly what I told you on Monday
from the White House source
exactly what Paul Rotzen wrote about
exactly what Matt Drudge linked to
there it is
see
lead follower get out of the way Newsweek
now let me give you more
we told you people reported shots going on before the main barrages
plus we have the video
oh
LA Times
Las Vegas gunman shot security guard
a full six minutes before opening fire
on concert doors police reveal
I don't want to be this right
I don't want to be this on target
but the truth is they're trying to cover this up
and the sheriff has come out and done as much as he can
saying clearly there's no way this guy acted alone
he said that last Thursday
and they've said we're looking at radicalization
but we can't talk about the evidence yet but
looks like some people may have helped him
that's from what they found in the room okay
so
he could have been a patsy because the media acts like I'm changing stories
we don't know exactly what happened
we know so much we know the official stories collapse
we know so far it's collapsed
highlights everywhere we were right
but then yeah he could have been a gun runner
oh we told you he went to the Middle East first
we told you the girlfriend went there first
the live-in
we told you that there were hotel receipts first
4chan found them but we published them checked them
drug linked to it that was all pretty correct
we told you there was a woman in there days before
we told you that
she was there
earlier and that he was there three days earlier
all of that's been confirmed
the official story down the line
from top to bottom
up one side and down the other is not true
now I've seen certain characters out there
floating the idea that nobody got shot I've watched
45 minutes or more of different cell phone
and rescuer footage and EMT footage it's real
it's real there's plenty of splattered heads and splattered legs
and people say well some of them aren't splattered
I've shot wild hogs deer elk
you name it with high-powered rifles in the head
many times and it just goes in and a little bit of hole comes out
sometimes it blows the whole side of the head off
so these arguments that all these people aren't completely splattered
is pure malarkey
I shot one of those giant African antelopes
I forget the names of them
in the head and it just went in and went out
the thing kept going and then my son was with me
and pulled the trigger and hit it through one eye
and out the other no eyes and it kept going
that's how tough they are and there was like no holes
when we went over there
I don't mean to get into graphic hunting stuff
but the whole point is is that anybody that shot big pieces of meat
knows that ballistics do different things
and I've watched the footage there's plenty of splattered people
with heads all flayed out
it was real folks you can't copy the footage I saw
so we've caught them red-handed covering up multiple shooters
or at least them doing shooting at different times
ISIS connections all of it
it's all coming out in spades in triplicate
they don't even know what to do in MSM
and so their hope is to say nobody died
so the media can then pick up on that
and then get the families to come out
and get really upset on television
that's the plan
and I'm not going along with it so that's the way it is
I will not watch the footage again
and I will not show it
if you want to go find it online it's there
there's hours of it
I've only watched 45 minutes of it
and had nightmares
and because I have children and I have daughters especially
and I just don't like seeing young women dying
some of the footage is them dying, gulping
and you see their eyes go from clear and alive to dead
it's real, it's real, it's real
it's real, real, real, real, real, real
it's okay to question because they lied about babies and incubators
and they lied about WMDs, they lied about other massacres
it's happened before
and it's okay to question things
but once the evidence comes out
and it's incontrovertible
you know it's a diversion
they don't do big-staged events with 23,000 people
and then just have a bunch of shots go off
and then have some, oh quote, crisis actors
58 of them, 59 of them
no, ladies and gentlemen, you can't cover it up
at all the hospitals, you can't cover up something that big
you can't do it
so that's where I stand on that
but that itself is a diversion from what I just told you
Las Vegas gunman shot security guard
a full six minutes before opening fire on concert guards
they've been covering that up for 10 days
think about the magnitude of that
and that's a bunch of others
we've got countless videos of people with their old huddling
and they're saying, oh my god, there's glass
get out of here, show casings
so, ladies and gentlemen
they lied about when he checked in
we have all the proof they've not denied that now
they've been told to lie
and now they're saying, okay, it looks like
it may be ISIS in Newsweek
and that's because they know they're not going to be able to cover it up
because law enforcement isn't going along with it
and when it comes out
it's one of my main criticism of Trump now
that and saying he's against WikiLeaks
when WikiLeaks probably got him elected more than anybody
more than info wars in our audience
really, it's 50-50, but you know, Drudge, it's all in there
a constellation that brought Trump the win
of the populist resistance
but I get you don't want them and they tell you
Mr. President, there's a code
and they're going to launch ISIS attacks everywhere
wherever you air this
I don't buy that, that's the left
and the globalist inside the FBI
trying to get the truth from coming out
so they can score political points
just like they did for weeks and weeks
in Puerto Rico
blocking
the aid
getting there and the teamsters sitting on it
so they can have the biggest disaster possible
to blame America
it's the same crud
and I'm not going along with it
it's October ladies and gentlemen
November 5th, they claim they're launching their
communist uprising
this is the final countdown
how many days are we out now
how many days
how many days, 25 days
until they launch
Bolshevik Revolution Number 2
but this time it's America
and we're ready, dug in
and we will defeat them

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
well ladies and gentlemen
now news week
Associated Press and others are reporting
it might be an ISIS attack
after all
and then ISIS is sitting on top
to prove because they just want to embarrass
the establishment
that's a cover story folks
the point is
is that they're now having to admit that
oh the supposed shooter shot a security guard
six minutes before
the whole story
has blown up
in everybody's face
who pushed it
just watch as more unfolds
because it's
an adventure
all reality
that we're all living together
it's not a drill
and you live only once
this is the real deal
ladies and gentlemen
well
Mr. Weinstein is in a lot of trouble
and we're now learning
that the media
was only
putting out the sexual
harassment stories
because they knew a bigger
story was about to break
in the New Yorker magazine
and they knew this two weeks ago
so the same New York Times that spiked
the report
in
2004
and in 2008
and in 2012
that's all confirmed
the same
CNN that spiked it
the same Matt Damon
and other usual suspects
that went to bat for him and helped cover it up
because they're so liberal
told you I know folks behind the scenes
Matt Damon all those guys
it's a total joke the global warming all of it
they all listen to this show
by the way I can care less
and they all know what's really going on
but they're just totally
mercenary and stand
for nothing but themselves
they are the whores of the whores
all of them and it's all coming out
but as I and Cernovich
said here last week
why is all this breaking so big now
we said our gut is
the very media outlets that covered it up
like the New York Times are now breaking it
to minimize it
and make it about
simply hitting on women
and cheating on his wife
this in pedophile devil worship
central Hollywood
and the Clintons are still silent
but now we know
ladies and gentlemen
it's women saying he raped them
and that's what it's all about when you make women
come in and see you showering
and make it all about you
serious pervert behavior
it's trying to creep women out
and then forcing yourself on them
it's
cucking the women
so now the New Yorker magazine
from aggressive overtures to sexual assault
Harry Weinstein's accusers
tell their stories
and here's the deal
whether it's true or not and I tend to believe it
with the Hollywood slime types
it's all part of the same slime bucket
and it's what everybody wallowed into
so it's a bunch of vampires
eating each other
I mean there's some truth to
hey you know what you're getting into
when you go to Hollywood
it's like walking down the alley
in the worst part of town at midnight
and getting freaked out when you get mugged
but still the muggers are more to blame
they actually carried out the criminal act
now some of the young
16 year old girls that watch TV all day
think they're going to be movie stars
they go oh yeah come to California you're going to be movie stars
know what you're going to be is a crack whore
and when they're done using you up they're going to put you in a snuff film
for European consumption
they're going to torture you to death
because the truth is
the child porn stuff is just mid-level
the torture porn
the murder porn
well that's king in Hollywood
there were hundreds of VHS tapes
caught being shipped about
30 years ago out of Italy
it was a big national Italian television show
exposed it to Hollywood
and men were paying
$50,000 a piece for the VHS tapes
only
a few of them again sent out
of toddlers being raped
and then having their brains blown out afterwards
just thought you might want to know what these folks are into
so if you think hitting on
women at restaurants
and having a different girlfriend every day
is what this is all about thinking in
of course they're going after him
too full
to cover up the really big stuff
and to make it
about a men's war on women
and sell the west has a rape culture
when Islam doesn't
and created bigger war between the sexes
before they level their guns on
Trump
so everybody knows the left's hypocritical
and protecting the Clintons
that's why the smarter left is now turning
on the Clintons they're going to destroy the Clintons
they're going to destroy Weinstein
and then they're going to roll women out that say
Trump raped them and there'll be such a
furor and such a fury
that this will be the scandal
they believe will bring down Trump
it all crystallized this morning
I was reading all the news and looking at it
and watch it's going to happen
because I'm bright-eyed
bushy tailed
and I've already seen their playbooks before
and part of this is the chai comms
who are trying to buy up the
foreign Islamic owned
connections and control
Miramax's film studio
Weinstein wasn't playing
along but his brother wanted to do it, that's known
and so you just
take him off, take control of the company
have a big controversy
distract everybody from the stuff that was already
going to come out to begin with
and then turn it against
Trump and I
had already thought that this morning and then sure enough
I saw the headlines
from all the usual suspects in Hollywood
okay Weinstein's bad but
Trump's worse, he's an abuser
he's a rapist
and they always misrepresent what I've said
about this on the Joe Rogan podcast
even in my family court deal
they edited it and played a clip of where
we said it's terrible what Trump said
I wouldn't say it or do it
but it's not like you're jumping out of the bushes grabbing women
he's saying if a woman's climbing up on top of you
you can grab them
they're that aggressive
so it's uncouth, it's not a good thing for a father to do
we all agreed, Joe Rogan and myself any bravo
that was a five minute discussion
it was edited down to saying it's not rape
if a woman's already coming on to you
to grab them because they're grabbing you
I mean is it rape when a woman grabs you?
because if that's the case, man I've been raped a lot
a lot
no it's not, if it's consensual it's there
then if they say no don't do that
don't push it, it's still not good for a father
a married guy to do, it's wrong
but it's not rape
and then that turns into, oh Alex Jones is defending
Trump's rape
it's not rape
if you're on a
tour bus bragging to your buddy, man I'm so popular now
women throw themselves on me
you can do whatever you want
yeah, that's the whole point
and I don't like it
and that was Trump ten years ago, eleven years ago
and he's apologized for it
a lot, but most importantly he's delivered
on what he said he would do
politically to a great extent
Steven Bannon
and Info Wars and Drudge and all of us together
doing a great job trying to keep the Republicans
on the straight and narrow and we come back
we'll get into that in the big North Korean news
but
Bannon, myself, everybody are declaring war
Info War
on the Republic of Establishment
their numero uno enemy
they're the ones working with the Democrats
making the agenda to make America free and great again
they are target number one
the Democrats have pulled some briar patch
stuff where
they over give a little bit of money against the candidates
you know, we agree with Bannon
to take them out, that's to make conservatives
think Bannon's a Democrat
and to think, oh we better be against Bannon
because the Democrats have teamed up with him
that's total, please don't throw me in that
briar patch, that's exactly
what they want, so that's more shill operations
by them, we'll be back
and if the Democratic Party says army must be ready
for military options on North Korea
we learn more and more about what that

but make no mistake with this whole
Weinstein
debacle
now with women saying he raped him
and I have no doubt
guy's a pig
he wants to rape America
he's a globalist
he's proven what he's into
but know this
they're only doing it because they know
America isn't buying going after
Trump for any sexual stuff that's been
claiming to be illegal
Trump for any sexual stuff that's been
claimed because of the Clintons and the rest of it
and so I've seen major moves
where the establishment is getting ready to flush
the Clintons
but as soon as that's done they're coming for Trump
they realize that
Trump's approval rating
isn't just up six points the last two weeks
they have a
15% manipulation in how they do the polls
9 to 15 sometimes higher
and so Trump is 9 to 15 points
higher than what they're saying
Trump's closer to 60%
or higher as I keep explaining to everybody
just like I said
during the campaign and it came out
indeed Google knew, Facebook
knew, they've got algorithms
let me explain something
10 years ago it came out that major
travel websites
had cookies
that knew where you traveled and what you did
in an algorithm and so
you had to unload your cookies and I would tell folks
booking flights here
I'd say you notice that flight cost so much
unload your cookies, go in on a new browser
and they'd be like it's incredible
this flight was $2,000
now it's $800
first class would be $15,000
in England and I'd say
now go in
without the cookies
showing we've flown to England before and see what it is
it would be $4,000
this is an example
that had been in the news 10 years ago
it's not like I discovered that
it's far worse
I'll tell my wife if she's shopping on a big shopping cart
I go honey, did you back
out of your cookies, did you delete them
did you go in the fresh browser, she'll go no, no
I'll go watch this and every
time the products are
lower prices
and
I was just talking about this
talking about that this morning with some of the crew the only reason I bring it up
it's just it shows you
how digitally
it's the same to things are
and how people need to be aware of that
let me do a plug right now
since I
brought it up
when you go to infoarstore.com
the price is the price we announce on air
it's the same price you see on the
site we don't do stuff
like that
but you need to be aware of what other people do
folks like Walmart and Target
will raise the price of one thing one week
then they'll say 50% off the next week
and you're really getting what the regular
price was when I say
50% off it's 50%
off the regular price
at 1996
Brainforce are amazing
Neutropic for the mind
with all the known compounds that
boost your health productivity focus
in a healthy way
it has 4.6 of
5000 plus reviews unheard of
power reviews
it's really half off
at $39 it's $15
less than the leading competitor
it's already discounted now 20% more
so yes you don't just
support the very tip of the spear
you get high quality
products
infowarslife.com
infowarsstore.com
or triple 82533139
now I said I was going to
probably run this for a month because it sold out last time
and I said double the amount we order
and then I'm going to discount it even more
because we get a better price when we do that
and then people will buy more and then we can be more successful
and expand the operation they get better
products and like us more and it's symbiotic
I thought we'd have it for a month
and then I could trail off until more came in
a month after that at the regular price
we may have to stop it in a week
we're selling so much of it which is good
but we got to sell a lot of it to find the operation
so infowarslife.com get your Brainforce Plus
because I may have to end it in a couple of days
I'll probably end it for sure in a week
but I thought sales would start tapering off
it's just like insane
because it really is a good product and that's good
to even discount it more because then you'll try it
and really see how great it is
because other brain pills and stuff even if they say they're natural
they give me headaches you name it
we went through a lot of formulas before we decided on this one
you may like some other formulas better
because it's all kind of a person's taste
but listeners really love Brainforce
Brainforce Plus on 20% more
and we're doing it today
I said yesterday but I haven't got around to the new specials
Secret 12, Methylcobalamin
Biotin B12 taking sublingually
that's 40% off
Imrex Essentials on the household
product pack 50% off
that's a huge deal
on household toiletries and more they're totally organic
already discounted so discounted more it's unheard of
for limited time only oxy powder 25% off
that flushes out the intestines
introducing again the new
essential oils
massively discounted to the highest quality
it's all there Alexa Pure Pro
this is going to end today 20% off
Alexa Pure Breeze 20% off
that's going to end today
because I'm going to meet with Tim Perger
and I'm going to go with the new specials for tomorrow
but these have been unprecedented
and they end today
in FullWarsLife.com
and Caveman with a turmeric
and all the rest of it
it's amazing with the concentrated bone broth
that's got to end the next few days
and I don't want to sell out of it
we don't get more in for a month
so it'll go back to the regular price
starting tomorrow
if I have anything to do with it
because it's up to me to do
it's my fault so sometimes these specials extend out
because I have to move to the new ones
so infowarslife.com or
triple eight two five three three one three nine
and whatever you do realize our local affiliates
are king
spread the word about them
support their sponsors let them know you're supporting them
we have millions a year to try to get your guns
to try to bankrupt the economy
to try to sexualize your children
to try to demoralize this nation
and try to start a race war
so we are effectively
writing the narrative against the globalist
we're blowing their operations up worldwide
we are the tip of the spear
we're the guts, the blood, the glory
we are you
you are the info war
and when you financially support us it's very critical
and when you support local affiliates
the rest is critical
so please mark your calendar or whatever
tithe the local radio station
get high quality products, tithe to this show
is your local church fighting the globalist
did exposing the pedophile rings
did exposing the new world order
no they're scared because of 501c3
telling they can't be political
it's a load of unconstitutional malarkey
and trumps overturning it
but these churches want to play it safe right into hell
now a lot of them are good
and if they're good donate to them
I wouldn't give another red cent
to these name it and claim it glitter bug cults
I grew up in Dallas
in Rockwall folks right in the middle
of some of the biggest names out there
okay
and I know about these preachers behind the scenes
let me tell you
I've never seen hookers that look so good
so you just need to understand these people
got helicopters, they got cocaine
and they are partying
and they are
absolutely think you're a joke
okay
and that's a whole other area it's just these churches
these big giant mega churches are everywhere
everyone worships these stupid preachers
and they're not doing anything
to fight the world
government
the whole B system
these local radio stations fighting
and fighting for the trump agenda that is to free up the churches
and free up Christians
and not let the IRS persecute Christians
that's what's important
because we don't have the religious freedom
the internet censorship is coming down
it's not coming down on these little glitter bug churches
it's coming down on us
and they're going against our local radio station
sponsors but they can't stop
you committing today to donate
to your local affiliates today

that comes in here
we've got every bit of pedal to the metal
balls to the walls every bit of sail on
we are just
absolutely at ramming speed right now
because we know we're this close to beating the new world order
now I kind of ran it and I'm behind now
I'm going to get directly to Mattis
and the chilling new video about getting ready to strike North Korea
on the call before the storm
I'm going to get to the band in videos as well
and we've got the army intelligence officer that's been really on target

Dr. Group you developed Living Defense
for us it took you over a year to do it
why is this so good?
because people are actually waking up
to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
I mean I try to make sure
that I don't put toxins from food
and water and beverages in my system
but right now we're dealing with
massive parasites
which is anything that's harmful to your body
that gives off a host mechanism
right now with all the refugees
spreading disease around
we have biological warfare going on everywhere
these are all parasites
tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it
you have the neem in there
you have the organic clove bud
the organic wormwood
I recommend doing a parasite cleanse
at least twice a year
alright well I'm glad we've got some back in
because I'm going back on it today
it just came back in yesterday Living Defense
period
and you support the broadcast
infowarslives.com
thank you doctor group from the global healing center
you're listening to the Alex Jones show
escape from the new world order
and we're doing a pretty good job folks
as the spell they had over us
begins to break
well here it is from CNBC
NFL owners to consider
rule change that would require players
to stand for the national anthem
there's already a rule
but they want to act like they're doing something
total deception in that headline
but you know what that is
a big old fat
juicy
white flag
that they are running up in front of the world
after what three weeks ago
they chastised the president
and they said oh you say it's disrespectful
no you disrespect us
we are powerful
America is a powerful
NFL is
that's what they said
and now their ratings are down 35%
this year
I'm afraid 20 plus the last three years together
that's 55
juicies
it was 51 or 52%
just last week
but it slid more
so see
we're breaking Hollywood's back
we've broken CNN's back
we're breaking the ridiculous NFL's back
because now America's awake
and breaking with the enemy
everywhere now the new world order is admitted
everywhere I'm going to go to Bannon first in North Korea
now
all the things they denied
it's all out in the open now
and they don't know what to do
they don't know how to respond
so they're in full
panic mode we guys give me another video
unless I can't find it thank you
this is an amazing time to be alive
right now
it doesn't mean we're offering some utopia
doesn't mean what's going to come after this is going to be perfect
but the globalist parasites
they thought they set up a world government
in secret
and thought that there's no way
that anybody
could ever
stop them
and they could just sit there
and stonewall
the entire time
the hoax is over
the hoax is falling
they don't know what to do
and along comes Stephen Bannon
and says we're in a fight with the new world order
we're in a fight with globalist
and America's coming back
for the number one enemies the republican establishment
who's been saying that for years
and now we're that close to hauling them out
and everywhere we look
we're having victory
so let's start here
let's start here
with Bannon declares war
on republican establishment
and Hannity is all for it
see this is watching
our movement of Americana
go from being ridiculed and denied
to now taking over the republican party
vanquishing Hollywood
vanquishing the NFL
vanquishing
and Trump's just our front man
he falls the wayside or is killed
we're sad that happens
the taste of victory
nothing succeeds
like success
nothing gives victory like victory
the more you win
the more you win
that's why the enemy is always saying you don't have any power
you're nothing
telling you you're defeated to demoralize you
the ghost to the old republic
is rising again
the renaissance the electricity of human freedom
the burning in the hearts
and minds of men and women everywhere
here's Bannon
basic agenda that President Trump
ran on and won
he carried states the republicans
haven't carried in living memory
Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania
this agenda works
the American people voted for it
it's their responsibility by the way
McConnell would not be a majority leader
unless Trump in North Carolina
in Missouri in Wisconsin
incumbent upon them to back President Trump's
plan but you don't see it
what you saw what Corker said today
is what they talk about on Capitol Hill
that's when I left the White House remember I said
I'm going after the republican establishment
and we're going to go after them
but you're picking the rock solid
credential candidates
we're spending a ton of time with the grassroots organizations
to make sure that these candidates are fully vetted
you're going to see people announced this week
they're going to have experience in government
you're going to see some outsiders that are authentic
there's a beginning of the Tea Party
when things are first getting going
you're going to see real candidates and by the way
they're going to take on incumbents in every state
and they're going to take on the democrats after that
you said in a 60 minutes interview you're a street fighter
I'm a street fighter too
I noticed that
I'm not supporting any republican
incumbent that hasn't gotten their job done
not one Steve I refuse
they have betrayed the American people
they have betrayed their promises
how do you make a promise
that you have been in a half years and not fulfill it
it's a lack of sense of urgency
by the way these guys work three days a week
the American people now are working two jobs
now before I go back to Bannon
I'm going to play a Marsha Blackburn clip
she put out a video that got seen
last time I heard millions and millions of times
it was going completely viral
the same thing happens to our videos all the time
they get 20, 30 million
they just take them off Facebook
and a lot of times it's just Hillary
saying black people are predators
it's things they've done
they don't want the public to see
so Marsha Blackburn as you know was involved
exposing Planned Parenthood
the selling of baby parts that's a fact
she put out this viral video
got seen millions of times in one day
on Twitter and other platforms
and it got taken down off Twitter
other videos have been taken down off Facebook
I was mentioning what's happened to us
so this is what they're scared of
a nice clean cut good lady
with a good background standing up against
keeping babies alive selling their body parts
all the things we've talked about
so much and now it's in the Washington Post
Streisand effect in full effect
Twitter blocked the Congresswoman's
anti-abortion ad over baby body parts
but it allowed
identical tweet
so again they allow people
to say they're going to kill Trump and leave that up
but you put up a nice video
just showing crime statistics by Muslims
from the government
of Sweden and you have your account
deleted or your video deleted
this is what they're doing this is the censorship
and the fact is that they're taking on
congressional candidates
catapults her into the lead
it blows up in their face
people say they keep censoring us
I'm going to leave YouTube
and I go don't leave fight
show it's a fraud
show it's selective show it's discriminatory
and we're doing it
and we're winning
that's what it's all about
we're going to expose them
if we fight them when they censor
it'll go Streisand effect
and blow up in their face
and everybody knows what the Streisand effect is
it's like a decade ago
people were showing her big giant house
she tried to suppress it on the internet
so it made it the biggest story in the country
and that's what they've done
so let's go to the censored video
that Twitter and others don't want you to see
I fought
Planned Parenthood
God
I shoot Skeet
have a concealed carry permit for the gun
that I do pack in my purse
I believe our government
spends too much
grows too much
and is bankrupting our children's future
I believe
in President Trump's immigration ban
and I'll fight with him
every step of the way
to build that wall
I stand for
millions of honest Americans
who work hard
and they play by the rules
and I stand for the greatest country
the world has ever known
I stand
when the president walks in the room
and yes
I stand
when I hear the star-spangled banner
a great Tennessean
who wasn't so politically
correct himself once said
one man with courage
makes a majority
courage comes in both genders
and I'm running for the U.S. Senate
because
I'll fight every day
to make our Republican majority
act like one
too much is at stake
America needs a conservative
revolution and leaders
who are willing to fight in it
I'm Marcia Blackburn
that's why I'm running for the U.S. Senate
and I would be honored
to have your vote
so she comes off very credible
very mom-like, very smart, very strong
pretty
very well-dressed as she has a good background
and it just drove the leftist crazy
and they said we want this band
everybody else can have their ads out there
and everybody else errors them and you can see them
but you're not allowed to see something wholesome
and good and nice
that's what Twitter thinks
and so they're now going to find out
what happens when it blows up
in their face
and now leaked emails to tell
Twitter censorship of Marcia Blackburn's
pro-life beliefs
yes, insiders from inside Twitter
are sick of the censorship and they're going public
many of them are liberals but they're not
fascist authoritarians
who think you can just ban
speech in America because you don't like it
it's dangerous, I would ever ban the left speech
this is a real revolution folks
this is against the Republican establishment
by a populist movement
if the Democrats would have done this themselves
they would be in power right now
the people want major change
and it's coming and it's happening
and no amount of staged events
no amount of Manchurian candidates
no amount of race war funding is going to work
people want prosperity
and it's not that America is perfect
but they're overthrowing it to bring in globalism
that's why people are resisting it
once globalism is exposed
there's no way it's going to exist
it's going to be a system's tax exam
with diplomatic immunity
now the big North Korea threat and more

rules are being applied. Rule number one, power is not what you have, but what the enemy thinks
you have. Well, let's be clear that Antifa are not calling on the government to censor anyone.
In fact, that they they resist the notion of turning to the government or turning to the police,
who we've seen have been infiltrated by white supremacists who have been sympathetic to the
court sort of returned to law and order notion of fascism. And so the idea is the real enemies of
free speech are fascist. We've seen that historically. Number two, never go outside the expertise of
your people. What about when an Antifa member stabbed a police horse in the neck with a knife?
Was the horse a racist Trump supporter? Yes, so the horse. I didn't know a horse is to vote.
You see, the horse is a tool of the police and police under the Trump administration have been
increasingly intolerant, militarized. Number three, whenever possible, go outside the expertise of
the enemy. You are you are an easy person to display. I mean, no, I'm an easy person to target by
fascists. That's why this organization called Far Left Watch is going through my tweets, finding
tweets from three weeks back. And I don't know if you've gone through my Twitter. Number four,
make the enemy live up to its own book of rules. Number five, ridicule is man's most potent weapon.
As someone who has cops in my family, I'm offended by that because the people I know who are cops,
they have kids. Are they immortal? Number six, a good tactic is one your people enjoy. They'll
keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. Hey, my dear, dear friends,
no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA. Number seven, a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.
Don't become old news. Number eight, keep the pressure on, never let up. As blood is actually
reflected in Las Vegas's rising sun, she decides to manipulate the pain, the anger, and directed
toward lawful gun owners. She tweets, imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer,
which the NRA wants to make easier. Hillary, there's a reason you lost the election. As Americans
come together, you seek to divide, not sympathize, not empathize, showing just how hollow a tin man
you are. Number nine, the threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself. Number 10, the
major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure
upon the opposition. Number 11, if you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and
become a positive. Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public
sympathizes with the underdog. Every few minutes, somebody gets killed and a certain percentage
are black. Yeah, and nine out of 10 blacks are being killed by blacks. And these Soros handled
groups, their answer is banned guns. Always hear that, you know, the NRA is the new clan because
black people are getting shot in areas where they've banned the guns. Nine out of 10 blacks that are
shot in this country, look it up, are shot by other black people. Number 12, the price of a
successful attack is a constructive alternative. Never let the enemy score points because you're
caught without a solution to the problem. Number 13, pick the target, freeze it, personalize it,
and polarize it. White people, white people, not me, because you know what out there? In this,
in the premises of the university, I deal with microaggressions on a daily as do other people
of color. And you have people out there wearing hats like those, y'all don't say s**t about it.

Well, riding shotgun with us this hour is one of my great advisors that I consult
here live on air and sometimes privately about what he thinks. He's a former army intelligence
officer that came's highly recommended by smart folks currently in government. But also, I've
been having him on the show for a good 15 years. I was first reading some of his near future novels
20 years ago, really charting different scenarios of America taking back the country peacefully
or violently during a civil war in a fight against globalism. And so now we're beyond
near future. We are in the substantive future here and affecting the battle space of the
near future and medium term future as well. So we'll talk to James,
Leslie Rawls joining us. He also has one of the biggest survival blogs out there is the
survival blog.com. We're going to him in just a moment. But it is unbelievable that they've come
out in Newsweek with high level government counterterrorism experts saying, you better
watch out because it looks like ISIS might be involved in this. And then you've got other
articles with them changing the timeline saying, okay, he shot six, seven, eight minutes before a
security guard and other stuff went on. Folks, we've got the videos. I've had one of the former
leaders of SEAL Team Six, top ballistics guy in federal court, and he's a federal air marshal.
And it goes on and on. Craig Sawyer on, he's got TV shows on history and discovery channel
where he's a ballistics expert. And he says clearly there's two guns going off the first two and a
half minutes, which is what witnesses say. And it's down the road in another hotel where witnesses
said there was glass shell casings, people being shot. So there's a cover up. And the media is
trying to walk it back right now. And their new thing is to say that I said, nobody died there.
I've never said that. I watched the footage when it came out. I'm not watching it again.
But it's real people. It was really happened. It was very graphic. And as a father, I don't
like watching it because even though the girls were 16, 18 years old, I got a 13 year old
daughter and it just tears my guts out to watch them dying. Because there's video people dying.
And there's no faking that. There's not enough Academy Awards in the world to fake it.
You see that light go out of somebody's eyes while they're coughing blood up. It's not funny.
Now, there is so much going on on that front. And I've got sources that say they basically know
what's going on, but they can't talk to me now. They just put out the leads that
had ISIS connections, Middle East connections. He did go to the Middle East. We now learn.
We told you that last Monday. We told you first his girlfriend went.
We told you about the receipts and we told you about them there three days before
and a woman visiting folks. We broke it all. We broke it all. And by we broke it all,
we had a lot of the original first leads and then 4chan and the autistic army. And that's
what they call themselves. They call themselves autistic in a nice way, meaning they're so obsessed
with the knowledge that 4chan and the internet and Reddit, the Donald get half the credit.
And then the other researchers on the web and ensure info wars, but it's not about credit.
The media takes me on as the lead elephant to try to discredit me.
And then it tries to attach things to what I've said to cover up the real evidence.
So we're going to cover this now because James Wesley Rawls has been predicting that this is
all coming. The Antifa would quickly morph into a merger with Islamic groups and become
like the weathermen meets Islam, meets radical orthodox Islam. And at the bottom of the hour,
we'll do North Korea and Mattis, the culprits of the storm, saying that that the army must
have all options on the table and speaking to the army. That's coming up. But you've got,
I mean, here's Newsweek. If ISIS was behind the Las Vegas attack, there's a terrifying reason it
hasn't proven it. And they get into letting the government deny it and then showing it later
or and or they have sleeper cells that are going to be activated when they release the next video,
which is what we were told by our White House source. And we had that out and
drugs linked to that on Monday. So this is real folks. I mean, you know,
the media goes, Jones claims he has former Navy SEAL ballistics experts. They know Craig was
on stand that last week and they know our other sources are real. They know that they know full
well we gave the president the information on our Pio. He looks at Drudge all the time on his phone,
but he's more obsessed with the New York Times, which I think is silly. They don't have any
power left, but he looks at them a lot. He looks at Drudge a lot. He looks at info or some, but
mainly when he sees it on Drudge. And then some of his people give him info from info wars.
And sometimes I get phone calls, but he didn't know about our Pio because Hannity,
and he's got a lot on his plate, hadn't covered it. He watches Hannity every night or he takes it.
That's why you want to talk to the president. That's the most important show in America,
because he watches Sean Hannity. And I just give you the intel folks. They know that. And
I'm not gonna even, that's why they try to get Hannity off the air. They admit because that.
I mean, that's how surrounded the president is. So joining us is James Wesley Rawls. James,
how amazing is this that they're now changed the timeline and many were shooting earlier
here. Now saying, okay, ISIS connections. What do you think is going on here? Why do you think
it's being covered up? Or what's your intel suggestor? Pardon me? Oh, we have a problem
with Skype. It's just disconnected. Skype's a wonderful technology, but I tell you, James is
out in the boonies to say the least. So it's the next best thing to a string and 10 cans.
We'll get him in studio sometime. His face hasn't been seen in about 10 years. We'll get James
Wesley Rawls take on all of this as soon as we reconnect with him. And while we're waiting,
let's just go ahead and get into North Korea first. Here's the cryptic statement by the
president last week talking about the calm before the storm. And clearly he's talking about North
Korea, but also Iran's threatening preemptive strikes on US ships. So, you know, there's not
just our government out there that's got its problems. There's other bad governments. Okay.
Okay. And so North Korea is out of control. I'm not calling for strikes on them, but what if they
strike? And we've got to be in a strong posture here so that we can back them down and get some
detente going. A lot of folks criticizing Trump on being strong on North Korea, I think are
encouraging our enemies, quite frankly, because this is not the same old neocon government in my
view. But right now, let's go ahead and go to this clip. This is the calm before the storm in case
you missed it. Well, what's the storm? What storm is it? We have the world's great military people,
and I will tell you that. And thank you all for coming. Thank you. What storm, Mr. President? We'll find out.
Thank you, everybody. Now, the reason we play that is obviously it builds up to this. This is on
infowars.com. Raquel Phelan Mattis, Army must be ready for military options on North Korea. We've
got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our president can employ. Defense
Secretary said, and this was while he was addressing a meeting of the Army, the Association of the
United States Army Convention in Washington, D.C. Here it is. Unsurprisingly about Korea,
and I suspect you're probably not going to reveal to us the intricate details of your Korea strategy.
But what can the U.S. military do to lessen the likelihood of conflict on the Korean Peninsula?
Oh, what a great question. We'll talk about Korea for a minute because it's on all of our minds,
and you know there's a reason that I recommended TR Farinback's book that we all pull it out and
read it one more time. But, ladies and gentlemen, it is right now a diplomatically led economic
sanctioned buttressed effort to try to turn North Korea off this path. Now, what does the future
hold? Neither you nor I can say, so there's one thing the U.S. Army can do, and that is,
you have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our president
can employ if needed. We currently, we currently are in a diplomatically led effort,
and how many times have you seen the U.N. Security Council vote unanimously, now twice in a row,
to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea? And remember, the Security Council has countries
like France and Russia, China, the United States, you know who's on there, and all voted unanimously
on this. The international community has spoken, but that means the U.S. Army must stand ready.
And so if you're ready, that's your duty at this point in time, and I know the Army will always
do it duty. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having me. We'll be back. I mean, the fact is that
the U.N. is behind this, that shows you how belligerent North Korea has been. And again, I don't want war,
but this is serious. Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors
would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a
defense. Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had
drums of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet
war. Pathanogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter
this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs

James Losey Rolls is joining us via phone now, former Army intel officer,
bestsellingauthorsurvivalblog.com. What do you want to tackle first? Before you got cut off,
as you know, they've come out and changed the timeline. Said he was shooting before, shot a
security guard, now security analyst during Newsweek saying maybe it was ISIS. That's what I was
told by folks in the hostage rescue team. Let's just say surrounding it. I'm going to leave it at
that. I mean, those are real sources and everything they told me is now bearing out. I'm not going
to repeat the whole laundry list, but one of the Middle East's girlfriend, all of it, was radicalized.
They believe that he did have help. We broke all that first. Now it's coming out. What do you make
of that? Then we'll get into North Korea, anti-fundmore, James. Well, I have to agree that the change
in the timeline is significant and to try to piece together why he would have supposedly committed
suicide right in the middle of his shooting spree when he'd shot up less than half the ammunition
that he had there in the room. Yeah, they told me that the locals that have come out show that
there was, I could see, 18 of the 100-round surefire magazines sitting there in a pile,
a neat pile, ready to be loaded and fired. So what happened? Really odd. And to see the timeline
changed in terms of the reason of why he might have committed suicide, thinking that the room
was going to be rushed, that went away. So what triggered that? The other thing I wanted to mention
that's significant is the same thing I mentioned to Rob Do last week. And that is Stephen Paddock
was a private pilot. And as I'm sure you know, most people who get involved in general aviation
get aircraft on the brain. If he was a private pilot and he knew how to pilot light
aircraft, why wouldn't he simply do a landing gear up crash landing on that field full of 20,000
people? He probably couldn't have killed 200 or 300 people without even having a bomb on board
the aircraft. Conservatively landing gear up. Exactly. If he came in at full speed gear up,
he would just slice through probably 1,000 people. Yeah. So there's so many unanswered
questions here, so much conflicting information, unless or until the government releases the video
that Stephen Paddock supposedly was taking of himself doing the shooting, I'm going to be
completely incredulous. Well, again, just to show how good our sources are, they said no,
he was taken out by police. We know several got wounded. We now learn and that then the HRT was
behind them. But everything they told us is the truth so far. And so I guess I don't haven't
gotten more information since then. I guess they've been ordered to stand down or just not tell the
truth. I mean, this is amazing. Yeah, we're certainly being treated like mushrooms on this one.
They're keeping us in the dark and you know what, they're feeding us. So we just need to be
forward-leaning on this. We need to push our elected representatives and push the folks
in the law enforcement community to get the information out there, the real truth of what
happened out. And I suspect that we're going to find that he did have connections to ISIS,
firm connections. And this really should be labeled an act of radical Islamic terrorism.
What do you make of Newsweek saying, okay, it might be ISIS? I mean, they're kind of walked
back now their claims that was preposterous. Why would the FBI within hours of the event and ISIS
taking responsibility rule them out when they never do that before? And generally even AP admits
ISIS normally only takes credit for what they've done. Right. I think it was incredibly irresponsible
of the FBI at the very least and probably nefarious of them to rule out an ISIS connection.
I don't see how they had the evidence in hand that early on to make that kind of call. I don't
think they could. We're still waiting for some substantive information to come out and I wouldn't
be surprised if it comes out of either the intelligence community or high-level law enforcement
telling us exactly what the connection between Stephen Paddock and ISIS was. Now, granted,
his wife was from the northern Philippines and I don't know whether or not she had an Islamic
background or not. But even in the absence of that, anyone who's had contact with Islamic
recruitment videos could have conceivably become a convert to Islam and become an ISIS sympathizer
or an ISIS shock troop. Well, look, law enforcement told us connections traveling the Middle East,
all of it before that was in the news. That was proof right there what they gave us.
And now it's all starting to come out. But just like Benghazi, I don't think they're going to
be able to cover this up. I know from a White House source why Trump has basically sat on this
because they're telling him we're not sure still yet. But sir, if it is ISIS, we think there's
codes in the attack that may launch a larger attack because they know Trump is into military
secrecy and not telling folks what you know. So they're kind of using that against the president
so that some of the deep state Democrats can make this about gun control instead of validating the
president about the danger of the Islamic invasion. And ISIS saying, as you know, the last few years,
their main push is getting white Westerners who can blend in to carry out the attacks. That's what
they've said they've been targeting. Their next big push has been that. Yes, and that's quite
believable. Now, if Trump is holding back with holding information that he has, it may be very
well be because folks in the intelligence community or in the Pentagon may have told them,
may have told him that they have some sort of counter strike plan or that there or there might
be a sources and methods issue with releasing information. I wouldn't be surprised at all
if folks in the NSA had some intercepts that point that connected Stephen Paddock to ISIS.
But because of the sensitivity of forces and methods, that can't be released publicly. That's
just like in World War Two, the British for four years of the war had enigma, had the code, but
a lot of times had to let submarines sink the fleets, had to let them do it because they only
needed it for those critical times to win the war. Yeah, it very well could be an upset issue like
that. Wow. Amazing. Just to see this unfolding. What does your gut tell you just looking at the
whole thing? Well, my gut tells me that, A, there was more than one person involved.
The hotel records alone point to that. B, there could be a ISIS connection. And C, I think that
Stephen Paddock was either a mind control subject or manipulated by possibly a FBI team
infiltration where they may have orchestrated some of these events just like they did the
first bombing at the war. Stay there. This is so important. I want you to flesh this out because
I know you're an expert on this. Again, James Leslie Rawls, survivalblog.com, amazing info,
because he would lay in bed for hours screaming, screaming, not knowing who he was according to
his girlfriend and more. He had a lot of, his brother looks like a mind control head. Let's talk
about this straight ahead. December 23, 1776. These are the times that try men's souls. The
summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their
country. But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny,
like hell, is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the
conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is
dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its
goods. And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be
highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right,
not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever. And if being bound in that matter
is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious,
for so unlimited a power can only belong to God. Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.

Now when I say there are dozens of videos, I've probably watched, I don't want to exaggerate,
close to a hundred. I've watched more than 10 videos shot of the people dead and dying
during the shooting and after in the first few minutes, but I thought hey let's show you some
of the new videos people are pointing out. I mean they were shot the day of the event live,
but as folks, citizen researchers dig through this, they're finding more and more videos that show
the exact same rate of fire, the exact same things we hear from different areas. We do have a leading
national acoustics expert who is doing modeling right now and it's pointing towards multiple
shooters and it's pointing towards, but he's still researching it. Not being a bump stock,
they're able with acoustic signatures to even tell you what firearms they are and I can tell you
there's a heavier machine gun, not a crank that's on a belt and that's what all the guys that are
experts Navy SEALs and Army people, Green Berets and others have told us that they've been saying
the same thing since the day it happened. I called all the Green Berets and military guys and special
ops people, I called a bunch of them and they all said the same thing and now it's coming out. So
let me play this new video. Let's put it on screen so I can plug the YouTube channel that has this
people can go see the full video. That's the alternative news and info report as you can see
that went up on October 9th. This is just one of the new ones I hadn't seen. Again it's from the day,
but they've got it and put it on their channel. New video services proves multiple shooters in Vegas
and this fits into all the other videos just from a different angle, a different area. So let's go
ahead and roll some of this footage. Now let's stop right there. I'm going to play that for
James Rosey Rolls. Now let's play the cab driver footage shot right under the window in the parking
lawn at Mandalay and you can hear it far off distant. Sounds like it's close to a mile away,
a different firearm. And then you hear something that sounds like an M4 AR-15
you know that's closer together right above ladies and gentlemen. And it's all happening
the first two and a half minutes. There's only one gun going off or one person shooting at a time
after that, but in the first two and a half minutes here it is.
That sounds like it's coming from farther away.
I notice she's in the same position when it goes off and it's 10 times louder.
Then she moves and it's still loud. People say oh is she drove away? No, she's still in the same
spot when you hear it being a lot louder and right above. That's where the reported shooting
was coming from. So that is powerful. James Wesley Rolls. Alex, I think you're right. There's
three distinct sound signatures there. One is an echo, but the other, the very first shooting you
heard was shooting from in the distance and then you had shooting from up close and the
cyclic rate sounded like it was right around 600 rounds a minute and that could have been an M4
with a long magazine and with a heavy buffer to slow the cyclic rate down, but to me that sounded
like an M249, which is a belt fed. I have serious doubts that we're getting the whole story about
what happened that night about how many people were shooting and where all the shooting was
originating. There's some information that came out in the last couple of days about shooting
that took place in the front lobby of the Bellagio Hotel. Yes, we've got witnesses all saying
casings, glass, please saying get in. It's very compelling. Right, so we definitely have at least
two different locations where they were shooting going on and we're definitely not getting the
whole story. I really want to have folks dig into this forensically and see what happened.
And to get back to our previous subject on possible mind control or infiltration by
either government informants. You were getting into case points where they
find a mentally ill person, wind them up, control them, and they believe they're being
handled by a foreign power, but they're being handled by the FBI. I mean even the New York Times
had mentioned that the FBI, one out of a hundred terror plots, hatched 98 of them.
Right, we very well could have a situation where Stephen Paddock might have even been
in a situation like in the fictional movie Conspiracy Theory where they
had an individual who was mentally imbalanced and in a delicate state and convinced him that
he's actually helping the government when he's actually being used as a patsy, as a fall guy.
And it very well could have been orchestrated by means of contacts away from his home where
even if Mary Lou Danly, his girlfriend, were to testify, she wouldn't have a thing to say
because I think if you look at his travel pattern, which was amazing for a guy who
was supposedly a professional gambler, he was bouncing around between Southern Nevada, Texas,
and Northern Arizona on a regular basis. And that would have given plenty of opportunity
for him to be touching base with a FBI handler or say-
His MO fits a gun runner or narcotics trafficker who's being controlled fast and furious style,
who's laundering millions of dollars every quarter through these things, but that he was
just the useful idiot bag man being used to do it, paying for everything, his family,
his brother's now being investigated for narcotics trafficking. I mean you've got this
whole, and then the hotel lying about him getting there, you know, three days later,
and the receipts, I mean what does all that say? Yeah, and I have never heard of a professional
gambler that plays video poker because it's not like a live poker game where you can watch the
dealer and the dealing- No, it's programmed where you lose 65% of the time.
Right, so how do you, you're not going to make up for that on volume.
I think he was there to launder money, and he had to spend all those hours in the casino
and do that volume of gambling to cover the amount of money that had to-
Sure, I mean look, his dad's a famous bank robber, a psychopath that tried to run a
revpie agent. The whole family's been handled, it's coming out, the brothers are basically
snitches. I mean this guy's the classic cut out snitch that thought he was a tough guy,
told women he was a secret agent, told women he was a psychopath, when what he really was was
just some cut out decoy slime bag. I think he very well may be right that we are not being
told the whole story about Stephen Paddock, what his motivations were, who was controlling him,
and what he thought he was doing. It could have been either a false flag or a third flag operation,
and I'm sure a lot of your listeners are familiar with the term third flag, but typically like in
in the case of a famous American spy named Pollock.
Hold on, stay there. Let's come back and finish up with different types of false flags, third flags,
different double crosses, triple agents, quadruple agents, all sorts of decoy operations. Let's talk
about that on the other side, then get into the big enchilada, North Korea with our guest James Wesley
Rawls, and now admit a possible strike on North Korea is the talk of the calm before the storm,

from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm your host Alex Jones. Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com are our new sites
in the next hour and have open phones and I'm going to cover all the other big breaking news on
the economy. You name it James Wesley Rawls and survivalblog.com former army intel officer best
selling author is our guest but let's play that clip just one more of this video showing the same
thing from Sunday night where you can as he said hear faraway shooting close shooting and then
there's echoes and bullets bouncing around the middle of it if you want to slow it down but
but I mean it's just totally clear and of course the video I played earlier is even clear but here
it is right there you can hear overlapping fire that's clearly two different rifles two different
cadences crossing over each other just spectacularly obvious James Wesley Rawls continuing
with what a triple flag is okay a third flag operation is where an individual is led to
believe that they will be infiltrating an organization in their country on behalf of
another country and I mentioned Jonathan Pollard he was a CIA analyst who became a intelligence
asset for the government of Israel back in the 1980s and he was eventually released I think
in around 2015 but a lot of times people will be brought into intelligence operations and led to
believe that they're going to be representing a third country that say for example Stephen
Patek was told that he would either be representing the United States government or another friendly
pro-western government to infiltrate ISIS on behalf as an operative but in fact he was being
played where this wasn't a uh and a Reichstag style operation where they wanted to actually
have a terrorist incident take place that they could blame on another another country
or just to be clear I kind of fumbled the term but I've read about third flags going back hundreds
of years ago different governments in wars between Spain and England doing it when these
terms first got developed of false flag third flag and they had a whole bunch of other terms just
like they have for you know picking up sea garbage flotsam jetsam it just goes on and on all these
weird naval terms that these come from but when I call it triple flag isn't this kind of a term
that is there a triple cross where again you think you're doing one thing working for another
group but it's really another group and you're being set up as a decoy basically right it's
conceivable that um that there was a foreign intelligence agency or a terrorist group that
made it look like uh he was was operating on behalf of the United States government
and you know basically doing a good service for his own country sure that's easy to do I mean
that's the whole plot of the movie sniper uh that came out a few years ago that's a very powerful
film have have you seen that with Mark Wahlberg yes I have and then that that is a a good um
comparison that that's a comparable situation that's a third flag happened that's a third flag
that's a third flag operation right he's told he's getting ready to address dangers of the
president and his security so see if you can get into sniper position see if you can carry this
attack out and then really they just intend to have him doing a drill where they end up killing him
and then making it look like he did it right and another another third flag would be Arlington
road Arlington road where that the professor thinks he's going to stop the bombing but they
actually set him up right right and in the case of Stephen Paddock there was almost an hour that
went by between the time the shooting started out on the at least the firing from the building
down to the to the um to the concert below there was almost an hour that went by so
the coroner is not going to be able to determine exactly when he was killed or whether he killed
himself so there may have been someone else doing all of the shooting by the same what does it
signify the first shots were ever fired what does it signify that my sources that have proven
accurate so far the only part that hasn't been proven now that they told me was that indeed
he was shot by the police uh did not commit suicide well that wouldn't surprise me at all
because again at the time he stopped shooting he still had a number of weapons that had never
been fired so even if he was having mechanical problems with the weapons he was shooting um
there was a number of weapons that had never been fired there were stacks of loaded magazines still
sitting there neatly stacked ready to be fired and without anyone bursting through the doors
what what was his reason for then suddenly did he have some sudden change of heart where he
wanted to kill himself it just doesn't it doesn't match and well we now know we've been we've been
saying that James and now we know the whole official story is unraveling and and first we
had the sheriff going he had to have help and we're looking at radicalization and then they
kind of pulled back from that and now their narrative is unraveling what do you think's
going on i think we've got patriot leakers that they're having to get out of head up because
they know people are pissed off and about to release more well certainly their initial
narrative about the timeline of when the hotel security guard came to the door um they had to
change that because that that completely unraveled on them but unfortunately that took away the
convenient reason for steven paddock to have committed suicide which was he was in fear that
he that he was in imminent danger of having the room rushed by a swat team so i think we're being
fed a lot of lies here and the truth will come out the truth will prevail because we live in the
internet age we live in the age of ubiquitous cell phones with cameras built of ubiquitous
humid there's so many people documenting everything that big brother's now been turned against big
brother right and and you'll if you notice on youtube there are now videos being released
that synchronize three four or five videos um together based on the firing pattern and it's
lining up yeah they're they're syncing all these up so it's like having multiple human assets on
the ground at multiple locations you can't lie yourself around a situation like that but the
truth will come out well my sources are real tight lip now and i'm surprised they even gave us what
we got risking their lives undoubtedly but they just say it's complete bs and the guy was isis
antifa and that there were other about other shooters and that he was going to the middle east
and now it's all starting to come out so now they're all completely silent and my other sources
just say look you're on target we can't tell you alex but you're on target yeah i think that as time
goes on more and more information is going to come out and there's one other really interesting
tidbit that you probably already mentioned on your show and that is an airplane that he previously
owned ended up being sold to an intelligence defense contractor in shantilly virginia i saw
that but i didn't ever cover it stay there and do five more minutes with us i want to get into
north korea with you just a briefly on the side of this break uh just amazing to have james wasley
rolls here and i'm just jumping in a lot not to interrupt but just we're adding info to each other
and just really building this picture because there's so much i haven't even gotten into i mean it's
just crazy what a cover-up it is but i don't plan to be breaking all this we're just looking at what
humanity is discovering covering it but it locks in with what the fbi hostage rescue team folks told
us uh and from what other sources said so this is just to be this right it's just to see you and
your own research listeners be so right compared to msm's lies and then have newsweek having to admit
okay maybe isis did do it i mean this is getting crazy and you're seeing the cratering of their
credibility go to survivalblog.com you'll find his great bugs james wasley rolls and more be sure

they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just

you're listening to the alex jones show
from the front lines snow brag it's just fact
from the front line you just gotta be willing to die formation war to live it's alex jones
nobody else is not willing to fight to their slaves but now we see the new world order going
on to the rocks it's bad for business james leslie ralls north korea the calm before the storm
speech now i'm confirmed to be a threat to north korea uh is this all just saber rattling uh i don't
want a war i love my four children at the same time i know north korea is evil it's not like these
middle eastern wars this is a real threat given weapons by the globalist trump appears to be cleaning
up the globalist mess in the middle east and now this but i don't want to strike but he does get
more belligerent how they even get the u.n and others on board uh for the u.s to basically stand
up north korea what do you make of this situation well alex i think that you're right that most of
it is saber rattling uh the the threat of an actual shooting war with north korea is relatively
small but the implications of that happening are huge because north korea is now a nuclear armed power
so we the threat there is credible um a lot of it though is grandstanding and saber rattling
for the sake of uh consolidating power uh in the united nations and um backing up the longstanding
american position in the region you know a lot of your listeners may not realize but
peace was really not ever declared in on the korean yeah the war is still going on it's
it's like this is fine the state of war in existence it's just as there's just simply
been a ceasefire since the early 50s so um yes that very well uh could uh re-erupt and it could be
very ugly when it does if nukes start getting bobbed around my real doubts about the situation
involve north korean technology obviously they have fission bombs i kind of doubt that they have um
any kind of deliverable fusion bomb and i also have doubts that they have sufficient miniaturization
to deliver put their nuclear weapons on their so you don't think they have hydrogen bombs yet
well uh hydrogen bomb you know takes a fusion bomb to set off a fusion bomb hydrogen bomb
takes an atomic bomb to detonate a hydrant right i don't think they're going to um
they're not they're not going to have the ability to miniaturize uh certainly hydrogen bomb
technology for many years and and they may not even have the ability to miniaturize
their fusion bomb their atom bomb technology i agree with you the evidence shows that why are they
getting so belligerent and and and just so crazy is that a sign that kim jong-un is weak and he's
doing it for domestic control i think a lot of it it may be for yeah just for domestic consumption
to try to consolidate his power he comes from a whole dynasty of absolutely paranoid dictators
his father and his grandfather were both notoriously paranoid there have been multiple
killings within the family to consolidate power and to prevent any kind of attempted coup within
the regime so the level the level of paranoia the level of xenophobia is just off the charts
in north korea that's a great point people think is the west is racist or the least racist group
you go to asia man they all hate each other like it is just incredible
yeah um the the level of xenophobia there cannot be underrated and the the level of paranoia
is similarly just again off the charts so it makes it almost impossible to predict
how kim jong-un might react to particular situation all right that's why it's so dangerous
we'll keep watching an amazing analysis james resley roll survival blog.com find his books there
thank you james
what exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the american public
well political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses
to control public opinion by controlling your opinions the establishment gets you to not only
agree with their agenda but to also ensure that your government created viewpoint also
influences others in ripple effect this is how the power elite and the government stay in power
the use psychological manipulation they turn the public into obedient sheeple and over time
we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception but how does political correctness and
other deliberate deceptions work well first the establishment saturates mass media with their
agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted
as truth such as global warming for example then the establishment suppresses any counter
arguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky nutjobs racist or in the case of man made
climate change climate deniers you can learn more about this tyranny over the minds a minute
info wars dot com prism planet dot tv and our youtube channel resistance news this is kit daniel's reporting
monday through friday from 11 a.m to 3 p.m central i'm your host alec shones
this is the info war on local stations tv and radio across the country and of course
at news wars there's a war in the media news wars dot com as well as prism planet dot com
now let's go ahead and go over some of these articles i'm going to open the phones up about
the big vegas cover-up developments coming out uh the north korea situation the nfl running up the
wide flag they're trying to exercise power over america and a lot more but i'm also going to get
to a story paul watson posted this morning that i should have led the show with i just got so focused
on the incredible news of them changing the narrative admitting people were getting shot
earlier than they were inside the hotel uh that they think there were accomplices that uh he went
to the middle east i mean the whole thing's unraveling exactly as we told you it would
it's simply incredible but this big news is on info wars dot com and and you know paul sometimes
has kind of light headlines for stuff that is just over the top important and you read this story
we already know these numbers but we had 2015 numbers the government always comes out close
to a year later with last year's numbers and you can play games with statistics but murders
they those they got a really accurate number on the number of folks that actually got killed
that that deal that were enrolled is dead this is one of the most accurate numbers out there's
obviously people missing you have to factor into that but uh this is info wars dot com paul joseph
watson and this is the type of article that they censor on youtube facebook and twitter
this is what they don't want out and folks i'm not putting this out to put down black people the media
whenever there's black on white crime newspaper editors have said they tell their writers not to
say the race of the person but then if a white person kills some black people they go out of their
way mainly the white editors the leftist to say all white people are to blame because some scumbag
killed nine innocent black people in a church in south carolina but then when a black guy shoots
nine white people thank god only killing one uh and says he does it because he hates white people
they censor it if you even report on what he said or if islamists say go out and rape
western women they censor that or they censor the rape epidemic in sweden or germany i mean this
is happening to info wars this is this is going on they have republican congressional candidates
that put out really just nice friendly videos on twitter marcia blackburn it gets a couple million
views they just ban it and tell her it's banned for violating their rules so we've hit next level
censorship but listen to this censored info because we now have the 2016 numbers 10 months later we get
them usually it's a year usually it's in december we get them or or january this is a little early
uh new fbi crime stats show white privilege might not be america's biggest problem
and for every homicide by a black person there's 12.37 for white people killing 1.42
and hispanics 2.54 and if you look at the numbers from a year before that they're also in the new
one i haven't had time to just pulling on to murder rates and crime rates here it if you index it
you find whites are twice as likely per capita to be or right at twice it's it's not quite twice
right at twice as likely to be killed by police now does that mean police want to kill white people
know the only racism there is you could just say they're politically correct or scared is they slow
roll into lower income areas that happen to be black because they know they might get shot in the
back or demonized they're not going to risk their life going into a home invasion or a in many cases
a domestic disturbance that is super dangerous whether it's black folks or white folks or whoever
that's the most dangerous thing is a is a domestic disturbance because people their their emotions
are up with their mate or their kids or whatever's going on anybody knows you know tempers can flare
that's a dangerous situation to walk into some family fight people are wound up they're emotional
they're not thinking well are the cops going to roll in to say a house would you know a family
of 10 people in it while people are yelling and screaming and waving guns no they're going to
drive on down the street and call the SWAT team that's going to take them 30 minutes to an hour
to get there and by then somebody's going to be dead because you also look at the statistics a
lot of cops are getting killed going into white domestic disturbances but they're risking their
lives because on average they think they're appreciated going in there but if they're not
appreciate it and going to get shot in the back they're not going to show up so that's the facts
you got 3 000 people plus a year shot chicago close to a thousand dead nobody's talking a couple hundred
black people killed by cops thousands dead in chicago thousands shot so this this article
has the latest numbers and they're even more dramatic than the year before while some blame
mass shootings in las vegas online privilege new fbi crime statistics suggest that while white people
may not be the main source of the problem when it comes to violent crime i love how paul said
may not be these statistics are conclusive i love paul to death he's so prolific and so great
this is a very it needs to be shocking new statistics show blacks commit 10 times more
homicides in whites censored data i mean you know i don't understand whatever just get the
article out folks newly released figures covering 2016 that break down arrests in terms of race
illustrated how black people are still vastly overrepresented in virtually every crime category
despite making up 13 percent of the population total arrests of black people are 2 million
263 000 compared to 5 858 000 arrested white people who make up around 73 percent of the
population uh yeah but all of them are about to die that's why like in a decade it'll be
60 percent non-white so one reason i'm not committing a lot of crime is they're young
people commit most of the crime so see a lot of that's also skewed by that but it is the numbers
black people are the most likely and more likely than whites to be arrested for murder
and non-negligent manslaughter despite being a minority with 52.6 of arrests as category being
african americans 13 percent of the population 52 percent of the arrests for it of adults arrested
for murder 52 percent were black or african america 45.4 percent were white and 2.6 of other
races reports the fbi do you hear that black people are also overrepresented in virtually every
other category including robbery rape aggravated assault motor vehicle theft and prostitution
weapons violations and show folks those graphs okay and and remember even obama's just department
tried to manipulate these numbers down it didn't work folks and if you want to know why starting
in the 60s the black community had lower crime rates on average than many other communities
the lowest level of illegitimacy but they had the highest number of new jobs and had decided to hey
y'all you know what what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and i'm not defending what happened to
him but they said we're gonna dress nice have our own businesses and we're not gonna shop
in the cracker areas and it made them incredibly successful i'm not saying the suppression was
good but it made them have their own communities their own systems made them become successful
under the pressure and then they came in with a great society and as lbj's letters said i'm
gonna have those inwards vote and democrat for a hundred years we're gonna tell them not have men
in the house break up their families break up those black churches we're gonna have control of them
and boy did they do it then they hyped up the gangster culture in the media they pushed it that
was tough that was cool that's how a black man got ahead and they had him primed for the presence
and it's been the same thing ever since that an mtv in the in the in the early 90s they told top rock
stars i've talked to two of myself you better start doing hip hop and having these hip hop artists on
because we're gonna force feed it and make it the future we know they were just using top acts to
force feed the gangster rap you know and setting them up and they told him we don't just want the
normal rap that was pretty popular we want the gangster tough guy thug garbage so that all these
kids thought their dad that went to church and their dad that you know you know worked at a shoe
shop or was a or you know was a was a janitor and i'm not saying those are jobs they all should
have had the point was is that they were working hard that wasn't cool i'm gonna go out and rob
somebody i'm gonna be cool and the media literally advertised to black folks to become criminals and
they went and did it and then they got murdered in mass killed in mass the cocaine got shipped in
they got put in the presence and then the whole cycle was created and now they're doing to everybody
else but this crime statistic show and this with the democratic party and everybody else is pushing
this is what they want because if they can't abort black people they want to make sure you
end up in prison as hillary clinton said so you need to wake up from that trance and realize

paid any lobbying money for the american people because that's who we lobby for our myself you
remember ran paul wanted to come on six months ago his plan got pitched through
dr corcy and others but frankly course he first put out the plan and got the documents
about defunding it and and and and not letting him raid fanny may and freddy mac so he picked
it's not about credit it's showing how they're that's why they want to keep info wars off the
president's desk because the president when he gets good info acts on it this is huge
we should get corcy on tomorrow oh wait i'm not poo pooing corcy it's like some guest aren't super
viral but with targeted audiences they're super effective look at this article by kit daniels
as we predicted trump assigned ran paul health care plan trump joins forces with senator ran paul
and it's got the whole plan to basically defund it even if they don't get rid of the whole
bill them itself they just defund it and then that helps the american people not get ripped off
it forces states to bring in competition it'll lower prices give you higher quality care they
don't get to wreck american health care than come in with a single player as is equal to manuel and
jonathan gruber said they both said on television you're stupid we're wrecking it take it over
with a republican blue blood scum so big article breaking it all down and we've got all the corcy
videos in there where he broke it all down great job dr jerome corcy uh on that front
and again the sheriff departments altered the timeline saying he shot people before he opened
fire and when they said and he did go to the middle east like we first told you and he checked in
three days early like we first told you and and and just oh i mean it's just everything we told
you's coming up oh and newsweek says isis may be behind it now
oh and uh the new york times have been caught on tape admitting that they slanted news against
conservatives and trump uh we don't really need project veritas to tell us that but it's
nice to have the video isn't it oh and i almost forgot little zook zookie newsweek's reporting
he exploited disaster with portoreca virtual reality he he he partners with the red cross
because then they keep 90 percent of the money it's all big global scam so a did that and then
he shows himself in portoreca telling you how to do it it's a virtual reality
and that nice his little sick avatar it looks like it's what a three-year-old would watch i love
that everything zuckerberg and npr and all of them do is talk to you like you're an idiot you know
that doesn't make sense we're not idiots they admit the message is the medium the message
is the medium the the the the the delivery form the way they give you the delivery the fact that
it's dumb down is designed to dumb you down the medium is the message and the message is the medium
but the medium is the message to dumb you down to just talk to you like oh and you and you get the
internal facebook documents we want to savage their minds keep them totally depressed and isolated
with our avatars controlling them then we can slowly make them depressed give them prozac and
luvox ads while the avatars steer them towards our final objective i am mark zuckerberg psychopath god

children those slave factory iPhones and let us into your minds because we're gonna tear you apart
we're liberal oh we're so liberal liberal

zuckerberg is no god he's a genetic psychopath there's nothing but a front man of old psychopaths
and he's the he's what they think's the young and trendy oh look i'm trendy i'm zuckerberg

ibm's front company i'm the hybrid boy genius look at that that is total complete lower brain

com you're listening to the alex jones show
coming up we're going to air the video edited down because it's a long video of a lady and
others going through the hotel at belogio saying they saw shell casings bullets and
uh you know the police told that that they were under attack as well i mean this went on you can
hear the shots coming from near the belogio we've already played those a bunch they're now admitting
that he shot a security guard um six seven minutes before any of this happened they're changing their
timeline now newsweek says it might have been ices i mean this is a lot of big developments uh on
that front so we're going to go to melissa eric matt we're going to go to a b steven luke yoshi
and many many others let's go to utah and let's talk to matt in utah matt you're on the air welcome
having a good day matt
yes absolutely go ahead you're on the air so uh you know i got the thinking about it you
looked at all these other tests the dots over in europe and you always have days it's not weeks later
they are making a rest why are we the fools here in the united states that aren't investigating
anybody else you look at this girlfriend and that's it they're wanting us to settle on this one guy i
don't think so man there's no way well that's because 90 of the justice department is still
obama uh clinton holdovers and they're just blocking trump i appreciate your call we got
some background noise there thanks man good point i mean we have the whole story's unraveled
it's admitted he went to the mentally should submit it that he shot people beforehand it's
admitted that other stuff was going on it's admitted uh that that he had people there three
days before it's admitted there's a cover-up and they keep changing their story and we have the
hostage rescue team source and we have all the military sources saying clearly it's multiple
firearms this is powerful information thank you matt now let's talk to melissa in california
melissa you're on the air go ahead hi alec um i was calling because i haven't heard anyone address
this yet uh in the beginning when the press originally leaked the photos they were on there
for like four hours before they cut some stuff out of it even now if you go to the uk uh website
or where where they leaked them um it's cut out of their original picture there is a shoe in the
picture and you can see that it's a pant leg and then behind the chair back there is something
it's like a plaid shirt it has uh black and white and you can tell that it's the body
you know i remember those photos in the sun the daily mail and i didn't see them anymore
where it's like his leg under the bipod and there is some stuff under the table uh you're
saying that's been taken down well you can still view it but you won't be able to see the actual
sheriff uh detective who's examining the bullet wound obviously up ahead in there um i did some
research on my own and i looked up the sheriff's department and i got uh pictures of everyone
well there's a black lady and she has a white watch on and if you look in the photo you can
see the white watch you can see her hand on the head of whatever's back there and it would make
sense well listen man screenshot all this and send it to show tips at info wars dot com right now
all you guys see because it's the listeners and viewers that keep digging all this up
please send it right now but let me add this what do you make of all the videos of multiple guns
going off all the shooting experts saying it's the case and the sheriff's department now changing
their story saying he shot people before he went on the rampage and for 10 days they've been covering
that up now admitting he went to the middle east which our source is told to stay one what do you
make of now newsweek having to admit that yes indeed it may be a nice attack well i think it is i
think it is a terrorist attack and i think that they didn't get the tip in time that it was going
to happen and they didn't get there and i have a feeling i have never seen a picture of hate or
jesus compost you know who is this guy he's busy a cia is he i mean well man give me a favor
we're gonna look into what you're saying but i remember it was like in the sun it was in the
daily mail i remember the photo that it was wider and later i saw crop photos so memory
serves what you're saying everybody send what she's talking about the show tips info wars dot
com thank you melissa and these are great calls we're going to ferret all the south some of us
can end up not being accurate like day one monday it will you hear the gun going off looks like a
flash uh from the fifth or sixth floor turns out it's a strobe light saw other videos showing
that that was the case we said folks that was a lead we followed wasn't right by monday afternoon
media today came out and said jones says uh you know this week that it's just that it's a shooting
but we know it's a strobe light see they're they're going back to what we early said to find
anything is wrong because they're so freaked out that they know that we've been proven right yet
again okay let's take more calls eric in ohio once we talk about the vegas cover-up i mean it's
now a cover-up folks i mean but we've solved the case in that we know they're covering it up
and the islamic connections are evident i mean we have the hrt sources uh go ahead eric hey thanks
for taking my call alex you and mr roll has already touched on it but obviously we have
an additional confirmed shooter at the beloggio uh i'm sure you've also heard reports that they were
there was a shooter at tropic canna and possibly even down at ground level at the concert uh my
theory at this point is this was supposed to be a much larger attack possibly as many as 20 plus
shooters uh explosives involved complete chaos um two points on that one as mr rolls is uh correctly
pointed out several times you can only shoot one gun at a time okay an accountant for yeah i've been
shooting ars and building ars for 15 years even if one of our two jams there's still 20 plus guns in
that room so i think the reason he got the hotel room early is because he was expecting more co-conspirators
to come to the room to get armed hence the camera system hence the additional death and then and then
he got set up yeah now assuming the other shooters at the beloggio and tropic canna are confirmed
and police did take them out it'd be very telling to find out sure it would probably mean that they
were going to set him up but still try to get their shots in but then from from our witnesses the
beloggio the cops shot those people or stopped them so looks like they were more on the ground
um yeah and let's see if there's any hotel security footage of those shooters going in and
out of this let me ask you this what do you make of the whole story unraveling so fast
i i think it with this day and age it's inevitable with the amount of technology the cell phone
cameras it it just becomes harder and harder oh the second point i wanted to make was you
heard the police uh the sheriff say that patrick had a plan to escape correct yes so why make a plan
to escape if you're a lone wolf and you have one exit on a 30 well he didn't commit suicide i was
told that by the hrt and they've been proven totally correct absolutely so if you're going to
have a plan to escape if you think you're going to escape all right it's not going to happen if
you're going to go one on one with squad now if you have multiple shooters spread out throughout
the city all right you have explosives you have 20 plus shooters complete chaos that really really
really increases your chances of not being zeroed in on and that's what the best brains think is
that most people got cold feet warned the crowd and that only two to three shooters were willing
to carry out the triangulated fire and that's why his brother eric is so squirrely he knew about it
absolutely last point real quick alec i would just want to remind everybody let's not forget
about the old you're all going to die lady okay so what more do we know about her we're more
interestingly why don't we know more about her well you sound like you do this professionally
eric we're in the military you're a cop no sir near well i mean the citizens are out there looking
at this for themselves they're not buying it uh and we and we've got that footage coming up from
the Bellagio and we're going to be playing for folks anything else eric no sir you know since
we mentioned that can we play the lady saying they're all in a dime and other witnesses reportedly
told the cops to us so the cops are looking for who's saying this i mean i think it's clearly not
hotel staff because they would just go tell the cops uh it means probably people that got cold
feet but what a weird way to get cold feet why wouldn't you just call the police and say there's
about to be a mass shooting but then i go back to how do you get all those guns up in that hotel
room when even top you know when and others top casino owners go we profile you when you leave we
search your room i mean that's what they do here's the clip of the lady uh that night uh there on
october first talking about being warned you're all going to die so there is a lady who pushed
her way forward into the concert venue under the first row and she started messing with another
lady and told us that we are all going to die tonight would you know why she was saying that i
mean it was this after she the shots were fired or it was about 45 minutes before the shots were
actually fired but then she was escorted out by security all right folks we're going to go
to break and come right back thanks for the call eric more calls straight ahead on other issues as
well we're going to go to luke steven b thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry
our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for
quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our
vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death i personally counter this
onslaught with anthroplex anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create

each other that top military experts federal officers that testify in federal court acoustic
experts on uh like craig soyer saying clothe there's two different rifles going off the same time
in the first two and a half minutes we played those but you've got at the bellagio close to a
mile away renae downs and her husband who's a marine and said you know clearly heard shots right up
close shell casings glass on the ground her husband jumped on top over the cop said kit get back inside
they were sheltering in place she shot her facebook mentions when they were hours later
still in their huddled so we're going to play some clips of her talking about what happened
that night and another interview she did after that here it is and again this fits into the
direction of the shots close to a mile away but but but but but but but but and then later
bam bam bam bam right up on top at the mandalay right where the shootings we know took place
so uh here is that footage but these are all the people randomly sitting inside
all right had a little bit of a glitch on that video we'll get to that later there's always
this it's metaphysical there's always this rush to get a video and then it's always at the end
and and then it doesn't work so i just had a gut feeling not to play that video we'll have that later
with oan shroyer at three o'clock uh coming up a little bit later in the broadcast with the war
room we're going to air it all together we're going to air the guns going off we're going to air

at three o'clock today now let's continue with the news here as i was going to do world's first
sex doll brothel is being bombarded with requests for pedophilia and rape sessions by twisted pervs
that's right owner reports to folks that's out of the sign that's being reported right now ladies
and gentlemen that's the type of serious cultural rot uh that's going on in this culture and this
world also robocops have been deployed in busy city centers in a bit of control holiday crowd just
little robots that look like uh the dollocks or whatever they're called and from doctor who
exterminate exterminate all they need is a little little extermination deals on it exterminate
exterminate uh so there you go continue liquor makers need to sober up who decline in teenage
drinking that's because they're busy on a bunch of prozac drugs and smoking marijuana that's
more hardcore than heroin in many cases commit a crime your fitbit key fob or pacemaker could
snitch on you yes all little household and body appliances watching and tracking you in lifetime
so loving continuing uh fingerprint test that reveals a criminal's lifestyle to be used in court
in months the fingerprint technology can provide a criminal's lifestyle could be admissible in court
and a capable of detecting trace drugs blood alcohol condom lubricants hair and cleaning
products at other substances of forensic interest researchers say could help investigators
learn much about a criminal's activities just from a fingerprint they can also fake fingerprints
and fake all that which they've been caught doing why we're exhausted stress and social media are
taking their toll u.s. say today yes all this computer time all the facebooking all the trying
to keep track of it lowers our attention span to that of daria in saving or finding or whatever
it's called nemo and it's not good for you take the phones away from your children stop letting
them watch all the television go outside you will be happier the folks ask why are you on the air
why are you in the matrix why do you do all this because i have to jack into this to reach people
but i don't want to be here i want to wake people up young people are more interested in threesomes
than ever that's a big article out university of new brunswick found canadian students are thinking
more freely about threesomes but are held back by experience because of fear of being stigmatized
no what's happening is they're less sexually active now on average older people are more active
and so they see all this online i think that's what a relationship is until they actually experience
it and it's not all it's cracked up to be just ask anybody i've read about that myself never
actually get it all the psychological studies uh is that uh it's not very fun uh let's continue
here ladies and gentlemen but i mentioned earlier the big article by paul joseph watson
getting into massive black on white crime in the 2016 crime statistics that came out showing the
whole black lives matter thing is a complete and total fabrication who's really being targeted
racially is white people does that mean i hate black people no does that mean the most black
people are like this no but it means the new black panther party and other groups including
cnn promote killing white people as if they deserve it because they hype up the few questionable
black deaths as if it's the end of the world to create the racial division totally cold blooded
and completely and totally sickening i'm gonna go back to a few of your phone calls here in a
moment but just again briefly this is about to end caveman with the bone broth with the turmeric
with the chaga mushroom with the other concentrated things like b pollen it is about to sell out 50
percent off is about to stop because i'm not going to run it up till it sells out i'm gonna

today as well so be sure and check those out you know i want to play one more clip here i played
the first man in clip uh where he gets into all the things that are happening and how we're waging
war on the republican establishment and how they're the main enemy and i totally agree with that i
want to play his second clip about how corker is quitting because he's a loser and now he may get
indicted so that's why he's attacking trump and he gets into the fact that uh he would get crushed by
marsha blackburn who twitter and others are now censoring but it's only blowing up in their face
so let's go ahead and play this clip then we'll go to break and come back with some more of your
phone calls ahead of the guest host that will be hosting the fourth hour here it is pulled by people
in the room ben sass john mccain linsey graham uh corker and even mcconnell they trashed the
president but yet they can't get any of their promises completed i've they are the swamp
republicans are weak and pathetic and they're lacking in identity and the forgotten men and
women the vote of this election are being let down look they hold totally have total contempt
for the forgotten man they have total contempt for the base that's what you saw in alabama
in alabama where they came in with uh luther strange with 32 million dollars to destroy
judge more you saw at the base thought of them right the base totally rejects them these people
have no respect for the working men and women in the united states i tell you what senator corker
is an absolute disgrace and i agree with jason miller who is the comms director
on our campaign i think one of the best comms people around jason's on cnn but he never talks
out of school sorry to hear that he well on cnn today he called for senator corker to resign
i agree with him for the governor of tennessee to replace him with marsha blackburn a real
conservative if bob corker has any honor any decency he should resign immediately he should
not let those words stand away said about the president he wouldn't win steve that's why he's
really getting out by the way he got out because he saw what happened in alabama if he wants to
by the way he should get back in because he's gonna get crushed by blackburn would kill he's
gonna get crushed in a primary he doesn't have the guts to get in so he doesn't have the guts to
get back in the race he should resign there are a bunch of cowards that just want to run around
acting official and powerful when the whole world's moved on everyone hates them and nothing will put
these scumbags back together again by the way paul joseph watson is hosting the fourth hour today
it's going to be very informative i'm told a lot of breaking news there and then we've got the three
hour war room with oan shroyer and others where we're going to go through right at the start of
the show all the witnesses the multiple shooters the fact that they've come out and had to admit
that we're right that he shot people earlier on supposedly and there's all these coverups and he
did go to the middle east and he was there earlier than they said the cover-up is imploding another
huge victory for the truth and justice and for our credibility they're trying to destroy
so we just go with the truth go with our research go with our gut and continues to pan out over
and over again so thank you as listeners for your support because info wars is only one focal point
of the global awakening against tyranny that's happening from africa from south america to central
america to north america to asia to uh what's happening in in eurasia what's happening in europe
it is an amazing time to be alive and i am just so honored to be here the fourth hour coming up
straight ahead you know a lot of times i hosted other times guest host house it's always a great

jones show lie from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones don't try it on me
got a caller here from tokyo i didn't realize but hold on to 30 minutes let's talk about north korea
world war three the poll watch that's coming up live from london england let's go ahead and go to
yoshi in tokyo yoshi you're on the air worldwide that's the jones it's an honor to be here my uh
hundred-year-old grandmother enjoys the caveman well thank you she lost her balance so she keeps
falling but she never breaks the bone i don't know if it's helping but yeah it's tasty and
and it's really a staple here wow you get it all the way to tokyo thank you for the support sir
yeah the shipping cost is really a pain there's never we'll try to get some international
distributors or something like or maybe have 50 off for folks that are overseas or something to
alleviate that yeah that would significantly increase my purchase as it's because sometimes i buy
something and then one third of the cost is just uh i understand or customs tries to hold it up i know
folks ordering overseas are really uh really really doing it as as a service to us so thank you
oh yeah so anyway so i'm in tokyo i'm half japanese but i've been here most of my life
the issue is north korea and the belligerent or diplomatic solution and i'm rather disturbed
are sad to see that informers or yourself have taken a stance that there is no diplomatic solution
but uh i have well i have faith in your ability to read and do research but it seems maybe mister
noticed that there's this old treaty called the agreed framework which uh initially was supposed
to halt uh nuclear weapons development by north korea by stopping their construction of these
nuclear um sure the framework agreement was given reactors and everything and they stopped
doing it but they gave them reactors they can build the fissile material so i'm aware of all
those framework agreements when it goes back to like jimmy carter and people right no the framework
of agreement is under clinton sure the fool that's when they transferred them to stop but i think
they started negotiations i'm saying with clinton they use jimmy carter as the envoy
yeah but the perhaps the misunderstanding is that giving them the agreement under the agreement is
to give them uh light water reactors but there was never any funding to do so the u.s congress
did not want to do so well let me say this i do believe there's diplomatic stuff i don't want a war
or i've only looked at both sides of this and i i think kim jong-un's a really bad guy and
his firing missiles right over you know the uh your country japan but but i i mean i think
a war would be disastrous but i know even the japanese government's getting more hard line
with kim jong-un well i mean why do you think that's happening and what do you think should happen
look if japan wasn't such a country because of well being bombed back to the stone age
so to speak and with the new treat constitution and all the brainwashing that the americans
instituted subsequently to make us feel so thoroughly guilt ridden that we're so we aren't so
militarist but uh economic sanctioned on an extremely poor country won't help at all but
you see uh so don't understand it was just starboard people but you're saying if you had your own
military uh then then then north korea wouldn't be acting like this or what are you saying
if we did then we probably have already sent special forces in the 80s or 90s to reclaim our
people japan really loves north korea especially after they've abducted our people but that's not
really oh yeah exactly like kim jong-un's father kim jong-il used to kidnap lots of folks just for
his own sexual pleasure sexual pleasure and forcing people to teach uh their spies japanese
or other other things technical things but there you are saying how bad north korea is and then
and then we're bad for saying they're bad i mean i'm just not gonna say they're good that's all
so yeah that's that's a given they're universally hated and uh as uh one of the phrases we like to
say is that north korea is like the the uh vial armpit of asia nobody wants to get well it's
certainly an oppressive communist regime thank you for the call yoshi thanks for your support call
back again i'd love to talk longer whole watch is coming up stay with us it was thomas jefferson
who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what rodeo will
pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary
consequence jefferson was warning us about the global elite the one percent of the one percent
consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we
didn't heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society which were treated as indentured
servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer represents
the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance
into the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for civilization and culture yet
we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments
around the world we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against the
other conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us realize this truth as thomas
jefferson also said enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind
will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day this is kit daniels within full wars dot com
we alive it is the fourth hour of the alex jones show coming up at the bottom of the hour we
have a special guest he's an actor and a model young guy just making his way in the world
he was fired for supporting donald trump he was fired for being a conservative he's going to tell
you the full story it ties into the whole harvey winestein situation which is still blowing up
hillary clinton it took hillary clinton less than what five hours to blame the nla for the last
vegas massacre it took her five days to disavow to finally condemn harvey winestein this is cnn
hillary can hillary clinton condemns longtime democratic donor harvey winestein hillary clinton
condemned disgrace hollywood executive harvey winestein on tuesday marking her first public
comments on the matter since reports of his alleged predatory behavior broke five days ago
so is she going to give the one million plus dollars that harvey winestein donated to her
campaign to a rape victims charity don't hold your breath she said quote the behavior described
by women cannot be tolerated that's what hillary clinton said about harvey winestein the behavior
described by women cannot be tolerated unless your name is bill clinton of course and then hillary
will not only tolerate that behavior she'll intimidate the victims on your behalf so she's
finally condemned it after five days we have countless hollywood celebrities who have worked
closely with winestein who have spiked this story who have helped get this story spiked in the past
still refusing to come out matt daemon it's amazing the most self-righteous people the most
vehement self-righteous people on every other issue which which is what matt daemon is those are
always the people who have the biggest skeletons in the closet he was one of the guys who made the
phone call back in 2004 when this was about to blow up in the new york times they spiked it
it was matt daemon and ben afleck well even ben afleck now has been forced to come out five days
later and disavow but again after everybody else already did it he was the what he was the first
one that should have disavowed it because he helped spike this story back in 2004 when the new york
times had it and they sunk it so this continues to rumble of course we had new revelations today
the new yorkers put out a giant article which i've read most of it it'll tell you about an hour to
read the whole thing describing detailing what these victims actually went through and it really
puts to shame those people who have been claiming over the past few days that there's any equivalency
between the trump grabber by the you know what tape and the serial mechanized industrial abuse
the harvey weinstein raw over the course of three decades remember we had stelter brian stelter of
cnn we had rob briner come out yesterday a couple of days ago and say oh this is trump is even worse
trump's locker room talk is worse than this guy allegedly raping women if you read about the
details of it we can't get into the details of it because that's a graphic he's comparing a
trump's hollywood access tape well he said you know they let them grab you by the you know what
to actual incidents where harvey weinstein would lure these women frightened young women often
less than 25 years old a lot of them he would lure them to his hotel room he would strip down naked
expose himself basically grab their head and force them to perform oral sex which is rape
they're comparing that to trump laughing and saying oh yeah these women throw themselves at you
they'll let you grab by the way this guy could get any stars that wanted a job to do it or the
best call girls he wanted the power over these young women particularly young 18 years old you
name it he wanted them to basically vomit while the pig creature raped them reportedly
no that's exactly it he wanted the power he could have he could have paid for prostitutes
he was a multi-millionaire this is a quote alex from the new york hospital is one of the victims
weinstein's worth billions chart go ahead yeah this is one of the victims this is a quote i was
very petrified but i didn't want to show him that i was petrified because i could feel
that the more i was freaking out the more he was excited now this is a young woman who was again
was lured up to his hotel room on false pretenses they were often told oh yeah there's going to
be another woman there to discuss a business arrangement or whatever she added it was like a
hunter with a wild animal the fear turns him on she said she was leaving and he panicked we haven't
done anything she remembered him saying it's like being in a walt Disney movie so the fear that these
women showed the more nervous and frightened they got the more it turned him on so that's what it was
all about this is a more kind of a serial killer thing and that's why they're in the kids it's because
it's about panicking people yeah it's like the hunters like what he says like seeing the animal
panic the predator gets more excited the more the animal panics they'd savor the kill even more
and that's the same kind of attitude that these victims describe with harvey weinstein
you've got his allies still coming out fashion designer donna caron defending him she basically
said these women were asking for it now that's an important distinction to make of course
none of these women are asking for it by the way they dress the way they behave in many cases they
were lured they were procured under false pretenses it wasn't a date situation it was a business
situation in the vast majority of these cases where these women were raped they were going there for
a meeting they thought they'd get a business opportunity it wasn't a romantic thing so again
to compare it to the trump grab them by the you know what tape is a complete misnomer you have
to make that distinction these were frightened young women this wasn't a romantic situation
now there is a situation where certain women some women are predatory and will throw themselves
at famous men because power is an aphrodisiac that's the context of the trump hollywood access tape
has nothing to do with rape it's trump talking about predatory women who throw themselves at
famous men if you want to deny that that exists then fine you're living in an alternate reality
it does but again that's some women not all women these women described in these cases were not
meeting him under any kind of pretenses they weren't interested in him sexually or romantically
he's a big fat blob he's a horrible individual this was completely predatory on the part of
Weinstein so to blame the victims which of course is what we hear in the cases of um
islamic grooming especially over in this country leftist blaming the victims because
they're wearing skirts or whatever they're walking through the streets at night we see it once again
with the left in this case with the big fashion designer coming out and defending him despite
the fact that again when you get into the details of this there's no there's no room for defense
and paul let me just add one point if i can and i'm gonna get out here but i've been
eating my lunch watching you break this down the very same feminist people are coming out
defending him these older feminist women are coming out saying oh these women asked for it
well they these are the same feminists that claim all men are rapist and western culture is evil
but they love islam and so the very hollywood that covered this up is the one telling us that the
west is bad while they defend islam because they get off on the power that islam has over women
these are truly deviant evil people as you've been saying no they're the first ones to blame i mean
look at the college rape hoax they claim that one in four one in five women were going to be
victims of rape on college campuses they based that on a study which was completely out of the
norm based on an an adult community center in one instance and suddenly that became a narrative
echoed across the world even obama started talking about it but when it's one of their own
it literally takes them five days five days after these revelations come out to finally
distance themselves from it and you've still got people like michael moore who praised winstein in
a 2015 tweet basically said he was amazing to work with michael moore has still not disavowed even
after the onrush even after the deluge of people who disavowed today including ben afleck you've
got michael moore you've got matt daemon in fact i tweeted about it collin furth another one who
worked closely with winstein who has not disavowed and again these are the same people who will
line up and attack trump all day for not disavowing david do during the campaign
even though he did over and over again do you disavow do you disavow yes i disavow
a week later do you disavow yes i disavow they're obsessed with disavowals as soon as it's their
turn to disavow anything they go awol matt daemon michael moore collin furth brad pit
leonardo de caprio rossel crow and again it's always these actors like leonardo de caprio it
was so vehement and morally righteous about all their little pet political issues and they'll never
shut up about them while being complete hypocrites like with de caprio taking private jets everywhere
hanging out on giant yachts with oil billionaires while lecturing you about your energies they're
always the same kind of people so vehement so right just leon dignan and they're the ones who
are completely silent all of them bodies with wine steen all of them remain silent because i'm

to take on this deep state establishment which has been somewhat embarrassed by these harvey
Weinstein revelations in recent days now the deluge of celebrities and politicians on the
left finally coming forward with their disavowals too little too late of course on the first night
of this or the first couple of nights the late night comedy shows which railed endlessly about
Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly did not mention this once they finally had to all mention it
in unison last night and make jokes about it because of course the previous night they had
written the jokes and they were basically sworn off telling them protection once again if you
find out about the level of abuse the sheer level of abuse that Weinstein got away with for so long
he had to have powerful protectors at every single level of Hollywood and of course many of those
same people work within television as well so why do you think it took all this time all this public
pressure to make these people come forward and to make those late night talk show hosts actually
have to mention this now we're going to go to this clip which is basically a Weinstein with
one of his victims now from what I read I believe they're stood outside his hotel room he's basically
trying to go into the hotel room and get naked which is what he tried to do in almost every
instance he's trying to convince this woman to come into the room with him having already
groped her previously let's go to this clip i'm telling you right now what do we have to do here
i've been i'm gonna take a shower you sit there and have a drink why don't drink can i stay on the
bar no you must come here now no please i don't want to i'm not doing anything that you want to come
here i'm sorry i don't know no yesterday was a kind of aggressive for me i need to know a person
i won't do a thing i don't do anything please i swear i won't just sit with me don't embarrass me
in the hotel i'm here all the time i don't know but i don't want to please sit there please one
minute no i can't go to the bathroom please i don't want to do something i don't want to go to the
come here listen to me i want to go downstairs you're not going to do anything you'll never see me
again after this that's it if you don't if you embarrass me in this hotel i'm not embarrassing
you it's just that i don't i don't feel comfortable i mean don't have a fight with me please i'm not
going to do anything i swear my children please come in on everything i'm a famous guy i'm feeling
very uncomfortable right now please come in now and one minute and if you want to leave when the guy
comes with my jacket why yesterday you touched my wrist please i'm sorry just come on i'm used to
that come on are you used to that yes come in no but i'm not used to that i won't do it again come on
sit here sit here for a minute please no i don't want to sit here this now do an embarrassment
i don't like you'll call me again i'm sorry i'm sorry i promise you i won't do it i know but
yesterday was too much coming i will never do another thing to you five minutes don't ruin
your friendship with me for five minutes i know but it's kind of like it's too much for me okay
please you're making a big scene here so there you hear harvey weinstein again trying to groom
this poor woman trying to basically verbally beat her down to come into his hotel room you heard him
say there that he was used to it what did he mean by that well that was revealed in a separate
instance where he bragged about being used to women saying no and they said no over and over
and over again until he pressured them into it either physically or via verbal intimidation threats
that he would ruin their careers if they didn't go along with it so that's what he meant when he said
oh i'm used to it when she kept saying no no no i don't want to go in i don't want to go in and
going back to what i said before he got excitement according to one of his victims he would he got
excited the more they resisted the more frightened they became that actually turned him on this is
the level of depravity that we're dealing with here let's read another quote from the new york
article again from one of his female victims i was very petrified again that's the one we just
read out she said that he got off on her freaking out i mean that's basically serial killer mentality
not that he's a serial killer but it's the same kind of mentality there's another quote
and it's by the same woman who said quote i know that everybody i mean everybody in
hollywood knows that it's happening of course that was before the last couple of days of revelations
when nobody had come out and disavowed it so everybody knew about it back then he's been
getting away with it for three decades same thing with the jimmy savill pedophile scandal over in
britain where everybody in the entertainment industry in britain knew about it and he got away
with it because he was being protected by higher ups who's protecting harvey winestein who was
protecting him at least for the past three decades that will probably never come to life will it
we do know that matt daemon who still hasn't come out and disavowed him this is out of the daily mail
matt daemon called spineless profiteer who stays silent by harvey winestein victim rose mcgowan
matt daemon may soon be forced to comment on the decades of sexual harassment harvey winestein
inflicted upon his staff and a number of hollywood actresses after one of those stars took aim at the
oscar winning writer and star of goodwill hunting again this is about how they found out what they
knew about the fact that winestein's procura was being paid 400 000 a year for a role in a film
company when he was doing nothing whatsoever in that film company his entire job was to procure
women so that harvey winestein could try and sexually abuse them matt daemon according to
this article and russell crow knew about it they made phone calls that spiked an investigation in
the new york times back in 2004 13 years ago they helped cover it up absolutely incredible
revelations will be back though with our guest continuing to talk about hollywood after the

now we're going to see we're going to take a look into how hollywood in the entertainment
industry treats people with conservative beliefs and we're talking to our guest who is
lucas dozer a young model an actor and we're going to get his side of the story of what happened
to him you're going to want to hear this and he is live with us now lucas welcome to the show
hi thanks for having me good to have you now you're a young model actor you you were hired by
this agency you signed a contract with them if you want to name the agency that's up to you
but tell us what happened over the past week or so well basically um so as you said a year and a
half ago i was given the opportunity to work with this agency and during this time um i developed
a presence on social media um but the agency was it's the fact that um i was expressing my views
politically and specifically they really disliked a photo that i had on facebook with a it was
president trump with a caption that read my president um and a few months later so like last
week um i was informed that my um by email that my contract had been terminated due to my polarizing
views and it's it's important to remember that polarizing to the to the left is anything that i
mean factual that they can't agree with and now paul something like this definitely wouldn't have
happened if um i would have encouraged blowing up the white house like madonna did publicly
and it wouldn't have happened if i supported kneeling for the anthem or for the flag of the
united states and definitely wouldn't have happened if um i would have been um making threats like
we see many leftists do on social media towards our president and so you were posting this these
pro-trump memes and i mean let's get it clear you're 16 17 now right yeah i'm 17 so you're
not even old enough to vote but they were so triggered they were so insecure at the fact that
you had god forbid conservative political opinions you posted some things uh tell us exactly the
process of how they informed you and then what happened what was your response to them basically
threatening to fire you right yeah so like i just received an email one day and i mean
they just told me that um they weren't going to um they don't want to be associated with someone
that has the views the polarizing views which i had according to them of course and they yeah
they just said that they won't appreciate and they don't have a placement for me at the agency
absolutely insane so a 17 year old kid they were so triggered by this so left
perplexed by this like they've never had it before they've never seen anyone god forbid express
conservative political beliefs now is there any kind of legal recourse on this are you gonna try
and pursue it legally or you're just gonna leave it as it is for now and try and get a contract
with another agency you know i think i mean i've got input from many of my other friends and they
just said that you know if they're not going to accept you there then just try somewhere else
and i mean i'm probably not going to sue them just because i mean my attorney said that it's
freedom of speech so i mean i think i'm just gonna leave it as it is um and just find work
with another agency that will actually appreciate my work absolutely incredible just to make it
clear to people james woods came out a couple years ago and said the reason he doesn't expect
to work in hollywood again is that he criticized obama we literally now have to have clandestine
secret societies of conservatives in hollywood where they can meet and express their opinions
without fear of censure without people and being in fear of people destroying their careers
on the flip side we've got this harvey weinstein thing which we'll get into in a moment but
i mean lucas did you have any idea going into this industry as a young man trying to get a
start in this industry how utterly intolerant they are and what does it say about them that they
react in this way to a 17 year old guy with conservative political opinions you know going
into this industry i know that like i mean you have to be a liberal a real liberal in the
entertainment industry and if you're publicly a conservative you're seen as a racist as a
sexist all these things that the left is seeing us and um honestly i think it's just upsetting with
everything i mean there are many many people in hollywood um that are not appreciative of
conservatives and are they say that they're tolerant of other ideologies well it doesn't
seem like they truly are i mean you look at stacy dash you look at all these other actresses um
that were actually fired and like not um they didn't want to their agencies or whatever clients
didn't want to associate themselves with someone that's a conservative now we've seen hollywood
losing money in fact i'm going to do a big video on this in a couple of days time their box office
receipts are down now even on what they were in 2002 despite the fact that they have way more
screens they had the worst summer i believe in terms of box office income in 15 years the worst
summer box office income in hollywood do you think that's to do with this kind of virtue
signaling that we see inserted into everything at the movie level at the tv level the americans
are finally starting to get jaded they're finally starting to switch off or do you think the reason
why hollywood's starting to struggle in terms of income is basically that people are making crappy
movies they have no imagination you know everything's a superhero sequel but do you think also there's
some level of uh you know jaded sentimentality among americans where they see now that hollywood
in the culture war is basically being used as a political tool to bludgeon people into compliance
into carrying into adopting leftist dogmas and they've just stopped caring about their primary
role which is to make good movies what do you think about that well i definitely agree with you i
think that the fact is the man like americans are really upset with the fact and i mean you just look
at the nfo i mean you have the ratings down why because you're targeting our flag you're targeting
our anthem and it's despicable and the american people we can see if they're not intolerant we've
seen it with the election of president trump they're sick and tired of all these um of the
establishment in hollywood and in washington um you see all the corrupt corruption of the lies
the secrets the uh dark side of hollywood and that's um you see that trend in washington dc as well
and the american people aren't going to tolerate it and that's why um the numbers are low for hollywood
now talking about the dark side of hollywood obviously today we've been talking about these
harvey weinstein revelations in the past we've had revelations from other hollywood
child actors obviously you you're not in the industry fully yet but you you may have some
knowledge of this of this sexual abuse at some levels it's it's the harvey weinstein type at
other levels it's actually uh accusations of pedophilia in hollywood of course we had the whole
roman polanski scandal which rumbled on for decades with people like meryl streep saying that she was
sorry he was in jail some of the same people that were close to harvey weinstein have defended
roman polanski in the past just from your experience which i know is going to be limited at this stage
but have you heard these stories about this mass sexual abuse problem within hollywood
uh just from being just from getting into the industry yeah definitely i mean um i've read
into all these things and i'm really disgusted by all these allegations and definitely don't want
to glorify these actions however what is troubling is that neither for example with the uh weinstein
case um neither hillary nor obama have called out these allegations even uh given that they nearly
nearly uh ruined trump's um trump after allegations against him surfaced and it's just yet another
example of the hypocrisy on the left and them just turning a blind eye whenever monetary campaign
donations are involved all right stay there lucas is that we'll be back after the break don't go away

you're listening to the alex jones show
day after day alone on a hill the man with the foolish grain is keeping perfectly
we are live this is the fourth hour of the alex jones show talking to lucas dozer who is a
young up and coming model an actor who was told who was informed by his agency that he would be
fired because of his political support on social media he wasn't even an activist he wasn't really
that visible he was just expressing support for conservative ideas for donald trump on twitter
that he would be fired if he did not remove those post lucas they actually said if you remove the
post then things might get better and they might keep you on that's what they told you right
yeah they did that's exactly what they told me after i had a meeting with them um a few months
back and you know obviously i kind of said no i didn't want to remove my posts and i think
that if i was going to lose my job then i for supporting the president then that's kind of
silly you know it's amazing i mean we have an industry with hollywood that protects this
serious this serial sexual abuser of women harvey winstein for 30 plus years it takes most of them
five days to come out and disavow him that's the kind of thing that they will tolerate for 30 years
you've got conservative views as a 16 17 year old up and coming actor and that cannot be tolerated
absolutely incredible even with tv now you've got you know tim allen he had the big hit show with abc
for the time slot he was doing really well last man standing that got cancelled we speculated it
was because of his conservative views which again weren't even that vehemently expressed but he later
came out and confirmed that that was probably why they cancelled it you've got a hollywood secret
society where they literally have to have clandestine meetings you've got people coming out blowing the
whistle elijah would the lord of the ring star came out last year and said that he was preyed upon
as a child actor you got a big pedophile problem in the music industry in hollywood you've got big
serial sexual abusers but no you're the problem a 17 year old with a twitter account absolutely
incredible i mean does it does it put you off pursuing your career knowing how ridiculously
hypocritical and in fact dirty and seedy that this industry is you know i don't think it really
puts me off i just think it kind of empowers me i want to go into this industry i know it's hard
as a conservative and but i'm still going to fight it and i've set my goals high and i'm
going to follow them regardless of what others say or what others think of my political views
so at no stage did you think oh i i can just hide my political views and things are going to be a
lot easier that thought process never crossed your mind right uh i would say maybe it did for a
for a short period of time but then i thought like where's the freedom of speech i mean i'm going to
express my opinions i mean they're not as long as i'm not threatening someone i'm going to support
my president i'm going to be proud of my country and i'm going to be proud of my flag and i'm going
to be proud of everything american i'm not going to hide that amazing well it's it's not a surprise
that it happened i guess the only surprise is that you're so young and yet they got so insecure
and targeted you for it anyway that's a surprising angle a bit i just think close in here tell people
how they can follow you on twitter and any other information you want to tell them about well exactly
go follow please i would like to ask for everyone to follow on twitter i'm going to be posting more
information about the entire story the process and everything i mean i'm trying to get in contact
i'm still trying to get in contact with the agency but definitely i've had some supporters
already like sending threatening messages and i condemned any threatening messages that were
sent toward the agency i don't think that as conservatives we should be doing things like
that we should be better than what the leftists are doing living in chicago i can see on a daily
basis what the left is doing in the streets and i don't want any threats or negative things going
towards the agency i just think that we i'm going to get through this one way or another
all right we'll leave it there but kudos to you for standing up for your beliefs lucas dozer thanks
for joining us today thanks for having me again my pleasure there goes lucas again no surprise
that that's how hollywood reacts that's how they handle people coming into the industry
not even established actors who come out and god forbid express conservative beliefs i guess
once they get to a beachhead where they're actually successful then they have some level
of protection but for them to be this i rate this intent on not even allowing people with
conservative opinions to get in the industry in the first place as obviously they tried to do
that's the incredible aspect of this story that i wanted to bring to people's attention
we got a few minutes left here though so let's dip into some final news stories zero hedge reports
home depot panics over millenials forced to host tutorials on using tape measures and hammering
nails millenials are such crybabies that they're obviously they've spent a lot more time being
offended over people using the wrong pronouns and things like that that they don't have
basic life skills it mentions mopping the floor most of them don't know how to mop a floor and
now home depot another businesses like that are starting to freak out they're actually putting
out how to videos on how to mop floors use tape measures and hammer nails this is an actual
business concern from home depot from scott's miracle grow as well who point out in this
article that a lot of millenials don't know that plants need sunlight to grow or they die
the millenials don't understand that they're keeping their plants in their basement or wherever
and they're all dying because they've got no idea about basic biology or how to use a tape measure
or how to how can how can anyone not know how to mop a floor this is literally like baby level
skills but they're freaking out about it they're having to put out all these how-to videos to
train people the most basic of basic skills what does that tell you about this generation
the anti-trump late night comedy lineup keeps plummeting this is an article out of
Washington Examiner and they point out that while America was laughing at Twitter and
watching YouTube videos late night was slipping and again this is the point I got into in the
previous segment Hollywood is losing money they're hemorrhaging their audience because again
these movies these TV shows have been turned into political weapons when the primary focus
is identity politics virtue signaling and amplifying leftist political dogmas they lose focus of
their primary role what it should be which is to make entertaining content I mean look at Steven
Colbert every single night Trump this Trump that I mean you expect a bit of it yeah but it's just
relentless anything he does anything he tweets and it's quite nasty of course with Steven Colbert
he isn't writing most of it but it just shows you the people behind the scenes are jumping on this
train you've now got Hollywood producers you've got TV executives telling them that they're not
being political enough that Americans should have more of this ram down their throats it's not
working people are turning out in droves tuning out in droves I should say writing in the Federalist
Ben Dominic points out that the late night viewership of ABC CBS plus NBC this week barely
broke 8 million viewers combined not long ago retired NBC funny man Jay Leno was bringing in 6 million
viewers all on his own what caused the networks comics to start flopping obviously the generational
demographics and technological developments can't be discounted millennials don't watch as much
television but again some of it is due to virtue signaling because then if you look at the news
channels Sean Hannity is kicking their butt people are tuning out and it's not the sole reason
obviously Netflix or their options YouTube are a big part of it but they're tuning out because
they're getting jaded with this relentless politicization of comedy of sports of movies of
music of entertainment and the quality is declining the quality is noticeably declining people are
tuning out of course over on YouTube you've got the late night comedy channels doing quite well
for themselves is the only beachhead that they've established on YouTube in terms of the left they
have Trump's tweet where he calls them out for not calling out the Harvey Weinstein scandal
early enough but over on YouTube you've got these late night comedy channels Jimmy Kimmel
Stephen Colbert etc doing quite well for themselves now could that be anything to do with
the fact that YouTube has afforded them a top tier partner status level where they can't
be demonetized and where they're getting pushed up to the number one trending spot almost every
time Jimmy Kimmel comes out with his rent on Las Vegas it gets less views than other videos that
were released exactly the same time but it goes to number one on trending that's not pure algorithm
that's somebody cultivating and selecting that to become number one just like Facebook got caught
selecting their trending news topic to shove out conservative topics to silence conservative voices
it's a completely rigged game but Americans are getting sick and tired of it you've seen what's
happening with the NFL they're really starting to turn off because they're sick of this relentless
polarization this relentless shoving down the throats of leftist narratives when at the end of
the day they just want to turn all that off they just want to be entertained that's going to wrap it
up for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show war room is coming up breaking news at info wars.com
