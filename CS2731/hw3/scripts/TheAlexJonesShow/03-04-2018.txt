Well, Info Wars is in the middle of one of the biggest news stories.
In the news cycle for the last week, and I don't say that as if I'm happy about that.
I don't say that.
Oh, and Troyer riding shotgun here with me like I'm happy about that.
I am very, very, very upset this is going on because we see Apple moving to communist
China saying they're going to merge with the government to be state run because they can
be tax exempt.
That's in Reuters.
That's in AP, but they report it like it's boring.
This is just sensational.
We've got the other telecoms and other big tech giants saying they're going to line up
with China.
So they can have entry into the market.
So that's what's happening right now, Owen.
And Info Wars is in the middle of just absolutely giant, massive censorship.
And what's crazy is I'm going to go through this today is I've talked to some people that
work at YouTube that are pretty high level.
Those are obviously off record.
They've gone in and looked at the accounts and they say the problem is YouTube gives
too many people access, Google does to the people that work at YouTube.
And so there are tens of thousands of people that have access.
And you've got SJWs that as an act of rebellion, just like deep state won't do what the president
says, even though it's constitutional or won't follow laws, there is a mutiny inside YouTube.
Now that's what Bloomberg said on Wednesday.
That's what the Verge said on Wednesday.
That's what we said.
And I'm giving the Verge and Bloomberg credit because their reporters went out and actually
found out what was going on.
They found out what was happening.
And they reported that indeed we had been wrongfully terminated, blocked, frozen.
The account was frozen one step from being deleted with two strikes and that thousands
of others had.
I mean, mainline famous preachers, liberals, centrist, any liberals like Sarkat of Akkad
or Sarkan of Akkad were very popular who said, hey, I'm a liberal, but don't ban conservatives.
He got banned.
Mike Adams of Natural News.
He's still currently banned.
Dr. Jerome Corsi of InfoWars.
He got banned.
Nothing to do with the Parkland shooting.
Thousands of accounts show that's one group is they're saying there's a rebellion inside
because they hired the Southern Barbery Law Center.
You can't make that up.
Come up and run it.
We're going to cover all this.
But the other school of thought is no, they're playing Operation Crying Wolf and that they're
claiming it's rogue employees, but they're just banning and unbanning and blocking and
striking people until we all just get tired and then it's a non-story because it is a
big deal to have a purge.
We'll have it be an on purge and off purge.
You know, it's the old thing of World War One.
They started going over loudspeakers, the German first.
The Austrian-Hungarian Empire would say, don't run.
You know, we've stopped fighting.
Just lay down your arms.
We're not going to attack you.
And then they would kill them when they came over the top.
And they kind of memorialized that as a fictional account.
But it was a real historical battle in saving Private Ryan where the GIs about to kill the
German with the bayonet.
And the German goes, no, no, no, no, friend, friend, stop.
And the American stops when he has the initiative for just a second for the German to flip him
over and run the knife into it.
And so the smarter money and some of my Army intel buddies I talked to this morning, they
and some CIA folks, they think that this is a rebellion going on, but they're doing it
over and over again until we just get tired and give up.
And then CBS, everybody else who'd admit that this was happening, they came out today
and said is Jones lying his YouTube's up and he's uploading new videos well
that's because in the last nine days eight days and nine days they have put
five strikes on four we have copies of one just disappeared and then we had
three strikes yesterday and I was told well three strikes usually in a few
hours or a day it'll roll over you're deleted I was told that by a source who
could look into our account but he couldn't change it because he was in a
different a division of YouTube but he was high level in marketing but he
wasn't one of the moderators and so he said yeah you'll probably be gone at
least by tomorrow I reported that we had three strikes I'll show you the three
strikes from internally in the control panel but then suddenly those are gone
but then they come back for the same videos again so oh and shroyer we're
going to break but in your gut what do you think's happening of the two
scenarios are there other scenarios I think that there's that and I think
there's one more scenario where you have people reporting our videos and flagging
our videos saying we said they're Christ actors so they strike it and then
YouTube goes and reviews the videos they find out that we never said that and
then whoever flagged that video lied about it so then they reinstate the
video because they lied about what we said they're just keep reflagging yes
basically because it's the same videos well the right button

experience the power of secret 12 at info wars life dot com that's info wars
life dot com big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to
stop tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex
Jones well the United States is in the biggest censorship in its history not
just by statistical magnitude because there's more people alive today than
we're a hundred years ago or 200 years ago but I've studied history we're in
the biggest censorship we've ever seen and it is modeled after the Communist
Chinese and Owen shroy arrived shotgun with me here info wars dot com anchor and
host as well investigative journalist we're right in the middle of it at
the Wall Street Journal met with Google Facebook and Twitter the CEO of news
core that runs the Wall Street Journal I should say said we're going to start
with WikiLeaks Alex Jones and ISIS and we're going to ban those and set the
precedent and then within a year there'll only be about a hundred providers
online of on Facebook Twitter Google YouTube all of it and we'll make a lot
more money well I saw that and people had derivative headlines that said hold
on to your genfoil hat YouTube's coming for Alex Jones well about a week and a
half later it happened all the fake strikes and here's the key they are
setting the precedent with us because they think that there's enough people
that hate us that somehow they'll just accept getting rid of free speech but
once they've set the precedent it's for everybody so we've got huge
developments this is one of the biggest stories thousands of articles the last
week hundreds and hundreds and hundreds in the first few days when it kicked
off before that so I mean we're talking the last week and a half since this
kicked off thousands and thousands of articles and if it wasn't for drudge
report calm info or is this big our affiliates are big and it was going to
be a big story but it wasn't for drudge who for a week when no one else picked
it up wrote about it and linked to it every day because he supports free
speech we would not have gotten this big breakthrough so CNN starts lobbying nine
days ago to take us down in three articles and two TV reports we showed
those to you you can pull them up CNN info wars is two strikes away from being
banned and they said we initiated it we're calling for the videos we take it
down I've talked to the antitrust lawyers towards the center we we have
them the thing is they have so much money and the globalists don't care they
think they're gonna have the country sewn up the next year before we went in
court that's why this every lawyer we talked it goes oh my god this is this
is open and shut but see they don't seem to care so I get your take on that oh
and these this other big news concerning new Nash saying they found evidence of
massive Hillary collusion they're gonna seek a major investigation and so
that's all coming up Devon you know drops the Moab of the Russian
investigation claims there's evidence of collusion but Owen you're gonna be
hosting yourself the special reports you're on the street covering any for
this weekend you're gonna be taken over the second hour but yeah all I can say
the listeners is this this is so huge because because you have CNN saying ban
info wars and then we can go into our control panel on our YouTube channels
that have over three billion views on our channels almost two billion on the
main on on the main channel and of course billions others on other channels
that we let carry our material it's all copyrights free free to air just just
get it out there folks and my head spins because they then came out and had a
bunch of sponsors that never sponsored us the UN Nike all these groups go
spend 20 to 160 dollars that was their biggest sponsors and then we only get
like a third of that or something only for like a week they went and sponsored
us on Google which anybody can do and then so they could all announce they
were pulling after CNN called them Friday so that's a big national headline
look at the CNN pushes YouTube to ban Alex Jones he monetized video channel
Breitbart daily caller company suspend ads on Alex Jones info wars YouTube
channel up for CNN contacts them now I'm reading them because they're real news
and actually quote real quotes and quote us and get the facts you want
thousands of others it's CBS New York Times Washington Post it's this idea
that I'm being destroyed that everyone's leaving me that I'm gonna collapse I've
never had the UN sponsor us I've never had Nike I've never had it suddenly they
were all this week we could go into the content of the fact I'm checking with
YouTube to see if it violates rules of service because I think it does that's
what's getting the advertisers issues and how much they're spending they've
already published all this so I can say what they've published I'm talking to
lawyers tonight that's one reason I'm going off early so I'm not going to
violate people's privacy like YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and and the
Southern Poverty Law Center hoping run this for YouTube and CNN I mean CNN is
in my account they brag about it the Southern Poverty Law Center has been
hired by Google for YouTube and they're in my life and then they run this stunt
where they go get a bunch of people to spend 20 is the smallest advertiser
160 for the week's the biggest they all put in like pennies to have their ads so
then they can pull them virtue signal and be in thousands of newspapers against
Alex Jones now that is a scam and they've done it and it's next level so I
asked the question earlier to you I'm told by our YouTube sources and the
media calls me let's give us your sources and I go no they go that's weird and I
go oh yeah the media never has secret sources but they told us that the day
before Bloomberg reported it last week and the day before the Verge got it
right YouTube apologized on Wednesday saying we're sorry a lot of
conservatives got banned because the new moderators we hired from the Southern
Poverty Law Center 10,000 of them and jump at any time Owen it's just that my
head spinning and then they put our channel back then they pulled it back
down so I'm gonna go over coming up the history with the actual strikes that we
printed off here so that people can see for themselves because the new thing Owen
since they removed the strikes again today after putting them back again
yesterday for the fourth or no fifth time is that now it never happened Owen
because they failed to ban us and because YouTube managers came in and
lawyers said you can't do this he didn't say what you said we're wide open for
lawsuits anti-trust horses interference unfair business practices racketeering
they're now saying and I have reporters calling me saying show us the strikes we
don't believe you so CNN's up there they're in thousands of publications
celebrating our channels got one strike then two then three headlines it's
about to be taken down hooray we blew up the Death Star Owen and then when they
fail they say we made it up Owen I've got all the articles I can't even compute
what this is are they putting strikes in removing them so it sounds like we're
crying wolf or is it the mutiny like the people told me and what Google says when
we broke the day before Google said no we've got people muting inside a civil
war in Google controlling YouTube or is it that people keep putting fake strikes
and so it's automated and kicks back through but our channel is not automated
because it's a partner not just a regular partner a partner partner with
YouTube which they don't want me to talk about one back eight years just will try
to embarrass YouTube big deal I'm a news organization CNN's partnered with them so
I mean I get a lot of the inside baseball I just don't leak it out there
because it's private information what the hell do you think's going on Owen well
I actually think it's it's all of that and there's a bigger agenda to create an
environment of thought that you're losing that you've been defeated it's the
same type of stuff they do whenever you have to go to court for legal stuff or
with your family they say oh Alex Jones family's abandoning him you know I had to
hear that yesterday on the streets I'm like that's not true at all Alex spends
a ton of time with his kids I mean so so they want to I have my I have my
children my four children if you average together 75% of the time no no no
no this one my newborn baby I got a hundred percent of the time since it's a
math I have my three children 75% of the time and then I have my newborn baby
well she's now 10 months old God time flies 100% so what's 75 if I have the
three and then how do you average in the other one it's that's like 85 90% like
that something I have my children 90% of the time but that's but that's what they
do they create this environment of thought where people think you've been
defeated they think you've lost oh you've been banned from YouTube you said
there were crisis actors oh you lost your kids and it's all fake it's the
same thing it's all pseudo but Alex I have to tell you it was deja vu today for
me and I don't know if you remember this but last Sunday we you started the
broadcast kind of the same way and you actually said something last Sunday it's
probably one of my favorite quotes my favorite moments ever of the Alex Jones
show you come on air and you're like you know I feel sick because we're getting
banned they're trying to censor us I feel sick and then and then you go but at a
fleshly level I want them to ban me at a fleshly level it's almost like sweet
victory that they can't defeat us so they have to ban us and they're only
going to make us bigger so as the more they ban us the more they strike us the
more the audience supports us the more people go to the Alex Jones channel the
more people go to info wars.com so it's this weird thing we're like well
exactly I want them to do the right thing it hurts me they're banning us I'm
being corrupt and evil and working with the Communist Chinese and Southern
Barber Law Center but at a Machiavellian level I'm like don't you
idiots get it exactly and that's where we are right now so they can try to stop
the First Amendment and that's what they want to do but they're gonna show their
face and people aren't gonna like it I just can't believe it's gotten this
crazy over a year in the making produced by one of the top organic firms in the country that if you

well I know this they can try to ban us they can call us lies any semitics they
were sexually assaulting people with no proof they can make up whatever they want
the last week they can try to take our sponsors away they already took them all
away so then they have big corporate sponsors come back and become sponsors
for a week as a stunt so they can pull their support and then they spent like
$20 $50 $160 hundreds of big names so they could be listed virtue signaling
that they pulled away from info wars they already when Trump won demonetized
us 97% for about six months we used to bring in about $40,000 a month on
YouTube that's in the top 10 to 1% and that wasn't that much money to fund our
operation total and then they cut it down to about $3,000 a month and that
hurt them so bad with thousands of conservative libertarian channels that
they went to about 70% demonetization now but it's all regional patriots that
are advertising and second amendment groups and universities and and and other
organizations came and filled the gap but then to have them have these
simulated victories I was trying to explain to my 15 year old son how this
works he finally got it I was saying son they want to have this illusion that
we're falling and if you're associated with us you're gonna go bankrupt to
intimidate everybody else that if you stick your head up and you're for the
second amendment we're gonna destroy you and listen it's not just me they tried
to take down the NRA they're trying to take away their banking they're trying
to say they they don't have a right to commerce that's serious racketeering that's
serious oppression I was talking to Ted Nugent at his house I was there about
three hours and we're gonna play some clips of this coming up the next hour
to sneak peek so the amazing two plus hours of interviews we have and I've
met him before about the crowded situation and he's been on the show
probably 50 times the last 18 19 years I've been on there 23 years but I'm gonna
talk about that right now because Ted was telling me off record no I'm not
gonna say what he said oh and off record but but he's he said on record and if we
don't have that clip today you can play that tomorrow in your house things I'm
taking a few days off you about children for spring break I had a spring break he
told me he said yeah he goes I don't need any money obviously yeah I sold 50
million records or whatever but he said I give a lot of my money to charity this
and that you know as you know and he said but before Trump got elected they
were bringing in large amounts of money every year and he's more popular than
ever that's what's popular is the evergreen you know famous stars and
going out and playing that's only money in music and he said but as soon as he
continued to back the NRA the last year that you talk about a sacrifice I mean
the sacrifice he's making is is is unbelievable because he gave me the
numbers and he was telling me about it and and sometime he said if they don't
fix it soon he's gonna go public because it is racketeering and I told Ted I
said you need to go public the fact that we've done this has made him back off
quite a bit but this is savage bullying going on against the American people and
it's got to stop it's like they'll hit you in the head if you got a mag I had on
with a bike lock or whatever and the media or they'll shoot cops you know
black lives matter or antifa and then CNN says well cops are bad so this is
justice some random cop gets killed because maybe a cop did something bad a
thousand miles away this is terrorism and when I got up here 20 minutes ago on
air and I started the show saying communist China has allied with the big
tech firms to help censor and they're moving their headquarters over there
Apple is and giving the iCloud keys you read the article to the Chinese
government because the Chinese government offered them zero tax remember
Trump lowered our deal from 40 to 15 they just went to zero they've made the
deal and they said they're gonna help police the internet from China and that
this week they took Easter off the calendar a month before Easter and said
no Christianity's basically bad pull that up I mean if I'd have heard this 20
years ago even with my brain I wouldn't have believed it Owen this is the big
push this is the big launch to see what they can get away with and because people
got upset they go oh it's a mistake oh we didn't mean it but they don't
coordinate CNN's flogging saying we called all the sponsors to get them
removed when they guaranteed geared up the stunt of having them go advertise
with no real money to run this I mean when you understand they're given over
to total fraud they're given over to total lies and then you get angry drudge
gets angry everybody links test being banned so they reinstate the channel pull
the channel off reinstate the channel pull it off Bloomberg calls and Google
goes no this is mistaken Rogan poise then they take us off again
Owen shroyer what would you call this period of history because the psych
warfare chiefs are trying to make things as confusing as they can well there's
never been more of a centralized control over media and content and opinion so
what you have is I mean there's a reason why info wars is the most bad-ass news
organization on the planet there's a reason why they hate us there's a reason
why they want us banned so you have this huge pushback and you have this huge
awakening this this resurgence of America this resurgence of humanity but
the power structure and the establishment and the centralized control
cannot allow that to happen that's what they're so afraid about they're afraid
of competition they're afraid about somebody reporting on the unethical
business practices of Apple I mean my god the unethical business they own the
worst factories it's one thing to work somebody 14 hours in you know a sweat
shop that's bad enough but compared to other people starving outside in
Guatemala you know they're happy to be there because I've been to some of the
sweatshops and covered it Mexico in places okay yeah it's rough but it's
kind of what America went through you know 100 years ago in the jungle T.S.
Elliott or I forget I read the book everybody wrote at the point is is it
exactly 18 hour work days till their fingers bleed forced abortions they put
them on drugs to control them and they have suicide nets in the hallways and
around the buildings because someone will commit suicide I and if you speak up
they execute you and then they'll give you a phone and when they release a new
phone two years three years later they make that phone obsolete they which we
always knew and my phone works great but the new one came out suddenly it's
ten times slower and then it came out they make it ten times slower and so how
is I mean where are the lawsuits against Apple but this is but see that's
what I'm saying this is why they have because they virtue signal and fun
black lives matter and get it to all fight with each other it's all just a
cover this is why they have to ban you because you're gonna report on this this
is why they have to ban our videos because we're gonna report on this I
forgot the number I saw a report between Apple and Amazon and Facebook and
Google they bought like some like $550 billion worth of businesses in the last
calendar year or something so they're going for full control and they all
paid zero tax and they're going for full control okay they're going for full
centralized power full sense they're bigger than the government and then
Google's bigger is in the top 10 GDPs in the world okay it's bigger than most
governments okay it's in the top 10 GDPs so there is a there is a civil war
inside because they are reinstating it because they realize we can win lawsuits
but that's only for now when they bring in the full authoritarianism it's over
so here's a story they got Apple Amazon Facebook Google spent 50 million to
influence US government 2017 that's just that's just money they spend on the
government I mean that's not even talking about all the businesses they buy to
just make Facebook bigger so they buy up all the competition and so what are you
Alex your competition your competition to CNN your competition to MSNBC your
competition to Fox your competition to ABC your competition to CBS all of that
but you're not under their control you're not owned by news that's again
they wouldn't care about this competition reaching this level was told the
party line they're upset because we'll actually read and go it's no big deal
when you work in China you put government officials over your company
and you give them access to the data it says that in Reuters China the government
is getting access to all your Apple IDs they're moving over there we will point
out points they don't want being discussed and have a big enough epicenter
to then get it out and have it break big or we'll play a video that's just
someone else's report saying I think there were multiple shooters or I was
walking with Nicholas Cruz after the event we just play that video and they
can't even stand that because no one else is doing it on TV so info wars can't do
it shut them down and we get contacted by the reporters from the station says
they won't air this will you exactly we're not controlled that's why they hate
us introducing floor life the new probiotic line developed exclusively by
info wars life after years of research on the human microbiome not all probiotics

wives tales in every culture we know that the bones have the essence we know
chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick again in every culture this

of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible ladies and gentlemen

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
here's the answer the social engineers bet that we're stupid bet that we're
easily entertained and that we could have a giant internet DARPA controlled
grid the web that would control us and track us and we never use it tax to get
our freedom back but they miscalculate so now they're just flooding the web with
all this disinformation all this fake news all this petty garbage in a hope
that people get overwhelmed with informational overload and they can
just come in and say we're gonna fix all this for you we're gonna start
censoring and stopping people that say no children died and that you know no
shooting happen that they're all child actor crisis actors but we never said
that but once they set that precedent you get you to go well I'm for free
speech but not for those bad guys they want so I got a bunch of other issues I
want to get to a bunch of ribbiting footage of anti-futaking our reporters
last week and yesterday and being arrested here in Austin and all of it but
I also promised a lot of news I've had a lot of news email and people have got my
cell phone call and they say prove you even have strikes again it's all about
the stain for their readers they know they failed to ban us so far so I'm
back and forth at least four times them banning us unbanning us just on YouTube
them calling for our sponsors to be taken seeing and having pieces about it
Skelter Dan rather Jordan Kepler went on to his show all of this and now they
just say oh we didn't do it so I have to show people the actual strikes just for
the record and our listeners are like what do you mean it's been all over the
news they think you have the memory of a goldfish they say the average person has
one shorter a goldfish is eight seconds the average person is three seconds
below about 30 doesn't mean everybody's like that you can train your mind back
to not be like it but they think you're out of sight out of mind so let me go
over some of these headlines for you jump in any time Owen CNN pushes YouTube
to ban Alex Jones to monetize video channel the best article from Breitbart
he has Skelter saying just a year ago in an op-ed never since her people even if
you don't like them it's up to the courts the side of his defamation then it has
him quoted saying shut down Alex Jones he's pollution when they're talking
about how I said no kids died with hog on there agreeing to it all companies
suspend ads on Alex Jones in fours YouTube channel up for CNN contacts them
CNN says they're doing all this yeah there why are they behind the scenes
doing this what is up with that these people are freaks man well then I have
reporters call me they got you claim CNNers and I go I send them three
articles no article AP called me about this last week I sent them the art I sat
there send them I like okay we'll get back with you thank you no story you
don't think I'm sorry I wouldn't be shocked if Brian Seltzer is sitting at
his computer just flagging in fours videos all day long we know it's Phil
mud of the CIA and he says he's gonna kill Trump a fake it doesn't want me to
say hey you can't say you're gonna kill the president so that there's like
there's this is just the top 10 we printed YouTube it's info wars with
third strike of free speech birds goes viral personally to that we at that time
we had three strikes you're supposed to be banned sometimes it rolls over the
next day and it happens my source said yeah they're there you'll probably be
banned the next four hours yeah we couldn't even upload a video this has
happened four times last week but they said we're banned advertisers are pulling
ads from Alex Jones show YouTube channel and that's meant to get people
locally to hear it on AM and FM and think oh I'll do the same but then again
they're the most of them never advertised or just advertised this week the
smallest advertisement $20 just so they could pull in virtue signal and see
it admits they cook the whole thing up but but really how is it how I mean this
is like you go into a restaurant order a cup of coffee because you on the
restaurant across the street just so you can say to the paper I found a roach leg
in my coffee and then you go put the roach in the coffee of course yeah but
but how is this not illegal think about it Alex they whoever it was flags the
videos no singing in says they did and then said and then where they say they
say that info wars says that David Hogg is a crisis actor or info war says that
they're all crisis actors but we never said it and so now that's what permeates
though that's what gets out into the to the mainstream and then that's the
excuse to in free speech when thousands of other conservative accounts were banned
Christian account or Facebook YouTube Twitter no one's even they're just
talking about us but it's a big story is the big story is big story is and I've
read this in the trade publications before Ted Nugent would sell out 50,000
20,000 10,000 person in smaller town arenas everywhere he's a best-seller they
told him all the bit the three big concert companies you denounce guns and
leave the NRA and we'll let you be number one because people love him and
they love that genre and he says no so it's costing him I'm not gonna say the
number but again people say well he's already rich the point is if they can
get him they can get us all continuing as advertisers flee Alex Jones claims
his YouTube band will come today Gizmodo so Gizmodo's been cheerleading the day
before info wars is about to be banned was their headline but see now oh he
claims so when you report on it it's fake news when they report on it yes
major when you have three strikes your band but instead it just sat there
because I guess they have a hold on the account as they know their own employees
are going in and doing it even though it's not true this is major brands express
concern after YouTube runs their ads on Alex Jones channel and again they've got
ad buyers that put their ads in for the PR stunt these people never advertise
with us yeah I just I find it I found a cockroach in your coffee shop sir yeah
we have Alex Jones holding info words at YouTube's community standards is the
first step towards me being arrested and killed media matters that's what they do
yeah first they silence you then they demonize you then they arrest you then
they kill you yeah that's how it works and that's my that's any leftist death
cult advertisers ask that YouTube to pull ads from Alan Jones CBS news and the
CBS goes on to say no one's pulling in he has no strikes this is when the channel
was shut down yesterday didn't exist so see it's next level they're banning us
but it's not happening well it's almost like now they don't even know what to
report because it's because YouTube's going back and forth so now they're
they're reporting Alex Jones is banned and then you're banned and then they
lift it and you're back and they're like well what happened I he lied he is the
bad guy pull your ads play everyone's pulling their ads from the failure Alex
Jones it's all happening advertises for info words founder Alan Jones YouTube
channel money CNN and they're the ones in another article running it white
mark documents this they're the ones running it and then again that's March
3rd that's yesterday but CNN pushes YouTube to ban Alex Jones demontizes
video 20 a Century Fox Paramount Network pull ads from info wars Alex Jones
says YouTube will delete info or show yeah we had three strikes shitting there
and we talked to one of the people YouTube they said yeah I guess it hasn't
rolled over yet deleted you advertisers pull out of info words YouTube
channels edge net dozens of the legal of leading brands pull ads from far
right dispersing YouTube channel they're just having a simulated victory over us
Alex Jones claims YouTube account to shut down info or channel on and on on
international business times Alex Jones YouTube channel running advertisers of
brands without their knowledge oh without their oh without their knowledge
they went and advertise this week they have PR advertising agencies that made
the buys you know what I've got the internal stuff we screen I'm just gonna
put it out that's it you came and requested it so you could then pull out
it's like a woman that asked you to have sex with her and she claims right that
they came these brands came and bought on my channel even though I don't control
it YouTube let them rape me Nike rape me the UN rape me you all rape me because
I wouldn't take your advertising you rape me and you say I raped you I'm gonna
say it Nike raped me all these that they raped me they came and advertise just so
they can say they pulled out and I raped them no you rape me and this is the same
company that 20th Century Fox rape me Expedia rape me all the now the Mormon
Church just said they didn't know they were on there all this stuff National
Rifle Association now that this is incredible go ahead well I can actually
I'm starting to kind of see the tea leaves now that you just went down that
by the NRA did it has been advertised for for off and on for years they're a
sponsor but they didn't pull see they they also didn't say everyone's pulling
then they mixed in names that didn't pull lies on lies on lies on lies is a lot
I mean what the hell this is the next level well Nike's the same company that
promoted kneeling during the National Anthem but actually I think I think I'm
actually starting to see what they're what they're doing to you here it's just
like the gay frogs thing where whenever we go out somebody has to yell gay
frogs and it's a pseudo you lost your kids you lost your advertisers gay
frogs that's that's what this is I'm not really sure what the final agenda here is
but they want to trick you and trap you and put out some sort of fake narrative
so that they're all their minions in the streets this is gonna be their new
thing like oh you were purged from you said you were banned from YouTube but
YouTube never banned you like that'll be the new thing they're they're trying to
groom their their street minions there's a casting how to ban free speech so
they'll they'll ban you and you'll be banned and you'll report on your band
they'll have all these magazines and news articles about how you're banned and
then they'll lift it and then we'll go out in the street say they'll be like you
said you were banned fake news you're not banned we're not hitting you in the
head with bike locks for aiming guns that's it we're not calling for killing
tops gay frogs you know gay frogs

you're listening to the alex jones show
if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
info wars comm studios it's alex jones you know one of the producers matt was
pointing out that info wars is a wild card they don't know what we're gonna
say that what we're gonna do they know we're not controlled by them they know
there's eyewitnesses or reports the hostage rescue team gave us intel about
the gun running and how he was meeting with a muslim group and that's pretty
much all come out now and in Vegas so they're scared that we're a conduit that
will tell you Hillary's having convulsions every 45 minutes the secret
service told us she has a black ambulance and then we should just follow
her she's gonna fall down our reporters caught her collapsed for an hour a week
before and Cleveland Ohio but didn't get him running over the stretchers and
everything but the next week then somebody else caught her falling down in
New York so that's what they're scared of just like they're scared of you that's
why websites are getting rid of the mainline newspapers get rid of the
comment sections and everything because they don't want you interacting on well
who was it that reported that the real Russian collusion was with Hillary
Clinton years ago that was info wars now it's coming out see they can't run
their little psyops and by the way how do we know it's already out there with
FBI investigations and again New York Times articles in 2015 the mainstream
media used to do some journalism and some fake news to act credible they've
just gone full line now we only know all this stuff because it was in the New
York Times in 2010 and 2015 we know about fast and furious because the CBS
Cheryl Atkinson got the documents where they said ATF agents go we're getting
people killed they go we're gonna get the guns yeah but she got fired that's
what I'm saying they've completed the purge of real journalist from mainstream
media they didn't used to be this bad so how easy would it have been for the
media to destroy Trump and keep him out of office if it wasn't for info wars it
would have been really easy who who goes to the rallies I mean seriously who else
goes to a Trump rally and then put the microphone in front of a Trump protester
hundreds of times you're gonna play that next hour because I was told by two
YouTube executives that are more libertarian there's really no conservatives there I
mean I'm a libertarian myself and by that they're just not socially you know on
a witch hunt or whatever they're officially conservative and like you
know having freedom of ideas they just don't agree with some of the more left
of stuff they told me they said you know what they're pissed about right it's what
they keep beating yeah and they said it's people like Owen shroyer they're
blocking those videos when Owen's average video it's like a million views it
would have been like 10 million and they're scared because it shows how
crazy mainline Democrat rallies are so next hour you're gonna play some of the
these that have like 10 million views 3 million views that would have had more
they're scared of you buddy and then what happens to that that's why info wars
is so powerful is it becomes like a rock thrown into a pond and then there's
this ripple so there's so there's the info wars channel and the Alex Jones
channel and we get the millions of views on that and then our audience takes it
and they cut it up and they make a remake and they do a remix and they do a
music and there's no way to gauge it and they can't stop it they cannot stop it
unless they stop it at the source that's why they have to shut us down because if
we stop putting the content out there you know proprietarily then they don't
have that that chamber that ripple and the only folks that got it right was
Rolling Stone because they already cut our money off a year ago on YouTube and
wasn't that big to begin with and they already shrunk it down to nothing but
but but Rolling Stone said no he's using his main channels his feeder channels
for all the rest of the web not just YouTube and for young people that he
hasn't gotten tuned in yet I'm like okay bingo who's thinking of finally
something in MSN they're trying to destroy us and the article you know that
you could I think it's like a headline like you know the purge on YouTube is
bigger than Alex Jones and they say purge him but you know you're waking
folks up too much purging everybody else it's a very evil article but they
finally figure out something that we're already off YouTube they've already banned
this all over the place it doesn't matter because everybody grabs it and puts
it out everywhere else and so again if they cut it off at the source they they
they stopped that ripple effect we're just gonna put it on our own servers in
HD for everybody to copy but it's never gonna stop we were only getting a
couple hundred thousand views on those videos they banned one of you and one of
me the first we put them up on the website in two days seven million views
last time I checked it was 16 million views yeah if they want there's the
problem I had to pay like eight grand for that but that's what they don't
understand though it's like a it's like a double-edged it's like they're sick and
twisted because they do want to shut you down so they're really sick and twisted
evil can only think maybe one top evil generals maybe two two steps ahead we
can think 20 ahead exactly so they always go with the hate and that's ban
Alex censor Alex oh let's oh Alex how about this let's make a video of Alex
and let's make him look stupid yeah you're gonna stab your dog at the mall they
don't get a hundred million views they don't think how people go wow they're
demonizing these people we better see what they're saying I mean that when
when when I first discovered you it was my I was watching the news and I'm like
what this is fake this news I don't believe any of this stuff the FBI can't
find out who the Sarniv brothers are yet their their CIA assets they were
monitoring the guys travel back and forth and the media spends it Alex says the
police blew everybody up no criminal elements of our government Obama let
them do it and that came out later and then there's a drill the same day I mean
it's all the same they have this massive manhunt and then they can't even find the
guy and then someone walks out into his backyard and finds him in a boat and then
they're sitting in the shoot I mean you know we're going off on a tangent but
the point is they can't run their psyops they can't run their fake news they can't
run they can't start fake wars they can't elect they can't make you elect a
fake president when there is competition when there's real news out there but you
know what else I think that I think that why they've they've they've ramped it up
so much now is because your your impact you used to be lighting brush fires of
liberty now there's like it's just like the whole place is just burned with with
all the fires you started like all of their law it's hard I don't just say
this act like I'm humble it's the truth it's drudge report it's because I'll be
honest the other sites are wimpy and chicken most of them I mean drudges have
the courage and but now what drudge talks about we talk about is now on talk
radio they understand that we force the narrative over to reality we force the
needle way towards reality not that we're perfect we're trying to find reality
we're willing to say what really is going on and the listeners of the real
power let's let's be clear about the listeners they're the reason we're here
well what happens in 1984 just if there's just one individual they cannot
have one individual that thinks differently they cannot have one in a
world of universal deceit telling the truths the Revolutionary Act so imagine
here they are trying to create a 1984 civilization and they've got millions of
people that think differently they've got millions of people that go out to
Trump rallies listen to info wars go to drudge and they don't know what to do it
kills them it destroys them they want to smash us out with the big crazy here's
the thing that's what's such a good bright bar article is that they explain
here's Stelter saying he's pro-free speech you're going to not bed and here
he is saying Van Alex Jones he's pollution well I don't just use Nazi
analogies like everybody else does calling anybody that's for basic freedom
of Nazi that's what the Nazis did is they said you're pollution I mean then
they banned you that is that's how you dehumanize somebody Brian Stelter says
I've never said shut him off the air I've never said go to you know they're
bullying old ladies at seeing in at their houses you know go file complaints on
them people approached me about that and said let's use their tactics I'm not
gonna use their tactics I'm not a sack of garbage well look at look at the
history of the Nazis what did they do they staged false flags to blame their
opponents okay so you've got all these Democrats the operation Hemler to start
World War two they didn't attack Poland operation you know all those other
operations they launched the whole Reichstag fire so this is what the
Democrats do they staged violence at Trump rallies they caught on video Bob
Kramer got fired Aaron Black got got named they start stuff and then they
blame Trump supporters what else do they do they what else the Nazis do they
censored free speech they censored anyone that wouldn't go along with the
official narrative coming out of the official Nazi party that's what the
left is doing today and then they wouldn't let people be in commerce like
I'm doing the NRA and everybody else in us and then they blocked you out made you
live in a ghetto then they got you poor and under their control then they
started running up a few people at first and then more and more knowing how to
always just push push push so nobody pushed back and then pretty soon you're
in a ditch being marching to be shot in the back of the head or being marched
into a gas chamber and now let's bring it home if you go out on the streets
let's say you live in a big city you're listening in New York City right now if
you go out on the streets and you have a make America great again hat on a red
hat you will be attacked you're gonna be attacked you're gonna have coffee
thrown at you you're gonna have someone spit on you you're gonna have someone
attack you so I'm not trying to make any equivalencies here but the left has
been incrementally radicalized in these echo chambers that they claim we are and
they're out of control let me just ask for you to break speaking of the funding

you're listening to the alex jones show
waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live on the front
lines of the info war oh shroyer is my guest writing shotgun here on alex
jones info wars.com news wars.com
I've had a whole bunch of newspapers call me publications and want me to go
over this we're gonna do this in this little short segment so they can see
this on there instead of me having to email it out to a bunch of my told them
to tune in sometime today and then we're gonna come back I'm gonna go ahead I
think and host the rest of the hour with you but you've got a bunch of clips to
play a lot of critical information next time we'll play some clips of the head
of the House Intelligence Committee Nunez is coming out and saying they found
evidence of Hillary colluding well it's it's public I mean hell they Mueller
ordered it and Comey ordered it shut down so that's big that's next segment
but because we just joined us there's a big national move it's in thousands of
publications misrepresenting what we said calling for info wars to be shut
down calling for sponsors to be taken contacting sponsors trying to get rid
of them they won't bail on us so then they have on YouTube where you can go
with an ad agency and advertise as low as $20 you know part of the Internet ad
and then have people pull off saying oh look there's a consensus there's a wave
so it's fraud but I thought since we went over this I would give people some of
these dates here and go over some of these for TV viewers so they can see
them so document can please because the new thing is the strikes haven't
happened so document can please and I'll just show you here these are the
February 27th bands going back and then with one before that the truth about
crisis actors in the Florida shooting we said there weren't crisis actors they
were just anti-gun young people who clearly have been coached to put up this
message you know three thousand they've been picked what is the blame for the
Florida high school shooting they said that bullied children we said that was
psychotropic drugs and standout okay David Hawking remember his lines we just
say they're telling him what to say we'll say this on the video we're not
saying he's an actor though now they've gone on Bill Maher and chosen said they
are actors in our part of the acting department I'm not saying they're crisis
actors and work there it didn't happen they're just scripting so you know
they're parsing words here here's another one David Hawking remember his
lines were students coached after Florida school shooting we thought hey
let's change the name it's confusing folks when they brought that video back
it was the truth about crisis actors in Florida shooting we change it to that
saying you know let's not cause trouble because we never really said that let's
just go where they coached to make it even more accurate they banned that then
they reinstated it and as you can see that's March 3rd and then another one
hit yesterday on the 3rd and then there was just no notice it was just frozen
the account was frozen and they said there's a strike but nothing and then
that was removed by the time we got here to print it because I was interviewing
Ted Nugent and Waco yesterday when this happened but here's the community
guidelines strikes here's the explained happened to us here's a where they try
to I mean so there it is it's like it's five strikes in at nine days but four
that are planted and then again I've got the Verge and people just saying show us
proof there's even strikes I might use the search engine you morons it's all
over the news CNN's calling for us to be banned again these people are so servile
I'm telling you this is gonna be the next thing we deal with is going out oh I
thought you got banned if a war's got bad Alex George is bad you're not bad
you're fake news I can just see it now that's gonna be their new but then they'll
call for us get out of here I'll kick your ass yeah you gotta be shut down but
nobody's trying to ban you it's like yeah well we've got that I mean one of the
videos that we're gonna play here in the second hour is them literally saying
get out info wars get out Austin Alex shows can't be in Austin Texas and I'm
like wait I'll be I'll be at a shoe store my children's and they always like
mental patients I'll see them I go oh my god the wolf I go the black white old
young male and I go get out here Nazi and they like run off giggling it's like
I've seen it it's it's weird but you know what the on the on the other side of
the spectrum though even though you deal with the crazies that that looked
like they'd like to you know maybe stab you or something there's so many great
people that come up to us too I mean there's no no no 10 to one yeah but but
and they're like I'm always just happy when people want to shake my hand now
instead of attack me but speaking of this Ted Nugent's coming up with just a
few little explosive previews of the bombshell two and a half interview at
his home with his amazing wife who's they're both tuning in right now we love
the death Ted Nugent you think we've paid prices Ted hasn't even told about it

with the absolute top the real red pill this is a heart and brain pill a new
tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it but boy does it stimulate because
it's beyond that quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors
prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were
charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up
with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non-gmo made
right here in America 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen you add the
preglinone to it which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has
to have to even make the hormones in your glands it is amazing red pill now

Live from Austin Texas and the heart of the Resistance it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
That's Ted Nugent's last album he played some of his new album coming out and it
was as good as Tranglehold it was as good as Cat Scratch Fever it was good as
Free For All and right up there growing up you know Ted Nugent's one of my
favorite True Americana 50 million plus record sold I met him before and he's
been on the show I've been on there 23 years he's been on the show since about
18-19 years ago probably 50 times he's invited me to his house like 10 years
ago and it's not that I didn't want to go do but it's like Ted Nugent's inviting
your house outside Waco and you're kind of like okay and then he's invited me his
wife's amazing she's a listener you know we talk all the time off air and but to
go to his house and he drives the same black hellcat I do but he got one before
they came out that's 800 plus horsepower not 700 and it's like the same
interior that he chose everything it's like this is getting weird there's like a hundred
of these cars he's got 180 on the track yeah his cars like a souped up
hellcat I've got a regular one but the same black hellcat same interior that
we chose that like ten interiors it was like same hellcat same interior I was
like they told me only like three other guys got the same interior out of the
choices they got it Nugent's one there's one other guy so I'm like at his house
going okay this is getting really weird and as he's got this really humble house
you know his wife's amazing and he did more than 6,000 interviews in 2016 for
the president 6,000 he worked like 15 hours a day and he's so cool because he's
straight-edge he's never drank a beer he's never smoked marijuana he's never
done nothing he's 70 and I was he looked like he was about 50 and he kicked my
ass I mean he's not trying to act like a man he he doesn't look when
person though I mean we try to act you think you try to act all crazy when you
see him on teeth no he's a maniac well shoot I mean don't get me wrong I love
Keith Richards too but look at Keith Richards you know compared to Ted
Nugent well Nugent is a high Norse name of the Vikings that took over France in
England so I mean Nugent's a big Viking that's what he is anyways the point is
is that I'm not kissing his ass because people say oh I was a guy big of the
70s 80s and 90s whatever you know that's even bigger now on tour the only
music industry makes money is on tour and I happen to read trade publications so
I saw it Nugent sells out 20,000 seat deals consistently he can sell out 50
and bigger cities he is in the top 10 of folks you want to be on the trail because
all of his base ones come out he told me off record and a lot of stuff on record
I can say this you're gonna be able to have more of the clips tomorrow during
the show we've got like with all three cameras like you know six seven hours of
footage but two and a half hours of footage total on each camera he told me
what was going on showed it all to me tens of millions of dollars he's turned
down just the last year and a half since Trump got elected because they put up
with him before that but since Trump got in and he's on the intera they said
deny all this and turn against it doesn't matter you can sell out every arena
here and you are banned from touring he said Alex I've got seven kids 14 grand
kids what's all on video he said I don't care and it was so intense like I've
been around a lot of people who put off an aura been around Trump is why it puts
off an amazing aura around others but with Nugent the time I met him had a
cowboy hat on he was going to interview somebody we talked a little bit he was
kind of crazy and amped up because that was the enemy but the guy's like a living
jack-o'-lantern or something in a good way and he's like wild and he's not put
on an act he is wild he's the spirit of Americana that's why they hate him and so
we bet you about having our sponsors ban and them trying to kick us off YouTube
with our billions of views and all the lies and you know paying people they
admit paying people to taste credible acidine crap and oh man what we've
already discovered with our people on the ground this is gonna blow up that
Hillary lawyer's face big time but that's a side issue but to then I mean
his behind-the-scenes meetings with Trump that I can't get into we've got he
says Trump's totally when he goes to the you know anti-gun stuff and here's from
to show how radical they are when they call for the full ban and it I was
given all the inside baseball and I already knew it and I was given the NRA
inside baseball by the way that they brought in more members than ever
they're not being hurt by all the boycotts it's the lie but Nugent because
he's tied in the entertainment industry he's the only guy who they've he's given
up 40 million dollars the last year and a half oh I he didn't tell me that I
actually I miss quote excuse me I mean I'm think that's a nap that is awesome
that is he's a hero man I love Ted Nugent I love I loved his music and I
loved him and I love his spirit but being with him for three hours I mean I
knew Charlton Heston and he was a great gentleman a great patriot but
trowel told us was great but I'm telling you Ted Nugent is 1776 I got to tell
you that guy is being underutilized just like Chuck Norris who I know behind the
scenes is really a huge patriot but it's too humble to be the leader I mean Ted
Nugent is it well in the Ted Nugent example where he's being you know and
this is this happens on all industries hey who would turn down 40 million
dollars and he don't we say the names of the companies any of it he wants to work
it out I mean this guy he doesn't need it but I don't people that know him he is
one of the big he doesn't want to say that he didn't tell me this Nugent really
is a big big conservative bleeding heart Nugent gives something like a third of
his earnings to children and orphanages and real stuff he's the real deal he's
a maniac and so but they don't want to have him make a bunch of money right you
don't want that guy to make money because he likes the Second Amendment he
sells out I've already read about it before I would he who you're going to a
venue at 20,000 in Austin and his Ted Nugent a bunch of other Tommy it's sold
out he has one of the highest rating continual deals that he they he's banned
in America but this is what the entertainment industry has done they
have their liberals at the top a consortium authoritarian scum and so they
run the music industry the television industry the entertainment I mean it's
all of it the acting they they with computers deny the veterans health care
just let them die from operable stuff these people are our scum and they fear
anybody real and so they fear Ted Nugent and so they say all right you know what
Ted Nugent this is a guy you know what Ted we're more powerful than you buddy
we're not going to let you get that big show you're not going to earn that 40
million dollars this time around unless you want to come out and say the NRA is
bad and you want to disavow gun ownership and so Nugent gives him a big
fat middle finger and and Ted Nugent was like a six foot two elf I mean he looked
like like an alien dude I mean I don't mean that the bad way he looked like he
was totally real totally energetic none of it was fake and I felt powerful in
his presence I'm not people I don't BS I felt stronger in Nugent's presence as a
man that's 1776 baby but think about you know you know you know he was he's
proud they did this he doesn't care about that he's already you know so
successful 50 million records or whatever but just that's what we're
facing we're facing real authoritarianism we'll play the clips when we
come back sorry I'm gonna go ahead I'm just so damn honored to be in the to be
in the same league even though I'm not in the same you know strata I'm in the
same we're in the same league brother our listeners are we're in the league of
people that aren't scumbag criminals I mean that aren't authoritarians man I
mean this is the second American Revolution I mean these are the new
founding fathers I mean that's what Ted Nugent is that's what Alex we got some
of the video we were shooting bows he was hitting over and over again in a
pattern the size of a quarter and I'm good with a bow and I was shooting a
pattern like that I mean it's just I was sitting there it's just amazing you know
Ted Nugent though it's not the only one that's been blackballed like this you
know Ted Nugent isn't the only one that's been financially strangled like
this they do this any conservative in the music industry or in the you know
arts and culture industry but it makes us blood brothers that we've been through
this persecution because our forebears at Ticonderoga what drug giant guns 80
something miles I forget look up Ticonderoga these are the biggest guns
in the Western Hemisphere they were like tens of thousands of pounds and the
and their shoes were just old leather shoes they fell apart dragging them in
the last 20 miles it was blood everywhere and those guys were so strong
they draw this was some of our ships named Ticonderoga 1 2 3 because that
just means indomitable and they took them out and they took the big guns that
controlled the harbor and they hauled them back to use and I mean so yeah Ted
Nugent is great but like he said to me yesterday he said man we're together
manning Concord Bridge and he means it well you've got Anthony Sabato Jr. who
gets excommunicated from television because he's a conservative so he's
gonna run for for Congress exactly suppressing us only makes us exactly
and a top globalist once told me off record you will adapt to submitting no
we will adapt to conquering your ass and Stacy Dash just announced that she's
gonna be running for Congress as well another actress that gets blackballed
from the Hollywood industry because she's conservative so that's fine but
that but that is the answer don't by the way Owen you make me feel strong and
push back there's not a lot of you make me feel stronger well I'm a product of
of what you've done out no your positive your family history the point is we will
take the challenge we will win do you feel liberty rising out you sense that oh
that's why they're traveling their bridges that's exactly right let's eat

Florida Victor you're calling go ahead guess hi Alex first I just want to
mention if people just go and try the products they will be ordering all the
time I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing in
particular silver bullet I as soon as I start to feel like I get a little stick
you know maybe like a little raspiness in my throat I drop some silver bullet
and it like I'll still feel a little sick but it won't last as long and I just
ordered the body the alpha power and the pollen block well let me just say
something Victor it's people like you that then find the whole operation
because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very small
percentage of them by a lot of the products so thank you but when you
mention the the silver bullet colloidal silver it's got thousands of reviews a
98% review it is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab
in the country discounted high quality colloidal silver and it's not a silver
bullet that's the closest thing you're gonna find to a silver bullet you're
listening to the Alex Jones show
live raw and unfiltered by globalist propaganda it's the Alex Jones show
tomorrow's news today I've been doing this 23 years I don't claim any laurels
but I'm not out to get you and I could tell you I'm an American if you're
looking for the American resistance if you're looking for the people fighting
for free market fighting for religious freedom fighting for just what works what
we know is successful you found it you found it the tip of the spear oh and
shroyers here I'm gonna play the Ted Nugent clips that the editors just got
ready out of again if you do three hours almost three hours interview on
three cameras that's that's almost nine hours of footage we got two clips come
up the next segment you're gonna have a lot throughout the week as I promise to
take my daughters they particularly have never seen snow except for like maybe an
inch on the ground in Austin twice one of those 13 so I said I'm gonna take you
to snow so we're going to snow we're doing it and even if they shut
everything down I'm gonna leave you will hear like Colonel Travis at the Alamo
while I go gallivanting around my daughter's deserve a little time but I'll
be calling in and stuff but you deserve a little time to Alex I know wild horses
couldn't drag you well this is this is what I'm gonna do miss you my family
sitting around the house or you know swimming the swimming pool are going for
height no they want to see snow I get it there's that kind of that ancestral
memory going to the mountains but just during the four minute break I'm back
there in the coffee room getting a glass iced tea and we've got Fox News on and
it's saying Robert Mueller had we're gonna play in a moment Robert Mueller has
moved on from Russia gate to now investigating Saudi influence and
Chinese influence and and I'm gonna play the part about Saudi influence they go
and Trump's under criminal investigation I thought it was about Russians why did
Trump go to Saudi Arabia instead of Qatar or the UAE because Saudi Arabia runs
the whole Middle East except for Iran it runs 80% of Islam the Sunnis they were
the ones funding ISIS and funding the Democrats they arrested thousands of the
ruling class who were funding the deep state here Trump went there to cut the
funding off short of having a war with Saudi Arabia and the king was so blown
away with the president they're knowing everything office briefings with General
Flynn and other generals that sent Flynn whose names I'm not supposed to say
some of the former heads of the and presidents advisors I'm just letting the
deep state know I know all of it that was brought and then ISIS crumbled and
it helped Russia defeat ISIS in the US military that's how you do it why have a
war if you go to the Saudi King go I know you're threatened by internal
groups using ISIS to control you the Saudis some of them don't like to see
them they want to just you know be successful to not be radical Islam now
they're reforming women can drive cars women can have jobs her jibs may come
off Trump went and said you know I can overthrow you right now stop it and
this and then they made a deal that has been spun into being anti-American we're
gonna play the clip but I want what do you say to this well there's so much that
Trump is doing that is behind the scenes that people aren't aware he's smart
and and kind of like his entire campaign I mean this like you said you know he
goes off to us you don't think we're the only ones that get it I mean his dad was
a big John Berger so he's out you know he's in Scotland for a couple years he's
talking to his family about this and he's you know wargaming it out trying to
figure out you know when do I attack point a when do I attack point B we met
with a bunch of former generals and intelligence chiefs for six months at
least where do you think you know what though Alex they all flew into Scotland
since this is since Mueller is you know the one in front of this whole thing was
planned in Scotland you know Texas was founded by Scott's of course you know
William Wallace you know the great stories of patriots and liberty in
Scotland but you know there's kind of been a talking point of discussion who
is Mueller what is he really doing is he for Trump is he anti-Trump is he
actually gonna turn on Hillary in the end and this whole thing is kind of an
act to pretend like he's going against Trump and then he's gonna sell
everybody out in the end down the drain and this could all end up coming back
to 9-11 to Alex and a lot of experts are saying he's threatening to bring out
9-11 and then Jeff Bush quit so so exactly so you kind of got all of these
different angles that are just kind of like mott's balls just sitting there
stewing and you're really not sure what's going on and the worm is kind of
starting to turn and I figure based on studying President Trump and what he's
done when he said last week take the guns first do process second rightfully
so everybody freaked out you can't say that that that was meant to get us out
of our sleep because I read Trump weeks before was concerned we were asleep he
just woke our asses up of what they were doing but he knew if they said it we
wouldn't wake up they think he's too confident God you you weren't with
Nugent and he didn't want me to say all this on record part of it's coming out
tomorrow he'll talk about we're playing you just that was it was a wake up but
so but Trump is even willing to take the heat himself to get us to wake up oh and
you are and then remember Diane Feinstein like huh like a witch he goes and
like yeah look at that but do you get how Trump is he said if we're not worried
about Democrats we think he's so strong he will then say it to wake us up but
then what what is happening God is that not sophisticated and and what has
happened in the past every time and Feinstein can't even figure out what's
happening they don't even they literally can't get it that's the that is it
crazy I mean Adam Schiff gets prank called by Russians but but every time he
does something like this whether it be saying that Syria is chemically attacking
their own people and everyone freaked out about that any kind of drew back and
didn't go down that road didn't start the war in Syria he told me personally so
we're not going in a week later was in the news exactly he does the DACA thing
oh it will sign a one and a half million to people DACA okay that doesn't happen
he delivers how to take the piss out of war propaganda out of any anything they
build is a big PR campaign he goes I agree it dissipates and then he doesn't do
it and so I figure though based on if you study Trump like a like a roller
coaster like arches something big is coming so something huge is about to
Trump is going to reveal something or do something he just announced he's going
to be doing a rally in Pennsylvania Trump is about to reveal something huge I
think so let's go to this clip from Fox News like during the break is 10
minutes ago I'm watching this and now it's not Russian now he's a shoddy pawn
even though he literally cut their genitals off and made him roll over and
stop doing stuff it's bad for them everybody else and crushed ISIS well
just see it for yourself here we're Saudi agents we're all we're anyone's
agents but us to buy political favor or influence with the Trump campaign through
campaign money the businessman George Nader the Times reports was a frequent
visitor to the Trump White House in 2017 advised top Trump aides on Middle East
policy ahead of the president's visit to Saudi Arabia last year and Nader has
been a sort of advisor to one of the leaders of the UAE now the special
council is interviewing witnesses about Emirati influence and the president's
son-in-law Jared Kushner's family business ties to the Middle East we
could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the
Saudi side in this dispute between their 80% of Islam Mecca's based there they
run the whole thing they're running it so you go to who is in charge to stop it
like if you wanted to in World War two before it started you go to Hitler and
they have this buffoon like we don't this Democrat we don't hear you back it
up Tori had I think you guys back to the start there I mean oh and this is
Twilight Zone now well think about it just like Russia who was it there was
it was never Russia it was Saudi collusion but it what no we're gonna
arrest Trump for Saudi collusion but who actually colluded with the Saudis
okay you're gonna exactly so they take everything that Hillary he was there
cutting off their funding so does this once again though but does this does this
show I mean what is this show about Mueller does this show that Mueller is
covering for Hillary I mean what cuz that is just so weird I mean why all
the sudden is Mueller looking into Saudi Arabia like what's going on with that all
we know is why do you go to Saudi Arabia it's only the most powerful country in
the Middle East not Israel Israel has nukes but it financially Saudi Arabia
since when here's another incredible angle this wasn't even news people have
been colluding with Russia and Saudi well they call me the president under
the Constitution and make any deal he wants then if you want to impeach him
that's fine but he has that power or you don't have to ratify the treaty exactly
him going over and having them roll over this big victory now that becomes Saudi
collusion if the president communicates with anybody that's treason this is
bolder dash this is hotly bullpucky we'll be back with Ted Nugent exclusive

hey we don't put good faces on things unless they're good faces but I got to
tell you the fact that our people aren't easily bought or pushed around or
controlled and are dedicated to ideology and spiritual issues is our strength but
I want to play these clips for a go to Ted Nugent since we mentioned and we've
got some other clips that are critical here I want to go to trach out the
second special counsel maybe unavoidable and the big clip Devon Nunes who has
just been under such attack talk about another guy because I can imagine what
he's going through behind the scenes I can just imagine there's evidence of
Russian collusion with Hillary well we know that it's confirmed Mueller and
Comey separately ordered stand downs when she was Secretary of State under
Obama and when she was co-president back in the 90s of Bill Clinton so let's go
ahead and play first try gata here it is these witnesses have already left the
department which means the Inspector General does not have jurisdiction and
there are other agencies like the State Department where Michael Horowitz at DOJ
has no jurisdiction whatsoever Marie over the weekend I've counted up almost two
dozen witnesses that the Inspector General would not have access to were he
alone conducting this investigation so I think we're trending perhaps towards a
another special counsel because of this unique fact pattern and the fact that
there are witnesses outside the reach of the Inspector General so we should have
then you believe another how does one investigate itself frankly interested
time let's go to Devon Nunes chairman of the House Intelligence Committee here
he is with the bomb show there's evidence of Hillary colluding wait there's
evidence of ducks quacking there's evidence of bears doing you know what
next is gonna tell me that seals go or that fish from in the sea or the skies
blue on maybe the Pope wears a funny hat or something to yeah I don't know
that's a conspiracy theory here it is that pretty much can refuses to cover
this issue at all we have serious abuses that occurred with the in the FISA
court against the Trump campaign so we continue to get back we'll bring those
facts forward as as we see them and what I sent out a couple days ago was a
letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and to Mr. Horowitz the IG pretty much
updating him on where we are in our investigation and what they should be
looking at as it relates to FISA abuse so I was I was happy to see Attorney
General Jeff Sessions appoint Mr. Horowitz because we welcome more people
investigating these serious issues that were so you don't agree with the
president was not happy that he appointed a Mr. Horowitz you have
confidence in Michael Horowitz as the Inspector General well look I welcome
anybody to come help investigate because so far it's only the House
Intelligence Committee Republicans who are actually doing anything to get to
the bottom of who was colluding with Russia and when we fill this back we we
have clear evidence of collusion but it's not between the Trump campaign it's
between the Democratic Party and the Hillary campaign and the Russian boom
just like we told you years ago it was all completely clear and that's why they
blamed Trump for it because they were so scared of it that that's a good tactic
actually so just briefly before I go to this Ted News you can come back with
more on the other side and then show you the type of videos are trying to ban off
YouTube they want to ban us but they want to misrepresent what we said but
that doesn't work because we have the clips so then they just continue to
engage in disinformation we are running the biggest specials in my 23 years
history on air we've never done 80% off but we have like 3,000 items 3,000
different products we sell them for work store.com and a lot of there's so many we
don't even really promote them so when I say we got 80% off on apparel that stuff
that didn't sell but doesn't mean it's not some of my favorite stuff or great
products it just hasn't been paid attention to so check that out those
are lost leaders in a big way super male vitality 50% off pollen block works so

all there again the adult toothpaste is Florida free sold out we still have the
children's and we've got more of a lot of the products at this sale level have
sold out so again throughout the week we're going to extend the operation save
the second amendment save the first amendment save the internet Paul Revere
special but we've got to end a lot of these the next few days because they're
going to sell out and it's months before more comes in so thank you for
standing in the face the globalist everything you do is turning with tide
infowarstore.com but spread articles spread videos pray for us thank those
local affiliates send them a donation every month sign up to tide on your
calendar but know this we're defending a religious freedom we're
defending Christianity we're not taking each or off our calendar like Apple
we're not supporting Apple being taken over the about the Communist Chinese
we're fighting hard infowarstore.com if you want to support us you will
continue this operation against Hillary Clinton's lawsuits two of her lawyers
against us you name it we're going to win those we got to fight them so again
please stand with us here is Nugent on gun control and Trump is basically
suffering the globalist well the most important thing that you and I have to
focus on is our side the truth will metastasize the truth will spread the
more we can get our side conservatives people in the asset column people who
work for a living people who believe in the self-evident truth in our founding
documents they are with us but the dumbing down of America didn't just hit
leftists it's hit conservatives as well and there's a lot of knee-jerk over
reaction going on and the minute Donald Trump even invites someone from the
other side a lot of our friends will go why is he even dealing with those people
he's never talked to those people well that's not how you get things done and I
know how he operates there's a term and I'll give it to you and you can beep at
whatever you want but what drives the American dream and quality of life are
kickers people who bust their ass to be in the asset column make sacrifices and
take risks entrepreneurs welders and carpenters and hard-working ranchers and
farmers and guitar players and people that know they have to be productive but
makes America great every day always has always will but a lot of our side will
get angry the minute you even give a nod to the other side and you have to give a
nod to the other side so it encourages them to speak up to expose their
dishonesty and their horrible agenda president Trump is the ultimate kicker
he is a strategist you can't build an empire like that if you don't meet with
all concerns and get them comfortable and get them to believe that you are
listening to their points of view no matter how absurd it is so it knocks down
their guard now I'm not gonna get any more detail than that but all I can tell
you is that when Donald Trump meets with maniacs like Diane Feinstein who will
not let her constituents carry a gun while she has a 38 in her purse a king
a tyrant does that that's why we wrote down after we shot the British at Concord
Bridge that we can say what we want to say we can choose our religion we're
gonna have a media that was supposed to monitor the government we have the right
to keep and bear arms not just the king the people we the people have the right
to keep and bear arms if you try to take away from us we'll shoot you we're not
slaves we're not slaves we're not subject we're free citizens it was a
good brand-new hallelujah experiment self-government so so when Trump meets
with the other side it is the perfect strategy keep your eyes open keep your
ears open watch what he does I think that his America great and remember and
every one of his speeches every one of his campaign stops he mentioned the
Second Amendment when was the last guy running for office that did that that
often never before I believe now anything can happen I'm incapable of
being shocked by anything anymore but I pay attention and I trust President
Trump this guy is a clever strategist president Donald Trump will go down in
history as the best president this country has ever had to support him and
here's the bottom line you want you and I've talked about forever it isn't the
left of the enemy it's our own guys who have their head up their ass and our
rendered helpless and worthless by self-inflicted apathy if you're not
calling your elected employees every week and demanding the Trump agenda
demanding to crush these anti-gun bills if you're not doing that don't expect
your elected employees to cover you yours he is the living Rowdy Rowdy Piper
they live he is the real deal more coming up with Ted Nugent straight ahead

you're listening to the alex jones show
well we just played a very powerful clip with Ted Nugent and again I've met
some of the other biggest rock stars out there most of them are leftist or
their brain dad or their drug addicts or their cowards they might have some
decent music but they're long gone but people like Dave Mustaine he's a
conservative he's a patriot and they try to take away Dave's ability to tour
and you notice you don't hear Dave being political anymore and I'm not
not kidding he was had a lot of courage came on the show did a lot of stuff he
cost him tens of millions he stayed at my house many times good friend I don't
blame it came out for his family you name it not Ted Nugent if people don't
know there's no money now in recording or online it's all in concerts and Ted
Nugent has a built-in audience I didn't just believe him I've read it before and
I looked it up last night driving home from Waco where he lives outside Ted
Nugent has one of the best sell-out rates he's like an 87% sell-out rate
small towns big cities and since he did this we're gonna play the clip tomorrow
we haven't got it yet we have like nine hours of footage all three cameras three
hours you know total each camera Ted Nugent has been massively and it's not
about the money he's happy it's that they do it to little people too we're
talking tens of millions of dollars per tour he could have had he could have had
three plus tours in like 12 5 12 to 15 million dollars a piece grows for his
band everybody else killing the economy this is the bullying this is the
controls why Hollywood rolls over it's why everybody's a leftist it's the cult
it's the anti free market that's coming tomorrow when you host the show the
the weekday program 11 a.m. the 3 p.m. but Nugent on Americana why he woke up
why he's one of the first people during the 60s to go public against it we've
got another clip here it is
hysteria and the dishonesty about firearms is staggering and if you want
to save children's lives which all conscientious caring people want to do
you don't go after lies you go after reality and science and ballistic
knowledge none of them seem to have that
that's his new album that's how he plays Cranglehold and the Star Spangled Banner
that's all coming this week
oh yeah he played his whole concert is living around unbelievable his spirit
is not arrogant or narcissistic or power-grabbing it's just human male and
strong and his wife spirit is just as strong they're one of the strongest
pairs I've ever seen triple Magnum
huge long-suggestions that's like this on a regular mind that's awesome it's so
cool I can't stand it Ted you talk about how your websites your tours are more
proper than ever but they are trying to boycott you they're trying to block you
you didn't want to get into it earlier because you want to see if you can fix it
but everybody's under unprecedented attempt to bully us out of the market of
ideas yeah any of the success of your health your stamina I mean it really is
an American but at the same time you've worked hard for it you've got your great
coffee you've got your best-selling ammo rock star and a father and all the
things you've done you've also launched a lot of great products and things that's
what this country is all about that's what really I'm gonna love it this is
going on Facebook every day I salute entrepreneurs across this country that
I'm not mad at the crew but I told them cut me out God Almighty I love Wilson
he's a sweetheart but Lord I mean just cut me out of my hair stickers ramp because
I don't want to be in this video I want to have Ted Nugent man God here let's go
back to it fight and take risks to start business and employ people and be in the
asset column and the Nugent family has always stood by that we've always worked
and earned our own way and when you stand up for the Second Amendment all
of a sudden you have ammo with your name on it and I have gold-tipped arrows with
my signature and I have my new Java but bottom line is working hard playing hard
America is alive and well and I'm just proud to be one of them she may not get
up early every day we work really hard every day and then we snuggle at night
and get ready to start over tomorrow so I'm just here to salute people who who
really earn that's the position in the evil woman we're card play our audience
is at the concert yes it has a life that's only a firestorm of ferocity my
music and my band and my audience's love real American soul music and rock and
roll music and rhythm and blues and this is best in 2018 and this is the best
year of my life in spite of the crazy world around us and I think to some
degree because of the crazy world around us you see dishonesty and ignorance
and hate and rotten evil and nastiness from the left and it makes you really
confident that you're doing good there's a there's a colloquialism of
battle cry that I always end up with sometimes you give the world the best
you got and you get kicked in the teeth give the world the best you got anyway
all right and you guys we got three hours of just it's all bombshell and then
Ted's like I want you on the spur of the wild skin there it's gonna be some fun
stuff he divided me like ten years ago and five years ago I'm glad I went and
did it so so that was that was Harrison doing a great job but put me in it so he
did a bad job that's that he went from a plus to him to a to a c-minus but let's
go to Ted Nugent who illustrates one shotgun shell double-ock buck is nine
nine millimeter rounds and then you go to Magnum and stuff but actually longer
longer it's even more so again imagine if you were using a sawed-off shotgun this
is a duck gun that's really long we don't have the clip I was just told we had
the clip why in the Hades and I'm not mad about this but like the
communication like we have this clip that Wilson has that we're gonna play
and we're gonna give it to you and then it doesn't happen but hey that's the
fun part about live radio is that it's real and we're a small crew up here on
Sunday night so no teleprompters in this studio will be lucky this interview
everything gets out like the bigger it is the longer it is the better it is I
don't know what goes on everybody's like too busy on their own Twitter and
Facebook like talking to ten people and everything I'm not mad about that it's
just like well just at least come in my ear and tell me why I was told we had
this but we don't have it just just just there was a confusion there was a
confusion well hey hey I'm all glad about that I love that I love that I love
this I love this but you got to double-check every clip when you're
hosting this week you got to make sure it's in the computer and you got to make
sure it plays because it's one thing to go get the interview it's nothing to
care it that's what it comes down to and like I said I don't want any interviews
air that have more than 10 seconds to be in five minutes I might not you know what
I may not air the news interview I may edit it myself I may wait and come back
in a week and do it because I can edit the way I want because hell would freeze
over I could have a billion dollars and say do not put me in this and you would
do it that's okay fun fun it's fun it's fun it's fun it's fun I love it I love it
you love that nobody listens to me trying to get a new desk in here I just
love it I freaking you know I just love it anyways how are you in the bed well
