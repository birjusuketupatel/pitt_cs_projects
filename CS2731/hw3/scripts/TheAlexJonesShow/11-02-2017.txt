from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
all right ladies and gentlemen what we have here is trucks going rogue I mean
these trucks these trucks are out of control I don't know if you heard jake
tapper but he was breaking it down the weight of the truck the front axle the
rear axle how you can rent these trucks how people are now thinking about making
it tougher to rent these trucks I'm just waiting for these anti-gun lobbies to
be outside of Home Depot I'm sure they're planning it to be outside of
Home Depot chanting no more trucks so I'm just waiting for that because
obviously folks what we have here is we've got rogue trucks in fact we've got
30 plus rogue trucks in the last couple years and it doesn't matter who's
driving the truck what kind of racist are you to even ask that question and I'm
starting to think that these these trucks are actually the one shouting
a la who lock bar I don't even think it's the people inside so we've got rogue
trucks folks they're running out of control I heard it on CNN and a la who
lock bar is actually a beautiful thing okay and the trucks are the ones that
are the problem here not the a la who lock bar radical Islamic terrorists no
no of course this is what you would think if you listened to Jake Fopper
excuse me fake tapper my bad Jake tapper Wow welcome into the Alex Jones show
folks it's amazing here we are so much news and the news is so big and the
news is so frequent that the biggest news every day becomes a back page story
the next day the Las Vegas massacre cover-up nothing the JFK files being
declassified Hitler still alive all the history textbooks we lie lied to us I
was lied to my entire life about JFK knowingly by my government I was lied
to my entire life about Hitler knowingly by my government and that's just a
non-story now because you've got another radical truck running people down in
the streets folks I'm Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones today but do not
be afraid because we have a ton of great guests today we will be hearing from
Alex Jones in the next segment and then David Knight will be joining me in
studio Paul Joseph Watson will be Skyping in from Europe where the trucks
are out of control in Europe folks we got to do something about these trucks
before they make it here Leigh Ann McAdoo will be in studio with me at one
Roger Stone joins me at 130 and then from NoMoreFakeNews.com John Rappaport
takes over in the fourth hour there is a little bit of intrigue actually right
now surrounding this terrorist attack in New York no it wasn't a truck that's
guilty it was another radical Islamic terrorist now the wife is saying she's
shocked neighbors are saying the family was acting very mysterious so you
wonder what she actually knew how much they knew at the mosque then you've
get the you got this story I totally get what he did Moscow or who knew tear
truck driver rails against President Bush's Middle East policy and this is
actually the funny thing this is where the radical Islamic terrorist and the
radical left actually see eye-to-eye but the funny thing is the people that
don't like President Bush's Middle East policy I'm one of them the people on
the left though don't have the common sense don't have the logic to realize
hey there's people in those countries that don't like President Bush's
Middle East policy either that might want to come here and kill me well you
just experienced another one of them in New York so will the political left
wake up to the fact that yes our Middle East policy pisses these people off and
makes them want to come here and murder us and it's not virtue to want to bring
them here and die okay that's ignorant that's stupid that's a moron that's an
idiot you can go on and then I mean it's honestly it's really the the religion
of Islam is really so peaceful that now in Egypt they're saying it's okay to
just rape girls it's a national duty in fact that's on info wars calm don't go

my fellow info warriors my fellow humans that want basic freedom and liberty
and don't want psychopaths ruling our planet we are entering the core of the
fight now as we pointed out the pedophile scandals were set to break in
the last year in Hollywood that dam is breaking Trump is delivering turning
good law enforcement loose on these rings the pedophile rings form the
governance system of these networks and are the heart of their blackmail
operation just like regular gangs go out and rob liquor stores to prove that
they're part of the gang and are now initiated into a crime so they can be
compromised the same way with the pedophile networks that form the heart
of the EU the UK and the US Canadian Australian control grid that cult of
controls under direct assault now the NFL and every other globalist
organization has lined up against America and lined up against President
Trump in an attempt to bully us back into submission but as I've pointed out
the revolutionary systems of mental illness that they created the psychological
warfare vats that are the colleges and mainstream media in Hollywood if they
could be contained would begin to eat each other would begin to turn on each
other and I've seen the signs the last three months of the power structure
turning against the Clintons this is absolutely critical and we've gone over
all those developments but the biggest one yet is on drudgereport.com right now
from Politico it's also on news wars dot com inside Hillary Clinton's secret
takeover of the DNC again they call us fake news constantly because we're
absolutely on target and research their actual activities but all of you watch
it as well and many of you have more pieces of the puzzle than I do but they
stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders in scores of states that he won
from New Hampshire to California and we even got national electors to admit on
camera they didn't matter if he won a bunch of states early on that they would
just be given to Hillary and indeed he would win states by 10 15 20 points she
would be given more delegates than he was so now Brazil coming out and saying
that Hillary Clinton rigged the nomination process took over the
Democratic Party and stole the election when these two women act like their best
friends they're all a bunch of psychopathic sociopathic banshees the
literal harpy demons the fact that they're turning on each other publicly
shows they realize the Clintons are continuing to destroy their party at the
accelerated rate remember it's Brazil that went on TV and said CNN didn't give
the debate questions to Hillary and lied for when Brazil had been involved
carrying it out so again Podesta's in trouble his brother's in trouble she's
in trouble they're all in trouble and who are they attacking they're attacking
info wars because they know we've got their number well this is the fight I
was looking for but the fact that they're now turning on each other just
like drudge ran our headline last week about Democratic elite turns on the
Clintons you're now seeing that manifest big time and so you add this into the
EU falling apart and Briggs it and the Austrian elections going for
nationalism and patriotism and Catalan and what they're doing and what we just
saw yeah in places like Italy with two referendums saying no to the EU
expansion and the Czech Republic vote for a patriot I mean this is happening
and you hear what these people are saying that are becoming presidents and
prime ministers it's like it's the Alex Jones show now again let me explain
something what's critical I don't say that to brag I say it so we could
understand how effective all of you have been and the fact that we're not
being infiltrated by foreign governments our ideas of Americana coming back
that everybody always wanted to be part of it everybody wanted to come here and
be part of I didn't invent this I'm just helping with you rebooted with all the
other great patriots that have helped break through the globalist wall like
Donald Trump and Matt Drudge and and Sean Hannity and Steven Bannon and the
Info Wars crew and world net daily and everybody else this has been an
incredible time standing up to their bullying the fights only getting more
intense right now but we have turned the tide the enemy could still reverse it
but this is a celebration I mean state-run Russian TV is running large
clips of my show about the New World Order and the globalist and the banksters
every week that isn't Russia infiltrating us that's Americana baby the
same one that helped bring down the Soviet Union I mean just a shadow of
Americana helped bring on the Levi's and Coca-Cola that's not America America's
free market and religious freedom and being honorable being rugged
individuals with they're not infiltrating us America is coming back
worldwide ladies and gentlemen and when you sell Americana versus globalism we
win every time this is a sales job and we're selling liberty versus tyranny
so again ultra massive story how they rigged it confirming everything we ever
said but again they did it in plain view now continuing they've had Newsweek
salon all the usual Soros mouthpieces come out and say that I lied and said
that there was a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for Trump's overthrow
beginning November 4th now ladies and gentlemen we've checked online on the
New York Times site they did run the full-page ad again this is about them
thinking they control reality so that our forces don't get ready and aren't
peacefully watching what happens and so we're asleep on Saturday when they try
to launch this thing they'll go for the next few months of their own words with
top Republicans telling Roger Stone they intend to remove Trump by December so
again it's a military tactic to announce to their forces they're gonna move with
violence and destabilization but to tell us it's not happening it's all a
mind game but we've got photos and scans of it up on m4wars.com and it real
Alex Jones on Twitter and that dovetails with a daily drumbeat on CNN
MSNBC you name it and now on m4wars.com we have an article Snoop Dogg make
America Crip again with an image of Trump dead laying on a stretcher with a
co-tag with a death stamp on it I mean this is just another nobody thug want
to be tough guy that helps sell the gangster culture to black folks the
last 25 years to help put tens of millions of people in prison total CIA
operation right out of LA with the with the crack cocaine being shipped in it's
it's all an absolute fact Snoop Dogg's a prison guard to make young black people
think this is cool to lock them up Snoop Dogg will be wearing a giant KKK white
hat and I'm serious it's come out the LBJ plan to ship drugs into the black
communities get them on welfare and destroy them and then have all this
gangster culture sold by the 80s and 90s to totally destroy black people and now
that's been a beta test they're doing it everybody else using the weaponized
fake gangster black culture what a piece of garbage but that feeds into all
this kill Trump constant garbage and trying to push a race war and Clarence
Thomas coming out and saying he doesn't even recognize America with the
incredible division that's how globalist bring a country down ladies and
gentlemen but the good news is Trump is getting ready to move with anti trust
against Google and others for their censorship and Facebook and Twitter
they've been doing it in triplicate I'm not defending AT&T and Time Warner I
can't stand Time Warner they're globalist but the Justice Department not
even Trump controlling it has been going after and is now talking about an
anti-trust suit or a breakup of those companies are not letting emerge when
they have not one half the power of Google alone I mean Google has 90% of
internet activity and here in the US and ladies and gentlemen they already are
dominating and controlling and trying to consolidate so Google is the big one
Facebook and Twitter they're anti-american globalist organizations that
have to be brought to the line and have to stop their draconian activities now

sitting in for Alex right now we're gonna be stacked up with guests for the
rest of the show you're not going to want to miss it you know sometimes
there's stories that you cover that you just don't even believe and this would
be one of them posted on info wars dot com sources louder with Crowder rape
culture Egyptian lawyer says raping girls is a national duty yes really and
just trying to recall exactly I'm pretty sure that the new Egyptian regime was
actually a regime that the United States government under Obama was influencing
the change of regimes there no problem with that though no American influence
in that that's perfectly fine only the Russians are bad but funny I don't see
stories coming out of Russia with Russian lawyers saying raping girls is a
national duty and unfortunately under the new Egyptian regime they're getting
more radical Islamic than they have been in the past but this is a clip now this
clip is actually spoken in English I'm gonna have to read the subtitles and
translate it for you but yes this really happened Egyptian lawyer says raping
girls is a national duty are you happy when you see a girl walking down the
street with half of her behind showing do you think that we can care about our
girls I say that when a girl walks about like that it is a patriotic duty to
sexually harass her and a national duty to rape her it is a national duty to
rape such a girl what she allows herself to do constitutes depravity there
you go
hmm the political left claims that they stick up for women's rights Linda
sarsour claims that she is all about women's freedom women's rights women's
empowerment so I guess it's empowering in Egypt if you're a female to walk
around whether you consider it scantily clad or not if you're showing skin they
consider that scantily clad and there you just heard it you will get raped
because that's what you deserve
huh do you see why we can't just have open borders here folks okay do you see
why we can't have a mandated diversity program started by the Democrats
praised by Chuck Schumer and now Donald Trump is going to end it do you see why
not only do we deal with people that hate us because of the Bush regime starting
a war a non-stop never ending war in the Middle East but also their culture does
not fit with our culture think about what do you think is going to happen if a
bunch of Muslim men radical Muslim men Orthodox Islam come here are walking
down the street and then they see your young daughter and her friends wearing
short skirts and halter tops and what have you well in their culture it's a
national duty to rape them and now you see why Sweden is the rape capital of
the world it's honestly maddening it's honestly maddening because look at this
in fact let's go to this right now there is an all-out assault on men right now
folks okay and not the is Islamic kind in fact if you're a radical Islamic man
you're probably fine but if you're a white male specifically you're probably
the bad guy and that's what I really think all this Harvey Weinstein thing is
about to not just deflect off the pedophilia that's going on there but
also to attack men masculinity because you can't have a masculine man and then
bully everybody if you try to bully a group of people and there's one masculine
man there you're not going to get away with it the bully will be shut down but
here's Michelle Obama nothing on Egypt but says men are entitled and self-righteous
because women protect them too much here's Michael excuse me Michelle Obama
and we want to in the world today is we we we love our boys and we raise our
girls you know we raise them to be you talking about we take care not to hurt
men and and I think we pay for that a little bit and that's a wee thing because
we're raising them you know and it's powerful to have strong men but what
does that strength mean you know does it mean respect does it mean responsibility
does it mean compassion or are we protecting our men too much so they
feel a little entitled and a little you know you know a little self-righteous
sometimes but that's kind of on us too as as as women and others yeah you know
as we nurture men and push girls to be perfect hmm okay that didn't even make
sense so there's a Michael Obama Michael Obama sitting there in a lumberjack
shirt this doesn't make sense see that's what I'm telling you they don't even the
the agenda here is to constantly attack men constantly berate men and demonize
what they're gonna consider toxic masculinity which is just any man who's
not willing to get bullied any man who's willing to stand for a cause any man
that's willing to stand for anything really you can't stand for something
you're gonna fall for anything so they don't want you to stand for anything so
you will fall for anything like I don't know Trump Russia collusion a lone
shooter in the JFK assassination lone shooter in the Vegas massacre a bunch
of bull see they can't lie to you and beat you down into the ground under
their under their thumb if you're masculine no they have to berate men
and tear men down but what does she even talk about the reason why it makes no
sense is because she's on the agenda to attack men beat men down constantly any
angle you can find any chance you get so she's up here bumbling and fumbling
around like some sort of jack wagon because she's not meant to make sense
it's just meant to attack men that is the goal so it doesn't matter it doesn't
matter that these people Michelle Obama's ilk want to bring in people from
radical Islamic countries and if you don't like that then you're a racist
even though Islam isn't a race yeah there's the there's the lumberjack
Michael Obama just got done shopping wood if you know what I'm saying and
she'll say nothing though about the rape culture that has followed
multiculturalism in Sweden she'll say nothing about the rape culture in the
Islamic State of Egypt now where a lawyer says that a raping a girl is a
national duty I mean this is sick I'm not trying to be you know again insensitive
here but I'm sorry but Michelle have you seen the way your daughter behaves and
dresses what do you think would happen to her in an Islamic country what do you
think would happen to your daughters if they are really your daughters what do
you think would happen to them if they were walking around Egypt where they
now say if you can see their skin or they're wearing tight pants that they
should be raped and that's national duty show Obama's not hearing that men are
the problem we need to beat our men down we can't let them grow up to be
masculine how dare a man be masculine hey Daniel Brieman why new mana

Alex Jones show
you're listening to the antidote for fake news it's Alex Jones you know there's a
couple guys here at the office that drive trucks and I'm starting to become
very afraid I am and I think that they need to turn their truck in for something
that won't run me over in the streets like we're seeing in Europe and in the
United States don't you dare blame radical Islam for this okay because Jake
Tapper will be all over you but in the break David and I were talking about
how there is a plan to stop the free travel of the US citizen essentially
bring in automated cars use all the times of different excuses to say that
you're a liability behind the wheel of a car and now we're starting to hear
stories of individuals being blocked from some of these ride services right
because of their politics yes it's not just Twitter it's not just Twitter and
YouTube and Facebook where they're shutting people down understand that
right now we're talking about them censoring free speech and of course
there's been interesting revelation coming out in the last couple of days as
Twitter officials were talking about the Russian hacking of the election they
admitted oh you know we were shutting down 50% of the tweets about Hillary
we're shutting down 25% of the tweets about Podesta's emails and blocking
people that were tweeting about it too that's right that's right so you know
we know that there's political censorship going on and as I've been
talking about the effort to take away our ability to own cars to drive them
ourselves because they want to be in control of everything in our lives and
that's a very important issue because once they take away private ownership
once they turn us over to their corporate cronies who will own the cars
and they will charge us by the mile by the minute they'll attack and attack
and track everything that we do yeah I think it's interesting we see Laura
Loomer now has been banned by Uber and Lyft because of something she put on
Twitter so it's come full circle they use Twitter to they draw you into these
platforms of Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and then they suppress any
speech that they don't like and then if you criticize Uber and Lyft and of
course you know whether or not you agree with what Lauren Loomer said she said
that somebody needs to create a non-Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because
I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver so what they did was
they shut her off of both Uber and Lyft understand that when the government gets
control of your mobility and I've said this from the very beginning it'll be
either the government or it'll be their crony corporate partners that they work
with because they're working together to push this down your throat whether you
like it or not many people say hey I'm never gonna have a car that drives
itself I'm never gonna buy into that you're gonna have a trendy it's trendy
that's right yeah all this stuff about hey you like your car you can keep your
car you like your truck you can keep it there's pushing all this that's
familiar and you know they're pushing the idea that they're gonna ban cars and
trucks in cities it'll be done for a variety of reasons right now they're
doing it across Europe because they say we got to protect you from the pollution
but it's also going to be a security measure and then once they do that if
they don't like you you won't be able to get a job they will shadow ban you just
like they shadow ban the hashtags understand you may not even know that
you've been banned you may say hey you know I called for this taxi to come pick
me up and I still haven't gotten it I don't know really what's going on and
then oh and when we look at this I don't know if you saw this report that came
out there's a married couple that said we think that Facebook is listening to us
so they did a little bit of a a test they don't have a cat they never talked
about cats and so they put a thing out where for a day or two they're talking
for an entire day they talk about cat the cat is almost out of food we should
buy some cat food so forth and so on they said the next day they started
getting served ads for cat food and so they said we're being listened to by
Facebook and of course Facebook comes out and said absolutely no way and it's
not the first time somebody has done that no I have actually ran an exact same
experiment with my friend where we were we were both in the car and driving I
don't have Facebook anymore but he had Facebook on his phone and we were both
talking about an old this was probably a couple years ago we were both talking
about an old high school friend of ours yeah and we hadn't talked to this
individual in years and all of a sudden he pops up we finished the car ride he
pops up as a friend possible friend on Facebook it just happens to pop up right
there after so we saw that and we were like no way so we kind of did something
like these people did yeah and again we started talking about another person
boom that person popped up under the friend request so I don't know what kind
of algorithms I mean I haven't read the I don't have Facebook but if you read the
privacy policy probably says in there you know we're gonna have access to your
other apps they say they're not doing it but the question is oh they're doing it
believe your lying eyes or this corporation that has a vested interest in
this and of course you can do your own experiment just as Owen did or just as
these people you be shocked yourself yeah that's absolutely amazing and of
course here's another thing it's Google to Google does it too yeah you talk about
how the how it's you know years ago Eric Schmidt said that at Google we're
gonna get right up to the line of creepy well they've gone way beyond that many
many times and when you look at what's happening get another good example
another big corporation Apple their new phone the iPhone X they came out of
course it has facial recognition they said well we're not going to have that
data transmitted back to Apple so all the privacy experts say oh good for you
you're gonna keep that private you're gonna keep it on the phone well you know
as William Benny has told us many times nothing on your phone is safe nothing
on your phone is private and now they are admitting it's come out that any app
developers have access to this even though it's stored on your phone and
it's not on the cloud an app developer can still use this and can still get all
this information so what difference does that make because of course it's gonna
be buried in the service agreements right Owen they're gonna say well we can
have access to your biometrics it's a misnomer for Facebook to say oh we don't
listen to your conversations it's a misnomer for Apple to say oh we don't
share your facial recognition technology with anyone but what they do is they
already have these deals and you can actually see this in the privacy the
terms of use that you sign they specifically say that these apps these
other apps will be allowed access to the data that is acquired via Facebook or
the facial recognition so okay oh yeah technically Facebook isn't eavesdropping
Facebook isn't listening it's the Google app that's listening and then
Facebook takes that data puts it into their algorithms and then produces that
content for you so it's kind of just like a past the buck situation where
there's only one or two apps it's on everyone phone that's listening and then
all the other apps have access to that data and you give them that access when
you agree to the terms of use it's a shell game it's semantics they say well
we're not listening as your point that's why I mentioned the thing about iPhone
iPhone says well we're not we're not gonna have anything to do with your
facial recognition data we're not gonna have anything about your biometric data
we're not gonna store that but oh by the way all of our apps will have access to
it and they can do whatever they want now we're trusting that these apps will
ask for your permission and of course you've read all of the all of the
detailed legal agreements and licensing agreements on all the apps that you've
got on your phone right well actually there's a few that I do read because what
they do now is they have to tell you access to this this and this and of
course I still download the app but you read it and you're just like I mean
it honestly yeah you feel guilty when you say okay I'll download this app even
though you just said you're literally gonna take all the data off of my phone
and you know this whole iPhone X thing to me David has been very strange because
Apple still is having a hard time selling the iPhone 8 they've been
behind sales on the iPhone 8 since they launched that and then they come out
with the iPhone X to me prematurely when they still have a stock of iPhone 8's
they don't get the immediate rush they thought they cut their production in
half then they sell that and they say oh look at demand for the iPhone X it's
huge it's huge that was a whole rigged game too because they actually had to
cut back their production so but I'm wondering David I have I'll say I have a
conspiracy theory that Apple released the iPhone X early because they see the
backlash and the awareness now that people have with the control of social
media and the access to all of your personal information and so they wanted
to inject the iPhone X out into the public as soon as possible with the
facial recognition technology even though the iPhone 8 is still not selling
because they had to get that out there to the other developers they had to get
that facial recognition technology out there for everyone to have it before
people hit the full panic mode like no stay out of my life I know you're
you're breaking my constitutional rights yeah you know quite frankly I'm not
gonna get involved in something that's going to collect my biometric data and
get the iPhone 10 huh no you know interestingly enough you know I was an
engineer because I love technology right I always looked at it as a force for
good I don't anymore I don't because I see what these corporations are doing
with it I see who controls this technology and so even though I was there
on day one for the first several iPhone releases I'm not interested anymore
quite frankly it's kind of become boring technology Steve Wozniak when the
co-founders of Apple said now he's not interested in getting another one he's
it's just become a maintenance cash cow for these guys and then of course it
spies on you and takes your facial recognition that's the big issue that's
the big issue we'll be right back with more of the Ox Jones show now ladies and

the amount of lying that goes on on some television news networks and in our
government is honestly disgusting for example they are trying to paint a
picture that Facebook ads were purchased to influence the election towards
Donald Trump however strangely enough Facebook admits that the Russian ads were
actually against Donald Trump. Ads pro Clinton anti Clinton or could you tell
or these activities viewed in the aggregate the activity again really
appears to address a wide range of hot button topics and appears directed at
at at fomenting the Facebook representative aiming discourse in
terms of volume again what how much volume are we talking about Lindsey
Graham about approximately 90% of the volume we saw on the ad side appears to
be issues-based primarily a much smaller proportion were directed at particular
candidates but in terms of the actual Facebook assets I think some I said one
in 23,000 I don't know maybe that was another company correct so in terms of
the total volume of material on the side it's a very small percentage we
estimate that the internet research agency content it was approximately 0.004
percent of the content in newsfeed I'm sure that really influenced the election
so to sum this up and I'll come back with a jihadist around to Russia as a
nation-state started interfering in the election cycle back in 2015 just saying
that is and they continued after the election during the election they were
trying to create discord between Americans most of it directed against
Clinton after the Democrats dividing America Russia tied groups and
organizations trying to undermine President Trump's legitimacy is that
what you saw on Facebook say that's an accurate statement doesn't accurate
statement I'm not sure I can characterize of on our network which way the
it's a man from Google thank you what okay that was just great
sorry I didn't think wow so basically there you have it even though Lindsey
Graham was trying to insert that idea that Russia's dividing Russia's buying
the ad then the Facebook I admits like actually it was all anti-Trump stuff
90% of it was anti-Trump stuff but they're not gonna say that on CNN or
MSNBC tonight they're gonna continue to force upon us this false narrative that
Russia was the one that influenced our election it was all Russia David you
don't even exist did you know that I thought it was interesting you didn't
vote that's right you never covered a Trump rally you don't exist well you
know it's interesting what he said was well it was 0.004 percent in other
words for 1,000th of a percent that's cutting it pretty small isn't it and it's
coming from these are ads that they purchased and of course they've now
revealed that there was a Russian troll farm that was operating a page that was
organizing anti-Trump rallies in New York so yeah it was anti-Trump but I
think this is interesting oh and when we look at this he's talking about ads
that were purchased and they're saying you know hundred thousand ads or whatever
but what we find from these hearings also is that Twitter is reporting that
they shut down automatically shut down 48% of the tweets that use the hashtag
DNC leak now this is in the last couple of weeks of the election and they shut
down 25% of the tweets that used hashtag pedestrian emails this is what the
Twitter general counsel Sean edget said in written testimony to the Senate
Judiciary Committee on Tuesday so think about this this is something that is
coming from 57,000 users posted 426,000 unique tweets containing hashtag
pedestrian emails so it's very widespread this is not a few Russian
troll farms that are buying ads with them this is the grassroots protests what
people are really talking about on Twitter you got 57,000 users putting up
427,000 tweets about pedestrian emails and they are algorithmically censoring
this that's what he's talking about and then half of the tweets that are
talking about the DNC leaks so this is a systemic censorship that is coming from
these individuals I don't think people understand the seriousness of this
David because not only are they censoring people's speech on these
platforms this is a it's a really like a triple-edged sword if that's even a
thing because a this is where everyone goes everyone's on Twitter and Facebook
then they're there they did a factor monopoly exactly there's no competition
because oh wait what happened when competition sprung sprung up in the name
of gab they erased gab and they banned gab from all app stores so you can't get
gab on your iPhone you can't get gab on your your Android so you're forced to get
Twitter or Facebook where they admit they are censoring news politically based
on what you're saying politically so there is about what's going on with the
the Baker speech situation okay free speech or whether it is freedom of
religion this is the Supreme Court case this is about the Baker who refused to
bake a cake for a gay wedding and he said that's that violates my freedom of
religion and this is reported by USA Today they said this is the most highly
contested inflammatory case there's only been in the last several years there's
only been three topics that even come close to this kind of controversy
that's abortion affirmative action and Obamacare and they've had so many briefs
on both sides of this just in the last two months they've had a hundred legal
briefs about this because this is saying no you cannot refuse service to these
people and of course he's saying well I'm not just baking them a cake I'm
participating in their ceremony and that's the problem that I have with it
but Twitter and Facebook and Google are just providing a service but they are
interjecting themselves into the free speech issue even though they have a
de facto monopoly that's the issue right there and if I just don't see how
they're going to be able to continue to operate in a censorship way maybe with
the Trump administration we'll see that shut down there's a regulated as a
monopoly because it truly is but these bakeries are not monopolies they can go
down the street to somebody else but they truly do have a monopoly but they
it shows how they are have different standards just as you point about about
gab they have different standards for different people if you are a friend of
theirs if you're part of the insider establishment then you can do whatever you
want there's no more rules that apply to them than there are rules that apply to
Hillary Clinton or to Robert Mueller they can do whatever they want they can
set up crooked deals with the Russian companies and then they can hide that they
can obstruct justice they can put gag orders on people as Robert Mueller does
and then he gets appointed as the investigator of Russian collusion I
just probably using his office to destroy evidence it'll be interesting to see
what may what what comes of that obviously this this the swamp rat looking
for the swamp rat but here was a story that just came from CNBC today
Department of Justice reportedly considers antitrust suit to block AT&T's
$85 billion acquisition of Time Warner I'm wondering Trump just brought in that
antitrust lawyer into his administration I'm just wondering if they really are
looking at Facebook and Twitter and where their funds are going and how
politically charged these individuals really are because that to me is the
real antitrust you need to look at when you can't even bring anything into the
market as this is a long-time tactic look when I was working with a libertarian
party we would go through all these hurdles that the Democrats or Republicans
never had to do to get on the ballot they're so great we're gonna be in the
debates no the debates are being run by a private organization usually it was
some kind of association of the press and they can include or exclude whoever
they wish this is a very very old tactic of political control that the
establishment has used for a long time they're taking that same principle and
they're using it now with Google Facebook Twitter all these different
platforms saying that well this is private so they can do whatever they
want they can shut down your free speech and when you think about that we
think about the fact that they would take this away from a debate platform
that's being run by the government intentionally turn it over to a private
organization so they could shut this down and you understand how involved they
were not only shutting down get a gab but also in terms of creating these
platforms you understand what their true purpose is well we had the project
Veritas video release come out that had the guy from YouTube and Google
admitting yeah we censor Alex Jones we don't want Alex Jones to show up we
can't have people looking at that they hate us that much and they hate free
speech that much and it's frustrating for me I keep getting sent honestly David
I I don't have Facebook haven't had for years I don't want Facebook I don't
need them I'm so sick of Twitter now because I can't even send out a tweet
without it getting censored I had my impressions and I still had no response
from Twitter on this I've noticed that other conservatives are now experiencing
the same thing my Twitter impressions literally got cut in half oh yeah I don't
know if you notice that too admitting it now because the DNC and because of
Podesta emails they're admitting that they cut them in half our quarter
depending on the topic they say well well we'll take half of those out or
we'll take a quarter of those out you don't know you don't even know that
you're being censored no no they just delete it it's just like it's gone and
then yesterday guys pull this up on the war on the war room Twitter I tweet out
a poll literally nothing insensitive total milk toast poll not no race no
religion nothing and Twitter says it's sensitive content David sensitive
content that's right they're very sensitive to everything and they're
watching everything you do oh but you know if you want to tweet about you know
killing Donald Trump or shutting down info wars or killing Trump supporters
then you're a ok there it is there's the poll it's sensitive vitamin mineral

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
good news is that the deep state shadow government corrupt establishment is so
desperate right now that they're all showing their true colors and the
middle-of-the-road Americans that aren't necessarily politically involved
politically active watching the news paying attention to everything are
seeing them now because they're showing their true colors as absolute anti-
American hypocrites here's a video compilation of the political left
showing its true colors as hypocrites
Jim I mean this story started breaking at the end of my show yesterday we're not
even really 24 hours barely 24 hours in and the president is already pushing
Congress for several major changes right I think President Trump rook now has the
world record for injecting politics into the aftermath of a terror attack that is
exactly what has happened in the last 12 hours tweeting about this and then if
you look at his comments that he made at the beginning of his cabinet meeting in
addition to work regarding the US justice system as a joke and a laughing
stock he also called about CNN is a call for a sweeping changes to the nation's
immigration system I am bothered by an attempt by anyone to try to politicize
this situation that plays right into the hands of the terrorist look the last
thing the president or anyone else should do is politicize this tragedy we
have to find out what happened here amazingly and tragically in the midst
of what has just happened the United States Congress was about to entertain
two pieces legislation that would have made a bad situation worse this is the
quote-unquote share act which will allow people from other states to bring guns
that are illegal in New York into New York and would make our city more
vulnerable well mr. president there are precious few words for days like this
last night everyone now knows at a concert in Las Vegas Nevada gunmen
opened fire on a crowd of 22,000 killing at least 58 fending hundreds hundreds
more to the hospital today were filled with shock and horror sadness and rage
horrific massacre was perpetuated by an American on his fellow Americans and the
visitors from every corner of the world were the very lifeblood of Las Vegas and
were left with many questions whose answers will be seeking in the coming
days and weeks out of this monster acquired the arsenal be used to rain
down death on a crowd of innocence so there's a bunch of Democrats who don't
want to politicize the truck attack because it was radical Islamic terror
but immediately wanted to politicize the Vegas shooting because they could
blame a gun David I'll be honest I've had to learn patience my whole life I've
been dealing with lack of patience but I cannot stand CNN that is the scum of
news and then I have to sit here and look at the scum of New York like Cuomo
de Blasio and Schumer I mean I'm literally like it's like I want to pull
my hair out just dealing with them well you know it was Jim Acosta who is
saying the president has broken all records to inject politics of course
that's not true but what he was focusing on was the person who committed this they
always focus on the tools they talk about guns they talk about vehicles
they talk about the internet because it was the internet that radicalized him
not Islam video that caused Benghazi David that's right so they don't
complain that Hillary lied to the Gold Star family about that though that's
right we got to get rid of the internet we got to get rid of your ability to
freely walk about in public places we got to get rid of the vehicle the gun
but we cannot talk about the diversity lottery we have to pretend that
diversity is more important than anything and guess what we had eight
people sacrificed on the altar of political correctness that's really
what this was about and five of them say that five of them were from Argentina
where they had a vigil yesterday so you know I mean you want to talk about
multiculturalism who's gonna want to come here when we're being attacked by
terrorists please please New York I'm begging you please rid yourself of the
swamp rats Cuomo de Blasio and Schumer those are the most disgusting human
beings in government disgusting

Watson he's constantly constantly fighting back against the left liberal
double standard Paul thanks for joining us today good to be back going well Paul
you unfortunately have to bring to light the truth about a lot of these terror
attacks a lot of these events they happen in Europe they happened in America as
well and you're really just trying to fight back against the mainstream
television news that doesn't want to give the full story in the name of
political correctness well exactly and I mean that's it sounds like just to
cliche at this point oh all this terrorism is happening because of political
correctness but we know specifically this is why this attack happened this guy
came in on a diversity visa this bizarre program where people are just
selected at random Trump's trying to end it Schumer supports it they're gonna
fight him tooth and nail on that so we've got another specific example we've
also got coming out today Owen headline New York attack suspects family was very
mysterious neighbor says the neighbors said they knew he was planning something
this is in the article they knew the immigrant was plotting an attack long
before long before he allegedly plowed his rented truck in down a bicycle path
killing eight people that's what the article says that's a report these
neighbors knew he was planning something San Bernardino the neighbors knew they
were getting strange deliveries they knew something was going on in that
instance we reported they didn't tell the authorities or the police because
they feared they'd be called racist or Islamophobic Owen so yet again we have
another case not just with the visa but with the neighbors before and this is a
closed community again one of these Muslim closed communities we saw it
after the Paris attack the terrorists escaped back into Molymbique Brussels all
the neighbors all their friends knew they were there they shielded them
protected them for three months after they carried out this massacre so yet
again we have the same telltale signs coming in after this attack Owen and
then I don't know if you've covered this but I mean we can get onto it Jake
Tapper you've played the clip or Alex has played the clip obviously of him
saying that Alarak bar could be beautiful immediately after we're talking
probably within an hour after the attack happened saying that Alarak bar could
be beautiful he's now denying he ever said that and claiming that Fox News and
Info Wars are lying about him but he never said it Owen when he's on tape
saying it and I think we can go to that clip if we've got it yeah actually we've
got that clip here's Jake Tapper loving loving Allah who Akbar police have now
talked to their sense they're telling police that they heard this driver saying
yelling Allah Akbar Allah Akbar during this incident to believe that this is
as a result that this is now a terrible is taking over this case because it
appears now that this is terrorism the Arabic Chanda God is great sometimes
said under the most beautiful circumstances and too often we hear of
it being being said of moments like this I'm sorry to laugh at Jake Tapper he's
just such a joke actually Paul so not only did he never say Allah who Akbar is
beautiful even though we just heard him say it I'm gonna take Jake Tapper's
word I mean you know I should trust Jake Tapper fake Fopper so even though I just
heard him say Allah who Akbar is beautiful he said he never said it so
I'm not gonna believe that he that he said it because I trust Jake Tapper but
did you also know that Jake Tapper basically did a whole segment breaking
down renting trucks should we be able to rent trucks what type of truck I mean
they did a segment breaking down the truck the truck we've got to combat that
deadly ideology of trucks I mean I mean these trucks are out of control Paul but
I mean with this Allah Akbar thing he's now claiming the moral high ground Fox
News about a story called Jake Tapper says Allah Akbar is beautiful right after
NYC terror attack that's what he said it's on video no he didn't know he didn't
I just played the I just played the clip Paul even though he said it he never
said it he said so and all these buddies at CNN are like this is disgraceful
Fox News deleted one of their tweets you had one of the congressman shit
Jason Jason Schaff it's what did what why did Schaff is causing yeah
apologizing saying oh I'm sorry no Jake Tapper you said Allah Akbar could be
beautiful literally within an hour after a terror attack where the frigging
Islamic terrorists shouted it while people were laying face down on the
floor bleeding to death I don't think they probably thought it was beautiful
did they oh and when when I heard him say it no I know he never but see but
that but you know what you see you just put it into perspective there Paul
that's exactly it okay what do you think the victims were thinking after they
heard oh Allah Akbar yeah I'm sure that's beautiful oh it was a truck all
those nasty trucks they got us again those trucks no this is radical Islamic
terror and this is a leftist policy the diversity visa program the we're
dealing with mentally retarded people Paul we're literally dealing with
mentally retarded people running our government oh my gosh another segment
Paul just watch on their side let's get back into the actual attacker and some

you're listening to the alex joneshaw
from the front lines of the information war it's alex joneshaw
welcome back to the alex joneshaw and shroyer here filling in for alex today
we got paul joseph watson with us and we're talking about the new york city
terror attack. it was the truck it was the truck Paul what's interesting about
this as you talked about in the last segment the story from the LA Times
New York attack suspects family was very mysterious according to a neighbor
they're saying that they had an idea that he was up to something this also
wreaks like the sand Bernardino shooting where because of political
correctness they didn't want to say anything even though this ended up
killing eight people and driving a truck through pedestrians right after a
school day but it's weird because people at the mosque are saying they
understood his motive so it sounds like he was motivated to do this they're
reporting he had the plans he was planning bigger attacks but his wife
though Paul his wife is shocked oh his wife had no idea Paul what she can't
even believe it he was he was just of your local friendly uber driver that
remember that was the first quote that came out from one of his friends you
hear that after every single attack oh we never knew he was so friendly he was
so nice of course they knew often it turns out later on some of them are
involved in the plot you mentioned the the guy at the mosque and by the way
there are islamo files islamo fascist apologist all over twitter saying he was
just radicalized on the internet there's no connection to Islam whatsoever he
didn't even go to a mosque yes he did go to a mosque we know the name of it and
then the guy who's in the newspaper article in the Daily Mail talking about
how he went to the mosque as you mentioned said that he totally gets why
he did what he did before ranting about George W. Bush's foreign policy in the
Middle East so because of what George W. Bush did that means innocent young
people and tourists on their bicycles in Manhattan yeah most of the Argentinian
rush yeah yeah absolutely no connection whatsoever of course they always trot
this out oh it's a reasonable response to u.s. foreign policy now the vast
majority of terror victims are Muslims killed by other Muslims so no
geopolitical foreign policy isn't the only element yes it is one part of it
but it's not the only element the other thing going today is after Trump came
out and said that this guy should get the death penalty a bunch of people and
some of them like verified liberals prominent people on Twitter came out and
said how dare Trump call for the death penalty that is lamaphobic why didn't he
call for the death penalty for the Vegas shooter well maybe because we're
sending him to Guantanamo yeah maybe because he was dead yeah maybe that's
why he didn't call for the death penalty I'll read a tweet this is from Elpham
Katami this is verified liberal on Twitter send him to Gitmo Trump says
referring to Saipoff he said no such thing about the Vegas shooter who killed
58 people yeah he said no such thing because Stephen Paddock was dead he
can't kill someone twice you've got other people saying quote I don't see real
Donald Trump calling for the death penalty for the Las Vegas terrorist
shooting rampage blatant Islamophobia this is the level of sheer lack of
intellectual debt that we're dealing with I honestly the way go ahead well I
honestly I can't even we're literally dealing with mentally retarded people I
mean there's no other way to describe this I mean I and I'm including Jake
Tapper and Don Lemon in that group as well blocked me on Twitter now Don
Lemon Jake Tapper has blocked me on Twitter you must be you must be heart
broken absolutely crushed I was actually attacking you on Twitter he was
quoting he was teaming up with his buddy Oliver Darcy who won't respond to me on
the DMs well I was talking to him before he won't respond now unless they're on
the high horse thing look Fox News got this disinformation from info wars look
at this sewer pipe he never said alirak bar is beautiful are you deaf the hell
is wrong with you it would be like after Charlottesville of course we've
disavowed the alt-right completely the left never does that with Antifa but it
will be like after Charlottesville if I came out got on YouTube or got on this
radio show and said oh but the Confederate flag can be beautiful if
that's the first thing I said 30 minutes after that girl was killed in Charlottesville
do you think the media would have been jumping down my throat or if Alex had
said it would have been jumping down his throat they would have been all over
him Jake Tapper can say this and now he's just claiming he never even said it
this is completely Orwellian saying Fox News is bad I'm bad and info wars is bad
but playing a tape of him saying it what is wrong with these people Paul
honestly I don't even know it's like beyond Tokyo rose like Tokyo rose telling
people in Japan we're winning we're winning there's obviously an element of
that going on people trying to trick the American public into thinking that
Trump's losing the Trump movement is winning even though it's just having
devastating victory after devastating victory the Trump movement is kicking
ass it's nowhere near stopping it's gaining momentum in fact so you got all
these Tokyo roses out there in the media that are trying to spin it but but again
like you're talking about this is this is beyond Orwellian this is literally you
have to ask yourself are these people on air literally that mentally deranged are
they I mean you know is it that bad do we have such a mental health crisis in
this country that literally we're putting people on air that are are
seriously mentally ill or are they that corrupt Paul I don't know if you saw the
story but and I believe it was NBC News the crew is looking for the story saying
that they admitted the New York Police Department actually investigated the
killer's mosque before there it is listen listen to this headline listen to
this Paul mosque where New York City terror suspect worshiped was target of
controversial New York Police Department surveillance effort so it's still
controversial even though the NYPD had the right mosque they investigated the
mosque where this terrorist worshiped they had their finger on the pulse they
should have pulled the trigger on the guy and maybe they could have saved lives
and what does the mainstream news say it was controversial so it's not
controversial to mow down people in a truck it's controversial to investigate
those people now no exactly I mean I said it in the video from what I saw on
Twitter in the media aftermath of that attack obviously all the Islamophobic
crap oh but what about the Islamophobic backlash there's never any Islamophobic
backlash you had things after 9-11 where some Sikh people got attacked because
people at dormant they think Sikh people are Muslims some shops got bricked
after 9-11 that after that there's been no substantial Islamophobic backlash
after any of these terror attacks throughout Europe or America but that's
the first thing they go to to shut down debate and discussion of Islam I mean
now you've even got a Forbes writer being more offended over the fact that the
EPA chief is reading passages out of the Bible she said the fact that he was
doing that is quote scarier than Allah Akbar she said that the same day of the
terrorist attacks well yeah I mean I could pull up a wait zero stories of
someone saying Jesus is is Lord and then running people over there's no stories
of someone holding the Bible in the air and then murdering a bunch of people in
the name of Jesus Allah Akbar Allah Akbar then you're you know you could
have at least eight to do you know 500 people dead but you know it's almost
like 9-11 never happened to these people Paul you know I mean again we
don't need to get into what actually happened on 9-11 but the official story
is radical Islamic terrorists hate our country hate our way of life want us all
to die want to stop the Western influence on the world but then they just
kind of sweep that under the rug as if that never happened and now it's Islam
is good they don't hate us don't be Islamophobic don't be racist be a good
liberal bend over and be raped by us and die that's what they want they want us

you're listening to the alex jones show
it's honestly it's honestly hard to talk about this stuff on a day-to-day basis
and to cover it on a day-to-day basis and the madness the insanity will will
drive you insane because you've got people that are consciously trying to
destroy humanity destroy this country lie to you brainwash you and then you
have their minions that have the same characteristics of hate and victimhood
but they're just brainwashed minions now it can all be kind of summed up with
Snoop Dogg putting out a new album cover that says make America Crip again and
then has Donald Trump's dead body as he is standing over it with a drink in his
hand so a imagine if a country artist did this with Obama's dead body okay you
would have such outrage that you couldn't even CNN and MSNBC wouldn't
even stop covering it for a month but this is the truth about it Paul this is
what I think the American people can see from this and again it's so frustrating
because I know they're losing I know that this is the Tokyo Rose I know that
this is their desperate last stand but it's just it just hurts me that people
are so hateful and so ignorant it honestly hurts me but when we say that
they want you to die when we say they want to turn America into a third world
gangland it can all be summed up in this one album cover make America Crip again
what is Crip the Crip is a drug-dealing gang of thugs what is a dead body doing
on the cover with Trump as the dead body they want Trump dead so they want to
kill you and they want to make America a gangland again Paul how am I supposed
to how am I supposed to respond to this but where the hateful ones I mean where
where the vindictive at spiteful bigots that really want to go out and
yeah we're the ones that oh no no Paul actually Paul just hit it on the head
you right Paul we're the ones that won't accept the results of the election
that's us and when they go low we go high oh wait no that's them too isn't it
oh wait no they're the ones that keep going lower and lower and lower and
lower and lower and lower and lower these people literally will go so low
until they reside in hell yeah every time they come out with the same line
which is oh Trump's being so divisive Trump supporters are so divisive no
that you can stretch it back right to what Neil after a year before the
election they were sending in people to beat up Trump supporters at his own
events we've seen this assassination fetish dominate cultural institutions have
put this out you had Buzzfeed we got the internal chat logs of Buzzfeed writers
joking about Trump being assassinated though a major journalist like
Indian Eye of the London Times Monisha Rajesh of the Guardian you even had a
so-called conservative Ross a doubt hat of the New York Times all making jokes
or in some cases directly calling for somebody to assassinate Donald Trump but
where the divisive ones where the hateful ones Cathy Griffin can hold up his
decapitated head but where bad where bigoted where hateful and then you've
got Snoop Dogg here's a guy whose career had completely fallen on its on its
backside as of about 10 years ago he's gone through all these ridiculous
reinventions of his image to try and grasp back some kind of relevance
failed his last album didn't even get into the top ten supposedly one of the
biggest hip-hop rap stars of all time can't even break the top ten with an
album anymore and basically anyone can do that who's anyone right now so his
career is failing so he's desperately trying to claim back some relevance and
we're helping him to some extent that's the irony by and broiling himself in this
Trump assassination fetish for the second time Owen in six months he put out a
video back in March where he shot a mock Trump dressed as a clown it looked
exactly like Trump in the head so it looks like get some new ideas already is
this literally all you've got you want to kill Donald Trump yeah we get it we
get it's new now do you have any actual talent left to reach out to people where
people are gonna buy your record because it's a good record or are you gonna
resort to this assassination fetish creating more division more hate in
America he's gonna go back to that every time because he's got no talent anymore
nobody cares about his music anymore this is the only way he can get in the
news well and I'm beginning to wonder if Snoop Dogg wasn't just a controlled
asset from the very beginning when he was introduced into the hip-hop market
because he's never I mean Snoop Dogg has never really been a guy to get
political he's usually a guy that just you know smokes weed and wants to chill
now the sudden he's political all the sudden along with you know everyone else
in the establishment music industry so my question is I'm wondering if these
aren't just controlled assets whether it be the CIA or what have you that are
basically being told hey you want to sell another album you want to continue
to get record deals you better do something anti-trump you better do it
immediately otherwise you get nothing well I mean that's we've seen that
before people get dropped from record labels for expressing any kind of
opinion that goes against the grain I highlighted in my video about Eminem when
he came out a few weeks ago another ailing 40-something rapper whose
career is basically over at this point attacking Trump Trump as of five ten
years ago all these rappers gave him shout-outs positive shout-outs in their
songs and in fact I put a medley together in that Eminem video where it's
all Trump this Trump that he's done so well he's so great he's got so much
money you know rich like Trump yeah you only got to like a quarter of them you
didn't even play all they all loved Trump until he ran as a Republican and
until he defeated Hillary Clinton they used to hang out with Trump Snoop Dogg
was at the roast you know those big roast they used to do those TV roast he was
one of the main people hanging out with Trump they all love Trump Trump used to
hang out with all these black community leaders raise money for them oh but
suddenly he runs as a Republican defeats Hillary he's a racist and they're all
attacking him it's so frigging transparent and now he's back again the
problem is some people might act on this because you go on Twitter every day
oh when someone gonna kill Trump I'm gonna pop Trump you had Mike Cernovich
somebody lobbed a death threat at him the other night you had Michael Sanford
tried to assassinate Donald Trump before the election this was a British
social justice warrior who was radicalized by all this mainstream
media rhetoric about Trump's and bigoted racist literally tried to grab a cops gun
at a vent and shoot Trump in the head the media buried it and said oh he was
just a misunderstood kid so people have acted out on this they are gonna act out
on it in future that's why it's dangerous and they're causing the hate
they're causing the division while we get blamed for it yeah and real quick
yeah real quick I'm just gonna put a conspiracy theory out there I'm gonna
say that the New York terrorists who drove the truck into the crowd of people
was motivated by the Democrat ad that showed the guy with the truck with the
Confederate flag running down kids I'm gonna say that he saw that ad and that
motivated him to run people down the streets because I don't want to be
anti-Islam and Islamophobic so I'm gonna say was that ad that motivated him
but I'm just curious Paul again is Snoop joking like does he really hate
Trump does he really care about Trump is he even friends with Trump and behind
the scenes saying look Donald I'm sorry I have to do this for my career you know
I got a family I got these bills like I just I'm sorry Donald I just have to do
this or because I don't there's no reason for these people to hate Trump
there's no reason he's done nothing he's literally done nothing to these people
he was never in politics all he's done is created businesses created jobs created
markets created skyscrapers there's no reason they all love Donald Trump oh but
now all of a sudden they hate him it's just like I mean should I stop being so
upset about this should I just laugh this off should I go hang out with Snoop
dog and do all the drugs because everything's just a joke to Snoop dog
I mean I just I mean they're just gaslighting me and it works I guess I
think you have to remember that he's catering all the people who tell him
what to do which is probably what it is at this point he's catering to an
audience which is not the brightest let's just put it that way and you can see
that from the comments when I made a video about Snoop dog being an idiot
back in March when he did the first stun so they're catering to very stupid
people he's been a political tool for several years come on diesel why you
call me stupid isle it's Paul joke wit Paul Joseph whistle on info wars diesel
here with Snoop diesel we're gonna take a quick bristle but when we come back

that's info wars life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
welcome busy to info whistle oh and shizzle here with paul joe dizzle we're
talking about make america kripigan isle because we want to make america a
gangland busy what's up dizzle so i was just informed isle that the make
america kripigan with snoop dog looking over trumps dead body has now been
removed from instagram because of the backlash it's so funny these these
i don't even know what to call these people mental defective we need to come
up with like a new word for them honestly paul i don't know what we can
we'll figure it out eventually but they keep having to remove this stuff from
their social media because of the backlash coming from the people that they
actually want to buy their albums or buy their products do you think they'll
ever learn that they're in the minority as far as their trump hatred is
concerned isle well i think if you look at hollywood they're starting to learn
that already from the fact that all their films are complete flops you have
the matt daemon george clueless daemon say it right it's matt daemon matt daemon
suburbicon no matt daemon matt daemon there you go isle isle shizzle but
matt daemon was behind suburbicon with george clueless which again portrayed
you know middle america flyover country trump supporters being all racist blah
blah blah get any frigging narrative and it completely failed all these
virtue signaling hollywood films are failing the ones that have a kind of
throwback more libertarian feel are really doing well in hollywood the more
independent ones that we've seen recently so they're starting to lose the
culture war that's gonna be magnified by all this hollywood wine steam fallout
and yeah but you're talking about it being banned on instagram i don't want
it to be banned i want people to see how stupid well they did and hate it wasn't
banned they took it down yeah of course it's a whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa they
were calling for trumps death you don't ban that calm down but again they're
doing it to create the outrage to then make themselves look like the victim they
always do that they'll probably cite threats made against snoop dog now
without mentioning the deluge major made against trump on a daily basis they
want to create the outrage i just want to hold it up and say look this is
absolutely stupid and ridiculous and like kathy griffin they always come back
and try and play the victim after there's a backlash remember her crying
press conference so don't give them that victory just laugh at them yeah that's
the key to all this just continue to laugh at them no i think you're right and
i get so upset over this stuff because i know what it's doing to our country and
it's it's honestly just an attack on innocence and people that have no idea
what's going on but you're actually right because this is only hurting them more
people that see this the more people are going to come to trump side and i just
don't think they're ever going to learn paul i really don't think they really
assume that everybody goes and takes a steaming pile of you know what and then
sniffs it just like they do they get high off their own you know what and they
assume that everyone else in america is just like that but i think they're
quickly learning that actually people in america are not like that and they
don't like your constant hatred of trump and the more they put that out there the
more people i think will end up on trump side well exactly they're ridiculing
their own audience i mean and it hasn't worked it didn't work before the election
they create this wave of antagonism with this nearing metropolitan liberal
elitist attitude added to you know huffington post new york times hillary
has a 98 chance of winning sheer overconfidence sheer naivety combined
with this unbridled arrogance and hatred of ordinary people which you see
across the board by the way you see in in my own country the united kingdom the
sheer hatred the sheer snobbery directed against white working class people and
that's what you've got with the backlash with trump so if that's not all they've
got is oh let's kill trump isn't it funny haha then they still don't have an
actual argument or any policies that are going to resonate with the american
people you've had top democratic operatives who worked for bill clinton not
trump supporters come out recently and say he's a shoe in for 2020 because the
democrats have still got no policies and they still think that just smearing
everyone as racist is a winning election strategy newsflash 2016 happened it
isn't so carry on carry on portraying donald trump is dead it's not working for
you it's just making see people see how ridiculous desperate and stupid you are
that you have to cater to this vile tone in modern-day politics while they of
course accuse us of having a vile divisive tone it's not working didn't
work won't work again carry on that they'd make it's like don't interrupt
somebody who's who's scoring an own goal right just let them carry on we
should be celebrating this yeah yeah just let them score in their own basket
essentially all day long but the crazy thing I don't know about it in in
Europe Paul I would imagine it's the same thing but here in America the
anti-weight the anti-white hatred this hatred against white people is from 95
percent white people when I go out on the streets and I have a bunch of people
telling me I'm an f-ing white male or white male privileges the biggest
problem white men are the terrorists white men is the face of evil it's
always coming from white people what in that I mean what so what do you do with
that well to boil it down even further it's coming from actual privileged
people like I've hung like my parent my dad got up at 6 a.m. for 30 years and
went and worked in a factory okay they didn't have any privilege all right I
worked my way up I had to work hard I get people who I'd socially fraternize
with occasionally and they're constantly lecturing me about my
privilege and how colonialism is evil and how I'm to blame for it when that
they were literally in the best schools okay they had to work for nothing they
got everything handed to them that the most privileged people you can imagine
across the board white black whatever doesn't even matter and yet they'll
lecture me about my privilege when I didn't even have any and that's the
snobbery I was talking about before which is even more noticeable in the UK
where they will just treat working-class white people like absolute crap and there
was a case on Twitter where this woman tweeted out a picture of some builders
in like construction gear just going into a cafe and getting their lunch or
whatever and she was like oh there are only two GCSEs between these guys GCSEs
being a high school qualification and it's just that level of snobbery we see
it all the time talking about white people I win we've got this four chance
done I don't know if you've seen it where they launch oh yeah okay to be white
where they just printed out the words it's okay to be white plastered them up
in public places totally legally and it caused absolute outrage from people who
are now all over Twitter saying oh no it isn't okay to be white exemplifying
proving their point that there is this virulent form of anti-white racism that's
now dominating the far left the regressive left and they're only proving
their point by the fact they got so outraged over this and they think it's
it's part of this white supremacist takeover it's only played into their
hysteria even more so here's what needs to happen because I'm sure a bunch of
those people on 4chan listen to this show now now here's your follow-up
experiment it's okay to be black put that in public places see what happens
it's okay to be Muslim put that in public places see what happens there's
your social experiment you will find out that it's only okay to be white is
receiving backlash being torn down people shooting videos people getting
offended and it's all because you're white and Paul you know that's the other
thing that really bothers me too and I'm not I'm not gonna sit here and talk
about myself it's just when all these people say oh white privilege oh you're
a white male you've never had to deal with any hardship never like you don't
even know me you don't know about my history you don't know about my family
you don't know anything about me and yet you're sitting here making all these
assumptions about me because I'm white it's like if you actually sat down how
I have a conversation with me you might find out that whatever you're assuming
about me is completely wrong but there it is that's their inherent racism that's
what they don't see they are truly racist people in fact here I mean again but
they're all white they're white well the fact is I'm there self-loathing people
we saw a same the similar thing with the whole male feminist thing I've been
called a misogynist a woman hater a sexist for years but criticizing third
way feminism which by the way the vast majority of American women don't agree
with anyway so it's not criticizing women it's criticizing an ideology just
like criticism criticizing Islam is criticizing an ideology but you'll
notice a lot of these sexual abusers that have been exposed in the media
especially over the past three weeks were all prominent male feminists they
were the people who were lecturing me and Alex Jones for years saying we hate
women and we're spewing hatred towards women by criticizing an ideology while
they're literally physically assaulting sexually abusing women while
proclaiming themselves to be big male feminists so it's the same thing any
every time they're transposing their inherent guilt and self-loathing on to
you because they're fundamentally unhappy people we've seen that over and over
again by the way they're all manic depressives a lot of these big leftists so
again it's taking that self-loathing that's the only way they can get rid of
it is to transpose it all on to us the evil right-wingers when where the most
friendly approachable will talk to anyone as he said you'll go up to anyone
during the process you'll talk to them where the most open tolerant people yet
they have to transpose that evil on to us because they're fundamentally self-loathing
people that's Paul Joseph Watson more of the Alex Jones show on the other side

you're listening to the alex jones show
raging war on corruption it's alex folks sometimes you can encapsulate
everything you're trying to say in someone's response on Twitter and so
that's what we're gonna do now I put out a poll from the war room show which
follows the alex jones show every day and the question was are you willing to
compromise freedom and safety for multiculturalism and diversity this was
retreated by alex jones it's got over 4,000 votes it'll be up for a couple days
yet so again the poll is are you willing to compromise freedom and safety for
multiculturalism and diversity it's pretty straightforward doesn't make any
assumptions it just lays it out on the table and it's a fair conversation and
political debate to have of course but this is how you see the mindset of a
liberal this boils it all down for you folks this response right here so some
someone on Twitter says response to this poll saying does this mean banning white
dudes with guns to okay do you understand what's going on here folks again the
poll is are you willing to compromise freedom and safety for multiculturalism
and diversity the average liberal response is does this mean banning white
dudes with guns to so what am I saying here folks it doesn't matter what you
say it doesn't matter literally doesn't matter the white liberal immediately
goes to racism immediately goes to diversity immediately goes to guns
nowhere in the poll do you find any mention of race at all nowhere in the
poll do you see anything to do with guns nowhere in the poll do you see the word
ban or any sort of phrase that would suggest a ban but that's the liberal
mindset this is the brainwashing this is literally I cannot cut this any drier
than this are you willing to compromise freedom and safety for
multiculturalism and diversity are you gonna ban white dudes with guns to excuse
me I did I say anything about race did I say anything about guns did I say
anything about any bands no that's their obsession that is their religion folks
these are the brainwashed people we're dealing with they cannot live in
reality they cannot even see things for what they are they are so brainwashed by
liberal politics that they inject them into everything it doesn't matter what
you say it doesn't matter who you are they have their agenda and that is to
attack white men to attack guns and to attack anything that they view as
intolerant like a ban so even though there is no mention of guns no mention of
race no mention of bands in the poll that's where the liberal mind goes do
you see the brainwashing now do you see the mental retardation of these people
now because of the media it all can be summarized right here with this one
response from this one liberal again I this this is this is it this is all you
need to see this is the epitome of liberal brainwashing where you put out a
milk toast poll a very relevant topic after a tear attack where the terrorist
was brought in because of a diversity bill and you say are you willing to
sacrifice freedom and safety for multiculturalism and diversity which is
what you'd have to do that's what Chuck Schumer said we need more money for
anti-terrorism forces so okay so now you're compromising freedom and safety
for multiculturalism and diversity what does the good liberal say are you gonna
ban the whites with guns are you gonna ban white men with guns injecting their
identity politics where it never existed now ladies and gentlemen we're running
the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product brain force now

I really just want everybody to take a deep breath and relax and just you know
sit back because here they come again
live from the infowars.com studios it's Alex Junkies
I'm running for president every day Americans need a champion and I want to be that
champion. I don't feel no ways tired. I come too far. I ain't no ways tired.
Is that a dog?
It has been reported you've made five million making speeches the president
made more than a hundred million dollars. What's difference at this point does it
make? What does that make Hillary Clinton to the British family?
My sister-in-law.
I don't know why that's funny.
You are a liar. Another conspiracy theory.
Have you always told the truth? I've always tried to. Always. Always.
I will fight to reign in Wall Street and you know what?
I know how to do it. We came out of the White House
not only dead broke but in debt. I remember landing under sniper fire
it was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but
instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
A little sip. Open up. Come on. Take it. Take it.
It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones who claims
that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs. He even said the
victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors.
Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
Aren't you glad that that demon feces that demon dropping Hillary Clinton
is not the president of the United States? Wow just honestly just thank God
we're not dealing with that absolute witch. I'm being polite.

Clinton? You want to stick your finger right in

infowarstore.com. Now we're running some great
specials but I really want to highlight the DNA Force special right now.
It's 25% off. Now we know that the environment is toxic
and so we provide supplements to fight back against our toxic environment. DNA
Force is one of the most important. New study comes out.
Prenatal pollution exposure linked to decreased telomere length.
This new study found that prenatal environmental pollution exposure
was linked to decreased telomere length measured in cord blood and placental
cells. The second trimester in particular
was demonstrated to be a vulnerable time during gestation. So folks
the environment is now so toxic that even
before you're born you're getting hit with this and your telomeres are very
important to your DNA, very important to your health, your life.
So we knew that the telomeres were essentially deteriorating quicker than
normal so we introduced DNA Force. Now we find out that they're actually
deteriorating before you're born. So we know the environment is toxic.
We know that these chemicals are destroying
our biology. So we bring products to infowarstore.com
that fight back against the polluted environment.
So when you hear about telomeres, when you hear about telomere length
decreasing, just know that infowarstore.com has your back
and we've got DNA Force back in stock 25% off. So
we don't raise the price when the new study comes out
saying that our telomeres are being deteriorated before we're born.
We cut it 25%. So take advantage of DNA Force 25% off while in stock. This is a
very important product to protect your telomeres.
I'm now joined in the studio by Leanne McAdoo
and as usual Leanne you've got Democrats trying to
rig debates, rig elections, blaming the right for everything
as usual but it's breaking and more is coming to light
how Donna Brazil and Hillary Clinton, but I mean mainly Hillary Clinton basically
had the DNC by the political balls if you will,
and Donna Brazil was right along for the ride. Right, well apparently the DNC was
totally broke and Hillary Clinton's campaign used that to their advantage to
say look, deal with us and we'll keep you afloat. We'll keep the
party afloat. Politico actually called it back when
this was first revealed. Essentially money laundering.
Yeah, it's basically money laundering. The same stuff that David
Brock's packs do. But this is a huge breaking story and the
fact that Donna Brazil has been given this opportunity to tell her side of
the story. She's total, I mean the birds are chirping
right now. She's throwing Hillary Clinton under the bus, her campaign, she's
talking about Robbie Moog, she's talking about Debbie
Wasserman Schultz and how incompetent she was and corrupt.
Beyond that, yeah. Right, I mean this is really big time right now that we're
seeing Donna Brazil. I mean I'm curious though why is she
being given this opportunity to give her testimony?
You know, is Mueller looking in to what happened at the DNC? Because as we know
they still, I mean at least as far as we know, they still have not
actually inspected these DNC servers. Well they won't let them. That started the
entire Russia hacking hoopla. But then they don't
even get to get to the source of that main complaint, that main
charge. So this Donna Brazil
expose, she's wrote it for Politico, inside Hillary Clinton's secret takeover
of the DNC and she admits that she stumbled onto a shocking truth about
the Clinton campaign. She found the documents
that proved that the DNC had- Even though we already had it in the WikiLeaks,
Donna Brazil is breaking it now. Right, and she said you know she wanted to,
she wanted to see that maybe some of these documents may have been forged
because that, remember that was the story when WikiLeaks first broke.
The DNC, they were saying- They can't deny that now. They were like oh these emails were
forged and then of course you have your tech people come along and say no I'm
sorry we can look at the metadata and see that these were actual real emails.
Let's see but again though this is why it's so frustrating.
Infowars.com had this story over a year ago. We were already reporting.
We knew Hillary Clinton took over the DNC. We knew they rigged the election
against Bernie Sanders. I guess this is now news because it's Donna
Brazil basically you know the left selling out themselves.
She's finally singing and she's singing like a bird
and she's throwing all these- Kid Daniels had this story last week about how
they're definitely going to take out Hillary Clinton. They don't-
She's going to be the sacrificial land. They don't need her anymore. They don't-
No one's paying $500,000 to her husband for his speeches.
And nobody wants that corpse to speak at their campus or anywhere. That's a walking corpse.
They have no power anymore so now we're starting to see with this
investigation. James Comey was fired. He is no longer
there to protect the Clintons and all of their
Obama administration cronies who have now we're starting to see they've been up
to absolutely no good for the last eight years. And they were all sort of
protecting each other but Comey's out. He's not there. We're going to see
some actions taken against Loretta Lynch. And so Donna Brazil is like look
here it is. I'll tell you everything you want to hear. We'll get to more of this
story just to- I'll tell you the specific documents that she found and how she just-
She was so upset that she had to make that call to Bernie Sanders.
So then all of his supporters need to know that Bernie Sanders absolutely knew
about this collusion and what was going on but he didn't stick up
for the many many millions of people that were supporting him in his campaign.
And donated money too. He immediately told them to just go support Hillary Clinton.
And then they sued and then they dropped that lawsuit even though it was perfectly
legitimate. And again just to be clear here basically what is happening
is because you have these campaign donation limits and because the Democrat
Party was in debt, Hillary Clinton was able to use
basically loopholes or work-around techniques to take extracurricular
donations into- Fundraising agreements.
Into different fundraising techniques and then funnel that money back to the DNC
which it would have been illegal had it come from the original contributor to begin with.
So this is just how the Democrats break the law and Hillary Clinton gets away with it.

Ah, Smiley David Brock. He's a smiley little David Brock. I think David Brock is upset that
Infowars is willing to cover his super PACs, funneling money back and forth, taking a 10%
hit off of it every time. Is that money laundering? I don't know. Hopefully Jeff Sessions will
investigate that. But media matters, folks. Pull up the tweet. So media matters tweets out.
Reporter for Alex Jones Infowars says Hitler is alive and the U.S. government is covering it up.
Now, that's not what I said. I said that the JFK files released revealed that Hitler escaped
from Germany and remained alive in South America. But then there was a response from some other
certified leftist on Twitter, if you guys can find that one as well. Actually, I think I still
have it on my phone if you can't pull it up. Lachlan Marquet. Yeah, nobody's heard of him.
I would like to know how a meth-addled gas attack victim has lived to 128.
First of all, what in the hell is he talking about? Okay? But this is why it's so funny to me.
I see you don't even realize it. I always make a false assumption about these liberals that
they actually have common sense and they actually have the ability to think critically
and to think past level one. They don't. They literally have no comprehensive ability to think
past level one. This is a liberal mind. Okay, so media matters put out a tweet
mischaracterizing what I said about Hitler. They chopped the clip. Doesn't even show the
JFK files that show that Hitler was still alive and the U.S. government noted. The CIA's own
documents. Then this one level one can't get past level one. These people are literally stuck on
level one. If life was a video game, they can't even beat level one says, I'd like to know how
a meth-addled gas victim lived to 128. Doesn't even research it. Doesn't even listen to the clip.
Just immediately assumes things and this is why they can't get past level one, Leigh Ann.
Well, when Roger Stone comes in the studio, I would like you to ask him about is it was Hitler,
was Hitler a meth-addled? Is that who he's talking about? Look, who is he talking about?
What is he talking about? Was that Hitler? Did I didn't know that that was a...
I didn't know Hitler was a meth-head gas attack victim.
I didn't know that.
I really didn't. I did read the declassified government documents that said he escaped to
South America, though. I did read that. Funny how that works. Funny how that... Look, folks,
we're just trying... I'm just trying to break down the liberal mindset and how they literally
are in arrested development and mentally retarded because we're fighting for the people in America
that still aren't politically active, still don't really care about politics, and eventually because
everything is so politicized now, because the force is so strong, they're going to have to
choose a side eventually. And so I just want them to see the side of the left or the liberals,
whatever you want to call them. I want them to see the truth about how weak-minded they are,
how they can't think critically, and how they literally don't even have a foundation for their
beliefs. It's just regurgitate, remake up talking points, and pair it whatever you hear from media
managers. Right, and of course the whole JFK situation was the initial red pill for so many
people in this country. That was the one thing that just drove the wedge where they're like,
I don't believe anything that I'm being told by the government because they're lying about this,
and now we finally have these documents coming out. You know what? I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Reach out to Mark Shan, whatever his name is. Reach out to him. He wants to know. He says it.
Lachlan Marquet, nobody's heard of him, says he would like to know how a meth-addled gas attack
victim has lived to 128. So let's get him on the show. I'll explain it to him then. I'll explain
it all to him how this goes on, and I'll actually show him the documents. So maybe then he can get
past level one, but I doubt it. I doubt it. All right, let's get back into-
Just promise you'll call him Lachlan when he comes on.
Lachlan. Lachlan Markey.
Lachlan. Okay, all right, but let's- on a serious note. So we've got Donna Brazil. She
publishes this story basically outing the Clintons, outing the DNC, outing Debbie
Wasserman Schultz, and the question is why is Donna Brazil doing this? But give us the nuts
and bolts of exactly what was revealed in this article, Leanne.
Right. So she was sent in kind of to take over the DNC to chair it after Wasserman Schultz had
to step down and immediately went to Hillary Clinton's campaign because it showed that she
was corrupt and colluding with their campaign. But Donna Brazil, so she went in to see,
was it really true? Did Hillary Clinton's team rig the election, the nomination process?
Well, what she found, she followed the money, and what she found was an agreement that was signed
way back in 2015. It's the joint fundraising agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory
Fund, and Hillary for America. And this specified that in exchange for raising money and investing
in the DNC, Hillary would control the party's finances, strategy, and all the money that was
raised. So this agreement was signed four months after Hillary Clinton announced that she was
going to run for president. And an entire year before the DNC actually named the nominee.
So she's controlling the money. Now, if you have an incumbent president like President Obama,
where you know that there's no one that's going to try to run against him, this makes it seamless
where the party that's actually nominated will just take over the funds, it makes it easy,
they don't have to go through all the DNC chair to ask about for money and whatever.
But when you have someone like Hillary Clinton and going against Bernie Sanders,
where they're actually supposed to be competing for the nomination, the parties don't get to
control the money, right? Or the campaigns don't get to control the DNC's money. So basically,
individuals who would max out their contribution limit to the campaign could then go write an
additional check to the Hillary Victory Fund. And the states were only receiving like less than
1% of the money that the states were collecting. It was all being funneled back into Hillary
Clinton's campaign. And this is exactly like you said at the same time Bernie Sanders is
campaigning as well, but he didn't know or really care too much about the DNC's money
because he was able to raise so much money through those small contributions. And this is why this
is upsetting because we did have a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters trying to sue the DNC
in a civil lawsuit. But a Florida judge, hello, I'm sure he's Debbie Wasserman Schultz's buddy,
dismissed this case saying that they hadn't presented any real case that there was any
wrongdoing. And let's keep in mind though, this was after Seth Rich died, Sean Lucas died,
and Barrington Wisnant died. Right. And so they dismissed this case. Dissaccoincidence,
I'm sure that they did. Oh yeah, totally. Even though they were involved with this case and the
Clintons don't have a body count behind them. Right. And because again, Donna Brazil does point
out that the email stolen by Russian hackers and then posted online, she continues to just
underscore that that's the reality of it. But again, this is probably all coming out of Mueller's
investigation, which they still haven't to our knowledge investigated. Those DNC computers.
I think that, well, they won't release that conveniently, even though the Russian thing
is such a big deal to them, they won't release their own documents to show how the Russians
allegedly hacked their servers because it's a lie. But actually, I think that you may have just kind
of painted a clear picture for me with that. Maybe this really is the sacrificial period
of Hillary Clinton. Maybe they really are throwing Hillary to the wolves now. And they say, okay,
Donna Brazil, go ahead and out the Clintons, but keep the Russian narrative going. Exactly.
Make sure you put that Russian narrative in there. Leigh Ann, I'll ask you this. And we got
Wasserman Schultz as well is going to go down as well with this whole Imran I one thing.
Well, she's freaking out. Yeah. I mean,
Wasserman Schultz has literally freaked out. But final question, Leigh Ann,
if nobody from the DNC or Hillary Clinton's campaign or the Clinton Foundation that broke
the law, none of them go to jail, is justice dead? Yes, absolutely. The scales have been tipped.
I agree. Time for justice, folks. You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat,

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
The perfect time to be joined by Roger Stone here in studio. You know I was I was kind of
relenting from David Brock and Media Matter saying that I said Hitler was still alive.
Something I never said but then actually it was brought to my attention. Roger I didn't even know
you and Hitler had lunch last week. Only weeks ago. So yeah so it's confirmed now. I mean I didn't
know that you guys were having dinner. Stand by you're about to get the Media Matters tweet.
Roger Stone seen dining with Adolf Hitler. Look I was there. What he said was the recently
declassified documents pertaining to the JFK assassination showed some traffic
among the government communicators that would indicate that they believe that he may have
escaped to South America and died later. So to be absolutely clear Owen Scheuer never said
Hitler was still alive. The question is is David Brock still alive. Hasn't been seen since his
heart attack. But we had Andrew Kerr from Citizens Autodon a couple weeks ago. Clearly Media Matters
for America still engaged in tax evasion and other violations of the federal election law.
Potential money laundering but extremely profitable for Mr. Brock. Extremely profitable.
Well I wonder why he's having a heart attack. Perhaps maybe like Donna Brazil he's seeing the
change of tides and wants to try to save his own skin and maybe try to pull out from everything
that he's been doing with the Hillary Clinton campaign and funneling that money back and
forth between his super PACs. And other non-profits I see that Donna Brazil has a new book coming
out entitled Hacks. I assume it's a profile on her various friends in the Democratic Party.
Oh I thought it was an autobiography. It's not clear but I will I am going to buy a copy however.
Okay so you'll give us the lowdown on that. Roger you know there's all kinds of news right now. I'm
not sure where you want to start. I think that it's incredible though how everybody's trying to
manipulate everything Trump says. Meanwhile they're completely ignoring the bombshells that are coming
out of what Hillary Clinton and her campaign was actually doing the entire election.
Yeah it's pretty extraordinary. Terrific story on Info Wars today by Dr. Jerry Corsi
about Twitter essentially censoring and weeding out anti-Hillary tweets. That's right. Further
grist for the anti-Pedesta as well. You know further grist for the extraordinary lawsuit
that we have coming shortly against Twitter for censorship, antitrust and various other issues.
I've been very heartened Owen by the large number of multinational corporations, big names who've
come forward willing to underwrite my lawsuit. So it's not just you know it's not Roger Stone alone
but it will be you know we will have plenty of financing to bring these culprits to justice.
Is that kind of spurring you along right now the support that you're getting?
Well the kind of first amendment or telecommunications lawyers that it takes for this kind of case are
exceedingly expensive in all honesty pretty much beyond my personal financial capability.
But with the assistance of some major corporations who are interested in fighting censorship I think
we'll be able to put up a formidable battle and I've been looking at the home of the CEO of Twitter
and I'll be ready to move in when I own the company. Are you ready to move in? You're ready
to own Twitter? I definitely am and of course I wouldn't censor anybody. I would let the craziest
left-wing whack job in the world have their Twitter feed. Well they already do. Oh yeah I forgot.
So you wouldn't have to change that. You would just have to let you know conservatives have
free speech on Twitter that would be the big difference. But they censored you on Twitter
and I'm curious though is this the kind of thing that could go beyond Twitter because
we know that the main competitor of Twitter is Gab and Apple Store and the Android App Store
neither one of them will even put Gab on their platform anymore. So they've completely erased
Gab from the competition. Yeah I mean look there's a terrific piece that I have up at Info Wars
right now. It talks about how Twitter erases you as a human being which is what they seek to do.
My wife returned from abroad last night only to find out that her Twitter feed has been suspended.
Curious in view of the fact that she hasn't tweeted in six months and has never tweeted
anything other than perhaps pictures of our grandchildren and other you know personal
things to her friends but never anything political. So I guess this is preemptive censorship. Yeah
we're we're we're censoring her because of something she might say in the future. Twitter
I'm going to enjoy owning you. I really am. I'm going to enjoy this as well. I'm hoping that
you know what it would be great and I'm sure this won't happen but it would be great if Twitter
just came out and admitted what they were doing, admitted their political bias, admitted how they're
trying to censor people that have different political views. Now obviously we know they
won't do that so they're going to give you the opportunity to go ahead and just own Twitter
with this lawsuit aren't they? Well and I think as you correctly point out the folks at Google
are paying close attention. The people at YouTube are paying close attention because they're guilty
of the exact same thing. So I do think the fight will be broad and at the end of the day Google
is the big enchilada. They're the ones who I think have the most to lose but their reprehensible
behavior is brought this kind of legal action and I frankly I think the Trump Justice Department
was already looking at antitrust enforcement against them. This is only going to hasten this.
The president's new appointee to the FTC, very good man, man who clearly understands these
issues extensively. Now on that same page there is a story right now talking about the DOJ potentially
thwarting the buyout of Time Warner by AT&T. Honestly this is something that I don't necessarily
disagree with. I never felt that but you have a different angle as to why that this merger would
actually be good. Well look I think AT&T is far more responsible if AT&T owned Time Warner and
Time Warner owned CNN. I think you get a house cleaning. I've predicted that here on InfoWars.
I predicted it on my Twitter feed before it was unceremoniously suspended. You know Don Lemon,
Jake Tapper, Inna Navarro, bye bye. So wait you're telling me you don't think you don't think
fake Fopper, I mean Jake Sucker, I'm sorry Jake Tapper, you don't think that he would have his
platform to say Allah Huwakbar anymore? No I think fake Tapper would have a hard time to say that
you know the people who bombed in Times Square you know they're merely misunderstood, strange,
very strange. It is very strange the comments that come out of CNN. So does that mean are you
saying that Zucker would be out and it would be a clearinghouse from the top down? That's what I
believe. I think new management would clean house and maybe CNN would go back to being a news
organization. That would be nice. You know today they're a propaganda front for the Clintons. This
is why we euphemistically called them the Clinton news network. You know in the meantime those who
do want to continue to follow my exploits they can go to StoneColdTruth.com or on Twitter they
can go at Stone Cold Truth. I don't I don't run that feed but they do a pretty good job of
covering what I'm up to whether it is the incredible things we've learned in the JFK
documents that have been declassified or whether it is media matters ignores those of course or
whether it or whether it is the lawsuit against Twitter itself. It's the best place to go so you
can still follow my exploits now sooner or later they'll probably block them too even though that's
not my Twitter feed. Somebody set up Roger Stone GOP also not me. They got suspended today. They
got shut down right so well you will not be silenced and you will always be on the war room with us
as well as the Alex Jones show breaking it all down so we'll be sure to follow that but
what Roger just said about CNN is is so true folks look I am a news junkie you honestly
wouldn't even believe it I can't even explain it I I literally monitor like 10 different news every
day I don't even watch CNN and MSNBC anymore because there's zero news value they don't
even cover news it's Trump bashing and all about all day. We're not just going to have to end in

dot com well roger you clean that up a little bit oh i cleaned it up just a little bit so
we've got hillary clinton you know why won't hillary go away because bill and hillary clinton
are the penicillin resistant syphilis of the american body politic i don't may also have
syphilis i don't know a single professional democrat i have many friends who are democrats
who just don't want the clinton's to go away terrific piece i noticed on msnbc today which
points out that as i have said several times here on info wars michelle obama is the front
runner for the democratic party's nomination in 2020 michelle obama would would be without
any question the strongest nominee for the democratic party michelle obama's candidacy
would end once and for all the influence of the clinton's in the democratic party do not think
that there is any love loss between the clinton's and the obamas there is none uh and i'm predicting
again here today michelle obama will be a candidate for president in 2020 and she is the likely
democratic nominee wow big prediction here from roger stone mark that down in the books
so do you believe uh jone rivers that michelle obama is a transsexual i have no views on that i
do know that the machinery of the democratic party is still firmly in the control of barack obama
and if she should choose to be a candidate she would be a very formidable one how do you explain
that bulge in her dress that's a different question that's a different story we don't need to go down
that uh you know i don't know that's kind of interesting because i think the obamas could
potentially be hurting themselves you haven't heard too much from barack but michelle continues
to go out there she's hosting uh demons at her library to read to children i think that the
more exposure the obamas get the less likely they are to win in another election because like you
said it's just like the same thing with hillary clinton people are just sick of them well i don't
think there's as much of a fatigue about the obamas politically as there is of the clintons
both barack and michelle obama continue to pull much much better than the clintons uh you notice
that she is doing more and more substantive issue oriented stuff out on the road um do not underestimate
that the obama stranglehold on the machinery of the democratic party do not underestimate their
ability to win caucuses and primaries if they choose to do so i'm going to stand by my prediction
michelle obama will be the democratic party candidate for president in 2020 and she should
not be underestimated she will be a formidable candidate all right you heard it here first from
roger stone again this is info wars so get tomorrow's news today get next week's news today next
month's news today next year's news today next century's news today at info wars dot com you know
we told you about the jfk cover-up declassified documents prove we were right again now you've
got hillary though back to hillary for a second the demon spawn hillary slams trump for denouncing
islamic terrorism's presidents shouldn't point fingers or divide after tragedies this was hillary
clinton on a comedy show uh last night i'm not even going to give it the time of day to plug it
but roger you know this is the same woman that george bush said was like his sister george
bush started a war based on islamic terrorism but hillary's silent on that yeah it's extraordinary
what's happened to the once great democratic party of harry truman and john f kennedy there was a time
when both american parties for example republicans and the democrats were both anti-communist both
patriotic both pro-american they had somewhat different domestic political views but when it
came to foreign policy they were all american now you have a democratic party that will not stand
up to islamic terrorism will not stand up to islamic terrorism victimizing of people who are gay or
lesbian will not stand up for human rights it's a shell of what the party used to be which is why
i think so many working class democrats uh in places like ohio and florida michigan wisconsin
voted for donald trump and would do so again if the election were held again tomorrow despite the
media onslaught the the unrelenting attacks on our president his popularity uh and his base has
held up all of the sophisticated polling that i had the ability to see when i was in washington
and monday shows that if the election were run again tomorrow he would win again he might even
win by a slightly larger margin the erosion it was in hillary's support oh and that's amazing
considering the the the hatchet job that's been done on the president by the mainstream media
which is why i'm just so perturbed that hillary would continue to do all these media appearance
continue to open her big fat line trap have you ever seen in all of your years being in politics
covering politics have you ever seen a failed presidential candidate that just refuses to
accept her defeat or or his defeat i think this is because the clintons have never had the ability
to see themselves they cannot see how phony they come across they cannot see how disingenuous they
sound they cannot see how um how uh their their public persona uh comes across is so inauthentic
i i thought during the election that this is one of donald trump's greatest attributes everything
he said didn't always come out exactly right uh he isn't polished he he isn't uh he doesn't sound
like he's reading somebody else's words on the contrary he seems genuine he seems real he seems
authentic words and all what you see is what you get he's a real guy and and uh real guys make
mistakes and real guys also uh speak the truth and real guys can inspire everything hillary clinton
ever said was tested focus grouped you could see that she was malving words written by others and
she just comes across as completely phony there's nothing genuine about her she doesn't care about
anyone but herself she doesn't care about anything other than lining her pockets she doesn't have
any guiding philosophy no moral compass she and her husband would steal a hot stove they're not
liberals they're not progressives the sanders wing of the party figured this out they she stands for
nothing but the aggrandizement of the clinton's and the greater enrichment of she and her husband
and her greedy crooked little daughter hillard uh chelsea who is of course the daughter of
webster hubble and she is essentially the king rat of the swamp but what's confusing to me about
this whole thing and this has always been confusing to me when we see the left react to radical
islamic terrorism why is it hillary said hillary clinton slams trumpford announcing islamic
terrorism the stories on info wars dot com right now by steve watson wait a second what happened
on 9 11 roger i i it just it's infuriated me i'll go with the official story i'm not even
going to sit here and debate the official story let's just say on september 11th an event that
was coordinated by osama bin laden radical islamic terrorist killed 3 000 people in united states so
if that's the fact why are you not allowed to slam why are you not allowed to denounce radical
islamic terrorism if they're killing people by the thousands in our country and trying to murder us
and in our way of life why won't hillary clinton denounce that because it would hurt her within
the base of the democratic party because it's politically incorrect to be hardline on radical
islam this was a major factor in president donald trump's election he was willing to call it as it
is uh and the democrats still domain still insist on pushing footing their way around this question
uh if it plays out that way in another presidential campaign you're going to have
the exact same results you know roger politics is obviously a dirty game we know that but
the clintons are just straight up dirty nasty criminal thieves i i i just can't believe that
this woman is still even allowed to not just go on tv but walk freely this woman should be in jail
this woman belongs in an orange jumpsuit behind bars put this woman away before she

america is an information-based civil war that's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets
of america and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying we're
only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship being a conservative
a nationalist a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture

waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
roger i just realized some great irony here reading donna brazil's story in politico
the headline as donna brazil sells out the dnc and hillary clinton as the sacrificial lamb for
what appears to be some serious money laundering and some shady campaign financing techniques
the headline is inside hillary clinton's secret takeover of the dnc i can't believe i didn't
realize this when i first read this headline secret secret this wasn't not a secret to anyone
the entire dump of wiki leaks emails showed how hillary clinton took over the dnc info wars has
been covering hillary clinton rigging the dnc primaries since they began this is how they trick
the average audience roger inside hillary clinton's secret takeover it was a secret even though info
wars told you even though wiki leaks dropped the emails even though project veritas even exposed
the dnc but it's secret because it wasn't reported on until now according to politico
you know if you look at it uh deborah washerman schultz the former chairwoman of the democrat
the disgraced chairwoman right who was forced to step down after wiki leaks published documents
that indicated that they had to change the rules bend the rules to cheat bernie sanders out of the
nomination by the way uh do you know how the california democratic primary came out in 2016 no
you don't you know why they haven't finished no they haven't finished counting they still haven't
found it finished counting you know why that's because bernie sanders won in a landslide and we
have to we have to repress that look i i know donna brazil i kind of like donna brazil uh in
in all honesty on a personal level our politics are really quite different i was introduced to her by
the reverend al sharpton who i also know uh and who i also on a personal level like even though
our politics are completely opposite uh i'm going to buy her book i think it's going to be very
interesting she clearly is coming out from under the yoke of the clinton's now and i think there's
going to be a lot of truth telling there about how the dnc was run but in the case of washerman
schultz uh a a guy jumped in the primary against her two years ago uh uh who's uh name escapes me
at the moment but uh he got 40 plus percent of the vote just based on her theft of the uh of the
nomination from bernie sanders he was a sanders supporter and he's running again and now he has
not only that issue but he also has her involvement with the awan brothers uh and the fact that she
allowed these two pakistani hackers in essence uh access to the dnc computers now what's important
to understand here while they were even in pakistan and what's important here to understand is that
after she was formally informed by the capitol hill police that the awan brothers were under
investigation for stealing data and money she changed their status within the house computer
system from consultant to employee so that their access to the us house of representatives computer
would be uninterrupted that makes her an accessory to their thievery of both data and money so lock
her up debora washam and schultz they're coming for you next we literally have literally books i mean
but it's like we have like an encyclopedia of all of the clinton corruption ranging from bill
clinton's time in arkansas to bill clinton's time as president uh you know selling nuclear
secrets to the chinese selling us out to russia with hillary clinton and the iranian one deal
we literally have an encyclopedia stacks of everything the wiki leagues the project veritas
all just demonizing and damning hillary clinton what winter winter people gonna wake up is the
public so that's what i'm saying will donna brazil's book another add it to the stack of the
encyclopedia showing the clinton the clinton family uh crime syndicate and by the way we're
gonna have a hillary clinton in the next segment where she's demonizing donald trump for saying
radical islamic terror we'll have that clip in the next segment but will the public ever wake up to
how corrupt hillary really is or they too brainwashed if you want to know get the clinton's war on
women by roger stone there's the definitive story on their corruption read it give it to
a liberal friend give it to a brainwashed friend and then either see how brainwashed they are

live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
well it doesn't matter that we just had a radical islam terror attack
alahu akbar in new york city it doesn't matter that we're told that on september 11th that
radical islamic terrorists led by osama bin ladin wanted to kill thousands of americans
and destroy our way of life none of that matters to hillary clinton all that matters is don't offend
the muslims white males are the problem not the muslims don't you get that so hillary clinton
not even what 48 hours removed from a radical islamic terror attack in new york city goes on
the daily show a comedy show a joke show so a joke woman goes on a joke show and demonizes
president trump for daring to call out radical islamic terror talk about what happened with the
event that they are concerned about but not to point fingers not to scapegoat not to try to
set americans against each other and unfortunately that just is not part of our current president
accepts or is willing to perform you know of course you can have his own point of view and and
push his policies that goes with the job but not to continue to divide americans against each other
so he just doesn't have any empathy and you can disagree with somebody over all kinds of partisan
issues but you want to have a president who can try to put himself into the shoes the feelings
of somebody else and he has not been able to what in the hell is she talking about
president trump is putting his his himself in the shoes of people that died because of a radical
out of walk bar and hillary clinton goes on a joke television show with a joke host
we're joined by john rapaport now john i don't even know how to i'm like i i go through phases
honestly in this very demanding mental job that we have here covering this nonsense and this
corruption every day i go through phases i'm like on the brink of a phase now i can't even deal with
this anymore i can't look at hillary clinton anymore i can't listen to her voice anymore this woman
is such a lying demon freak i can't believe that she would get up there and spread these lies
say that trump is the one with a cold heart when she's literally the most cold-hearted woman i've
ever heard of john try to bring me back to earth here man because i can't i'm literally fuming
that hillary clinton said this stuff well as you know and as uh most of our listeners know
this is the tactic of the people who are trying to demolish what is left of the united states
they blame their crimes and their point of view and their state of mind on other people
so whatever it is that they're guilty of they will tell you that somebody else
in this case their enemies are guilty of that's their strategy it always has been
it's the msn strategy of news we're lying so we accuse other people of lying
we're committing crimes and keeping vital information from people so we accuse independent
media of doing that she has no empathy therefore she accuses trump in this case could be anybody of
having no empathy it's just the tactic it's a psychological tactic these people are so embedded
in it that they can't get out of it and they never will be able to get out of it it's now a
compulsion and an obsession with them what am i guilty of okay now i've got to find somebody else
to blame and say they're the ones who did it so this goes on and on how do we because you know i'm
a constitutionalist fully on with the bill of rights i don't want to stop anyone's free speech
but at the same time we have a conservative nature that puts protecting our way of life
and keeping the ideas that created america going and you see someone like hillary clinton
and the the host of the fake news program that she was on literally trying to destroy our country
and destroy the very fabric of truth to literally distort reality i mean how do we deal with this
because i can't stop her right to free speech i'll tell you what john i'll ask the same question i
ask of leon macadoo if hillary clinton or people of her ilk that have been breaking the law and
lying to americans for dozens of years if no one is put behind bars let's say trump is in for eight
years if no one inside hillary clinton's ilk that breaks the law hand over fist steals money
if no one ends up behind bars is justice dead in this country no because it's already been dead
i mean you could ask the same question about the cia you could say well if nobody from the cia has
gone to jail since 1947 when the cia was created and the cia is roaming all over the world committing
one crime after another in serial fashion and no significant figure inside the cia is ever
sent to prison is justice dead sure in a sense it's been dead for a long time but that doesn't mean
that we stop and say there's nothing that can be done can we restore it though oh yeah we're in
this fight as you well know and we're scoring victories every day because more and more people
are waking up and the seesaw has been tilting for quite some time now from major media mind control
to independent media it's tilting in our direction more and more people who are completely disgusted
with the status quo and the way things are done are waking up to the truth and that is called
pressure my friends pressure builds and builds and builds to the point where the people who are
in power can ignore it no longer and they begin to make more and more grievous mistakes tell more
and more obvious lies i remain optimistic that's all i can tell you yeah no and actually i do agree
with everything you said i i actually broke this down on the war room yesterday which is
gonna kick off here right after the conclusion of the alex joneshow when uh john rapaport signs off
you know we are in the in the beginning of the american renaissance and at the end of the day
everyone will end up on the trump movement i'm just calling it the trump movement because that
is the beachhead that is the spear that broke the establishment's armor if you will and eventually
after you know who knows how long it will take i mean the the original renaissance i think they
say took 300 years so who knows how long it'll take now i guess it's just i guess it's just that
we really care about people too much i really care about the truth and justice too much that
sitting here having to watch hillary clinton a known criminal go on television and smear
donald trump for talking about radical islamic terror that just killed eight people in new york
it just makes me so sick it makes my head spin i understand believe me i've been at that crossroad
many times over the last 35 years working as a reporter and uh what i finally came to decide was
you just keep going because what is the alternative you're going to stop no nobody we're not going to
stop so there are these moments when it it feels like it's too much you can't get past it but then
the sun rises tomorrow and you are past it you know and you're onward and uh you have renewed
energy because you know that you're on the side of the truth and what's right and that is a motivation
that can't be uh overestimated it's it's that powerful the establishment essentially the deep
state has dozens even hundreds of tokyo roses out there basically telling to tell the left that
they still have victory and donald trump and his movement is losing even though as you said we're
absolutely absolutely kicking ass it's not even close trumps movement is winning hand over fist
but you know it's just i think that what we're in the midst of right now just like the american
revolution defeated the british world empire that was so powerful nobody thought they could be defeated
america is now back to defeat the global empire america is now back to defeat the globalist new
world order empire that nobody thought could be beat that's what they said about the british empire
the americans beat that guess what globalist we're going to beat you too this is michael david from

you're listening to the alex jones show
hello everybody sitting in for alex in the fourth hour
info wars you know i want to repeat something that i said a couple weeks ago when i was on
because i find that fewer and fewer people understand what free market and capitalism
really means we're not talking about crony capitalism secret backroom deals we're not
talking about globalism we're talking about transfer from you to me from you to you from
you to you product money good support this is the simplest form of exchange at infowarslife.com
you see many products caveman fluoride free toothpaste
on and on and on and on these products help your health
you pay for them dna force 25 off at the at the moment while supplies last
you are freely spending your money to get something good for you and then that money goes to support
the truth at info wars it's that simple it's that free it's that straightforward nobody else is
involved in these transactions that's called the open market that's what kids don't learn about in
school anymore somebody recent article indicates that 43 percent of millennials would prefer to live
under socialism and communism what obviously these youngins don't have a clue not a clue as to what
would really happen to them they think it's all mommy and daddy protecting them and free these
flow in from the sky and from who knows where and all as well all as well but it's not because
they're never educated in the very basics of the free market they don't know what it is they wouldn't
know what it is if it's suddenly reared up and bit them you work you earn money you decide to spend
money on something that you consider valuable in this case info wars life dot com products
that money goes to info wars it's spent on the operation of info wars which is to spread the
truth to wake people up what i was talking about with oland in the last segment to wake people
up and thereby exert more and more pressure on the powers that be and believe me they can feel it
they know it's there get that simple fact what globalism wants to do is to come in and promise
the moon and say you see we understand that you're helpless you're dependent you can't do anything
of course of course of course of course and then as an aside they say well we understand that because
we helped make you that way but you don't hear that part and now that you're helpless and dependent
and needy always needing more and more and more don't worry we'll take care of you
you all you have to do is allow us to erase all borders and nations and create one planet
indivisible with no liberty and no justice for all and then we can take over and then we can bring
in a technocratic society in which everything is ruled and measured and quoted you get this you
get that you don't get that leave all that us we are the globalists we'll take care of you
you that's the new system well gee that sounds great i like that you mean i don't have to do
anything i don't have to work i don't have to think i don't have to exert effort determination
i don't have to have a vision of what i want for my own life yes that's right that's right
it'll all be well it'll all be well and then you get a giant society based on this where
government contracts are feeding and fueling gigantic companies and corporations that claim
that they're making huge amounts of profits yeah because they're in the government trough
which is the tax trough and the invented money trough and we're pulling this back down to the
simplest best system called free market okay i want to shift gears here because for me this is
opioid epidemic week in every venue that i can get access to but for this audience i want to
present some background you've all heard now about the opioid epidemic that is raging throughout
the u.s england and many other countries around the world these are devastating drugs far more
powerful than morphine synthetic drugs that are addicting people that lead to their one of the
things that we can do is look at blister packs as an alternative to how opioids are dispensed
right now and perhaps package opioids in blister packs where it might come in a two four six or
eight west since the year 2000 about 30 000 deaths a year and who knows how much other maiming
and destruction and addiction and so on and so forth that's what we're talking about
but what is the background on that i keep reminding people that this is the globalist
medical cartel at work at the highest levels the medical cartel in the long run is the most
significant cartel in the globalist bag why because through the lifelong treatment from
birth to the cemetery people are diagnosed with one condition after another many of them fake
prescribed incredibly toxic drugs at each stage and then eventually become too
debilitated to think to resist to understand what's going on and they die and that's the history
that's the history that's the history of many many individuals under the globalist medical
cartel as a reporter for 35 years now i've investigated this up one side and down the
other inside out and upside down and there is no other conclusion to draw except that at the highest
levels of power in the medical cartel at the very highest top of the mountain
these people understand exactly what they're doing
that they are waging essentially chemical warfare against the population of the planet
for the purpose of destroying and debilitating populations making them thus easier to control
that's the back that's what you have to understand before we get into what is happening
in the most chilling epidemic that i have seen
in terms of its instant destruction in my 35 years of reporting which is the opioid epidemic

news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host john wrap up
john matt support here sitting in for alex on the fourth hour talking about the opioid epidemic
this is a global alert you have to understand what is going on i've given you the background
in the last segment this is the globalist medical cartel at the highest level toxifying
poisoning waging chemical warfare against the population opioid pharmaceuticals okay
like demoral like percocet percadan oxycontin fentanyl synthetics which are far more powerful
than morphine i stopped counting how many of these opioid pharmaceuticals there are when i got to
fifty there are probably a hundred of them these pills are reaching addicts all over the world
and i'm not just talking about people who have been living on the streets for a long time i'm
talking about all kinds of people in every segment of the population and these drugs sedate
and sedate and sedate the longer you take them respiratory depression shutting down of systems
in the body death addiction destruction chemical warfare 300 000 deaths estimated in the us since
the year 2000 roughly 30 000 deaths a year and it's on the increase a few significant facts
that we have to understand there are yes honest and honorable people working for the dea the drug
enforcement administration who are trying to shut down the illegal trafficking of these opioids in
america and they are being hamstrung and straightjacketed okay because in the year 2016 a law was
passed that contained essentially a secret session section that was voted on unanimously
by both houses of congress and signed by obama that made the dea painted into an almost impossible
corner to stop huge trafficking shipments of opioid pills from manufacturers and distributors
onto addicts the dea can easily spot these gigantic shipments as being trafficking as opposed
to any legitimate medical use they could freeze these shipments but now they are literally hamstrung
by this law that was passed by a secret session a section in that law that must be repealed
the washington post of all people asked obama and former attorney general lynch the bretel
lynch to comment on this law and they refused they refused to say anything refused declined well
it's killing all kinds of people and addicting everybody and the law makes it almost impossible
to dea to act but you know what i think i'll decline to comment on this really this is the
attitude of a former president i think i'll decline to comment on this okay
an insider with whom i spoke absolutely reliable somebody who has been fighting valiantly for years
to put a lid on this trafficking of destructive opioids explained in a conversation with me
about three weeks ago the pipeline how it works okay i'ma give it to you as quickly as i can
imagine this out in the middle of nowhere in a nowhere area where hardly anybody lives in a very
small town there is a little pharmacy and a little medical clinic and in that medical clinic there
are one or two doctors who are writing 50 to 100 prescriptions a day a day for various opioid drugs
every month like clockwork people are flying in from all over the country to this nowhere little
where little place in a nowhere town out in no where'sville to buy prescriptions and get them
filled and fly home and start to sell these to street dealers who sell them to addicts at every
level of society a little pain clinic or a little pharmacy could have on hand at any one time a million
opioid pills a million which they could sell in the course of a year and there are many of these
little operations all over the country where do these millions of opioid pills come from they
come from distributors what is a distributor it is a legitimate company that is in the business
of wholesaling medicines medical drugs of all kinds to pharmacies but in this case the distributors
are aware that they are also drug traffickers and where are the distributors getting their
millions of opioid pills from the pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also aware that they are
engaging in drug trafficking that's pipeline number one there's another one too which i have
time to get to i will but i want you to understand how this works
Purdue pharmaceuticals and incis insys pharmaceuticals have now come under the
scope of law enforcement in america Purdue which made about 35 billion dollars on oxycontin and
opioid ended up being fined wait for it 600 million dollars and several executives prosecuted
criminally ended up with a sentence of 400 hours of community service
that was Purdue pharmaceuticals under the sackler family now john capoor k a p o o r has been arrested
he is the founder of incis pharmaceuticals for also bribery and fraud what these major
pharmaceutical companies do among other things in their racketeering activities
is bribe and pay doctors and so forth to say and researchers to say these drugs are not all that
harmful they can be used long term for many different conditions even conditions that
were not approved etc etc etc this is criminal fraud this is chemical warfare being justified
against the population there is another pipeline and the dea is well aware of it and i have written
articles about this over at no more fake news sightings sources and their comments it's in the
open source literature it's there it's in even the mainstream press underground labs in china
that are making designer spinoffs of a drug like fentanyl much more powerful than fentanyl
and these are apparently coming in illegally up through mexico into the united states another
reason for border control we'll get to the rest of that pipeline because it's very important to
understand the killer effects involved there but we're coming up on a break just keep in mind
underground chinese glass john raffa port see you after the break on the other side
you go to infowarstore.com and get game changing amazing products we've been sold out of dna force

the info war you're listening to the alex jones show
here in our last segment the fourth hour sitting in for alex at info wars
the dea is now admitting openly that many of these opioid drugs which are really designers
spin-offs are coming from underground chinese labs into the u.s. and other countries this is so
serious that they are throwing up their hands the dea and saying we don't know how to contain it we
don't know what to do about it and some of these designer compounds are getting into the standard
toxic opioids like fentanyl and so forth and nobody knows it the dealers don't know it the addicts
certainly don't know it and this can be death not long-term addiction but short-term death
because the drugs are so powerful that's why i'm going into detail here that's why
i'm issuing this alert to everybody who's listening to get this message out there
on top of all of this we have a drug called car fentanyl that is also getting into the pipeline
the opioid pipeline and car fentanyl is an elephant tranquilizer it is thousands of times
more potent and powerful than fentanyl which is already about 50 times more powerful than morphine
and if you know what morphine is you know that it is a powerful painkiller car fentanyl is instant
death if it's mixed into the powder the capsules the pills whatever who is going to know
who is going to know this is happening folks again in the open source
the dea is saying and they're even calling it first responders in other words the people
from law enforcement who are trying to do their jobs who encounter trafficking shipments of these
drugs have to be extremely careful not to inhale them if they have a cut not to allow any of the
drug in there because a tiny tiny amount can cause instant death that's what we're dealing with here
that is what we're dealing with here
people have to wake up and understand this they have to get what is happening here
you know on the other side of this whole thing there are people who are in severe agonizing
pain that need painkillers so what's happening on the other side of the coin many of these people
are finding it much more difficult to get prescriptions from their doctors why because
now there is a tremendous hesitancy and fear inside the medical profession of being accused
of giving out too much of these drugs and so naturally because these people are so stupid
and incompetent they are swinging way over to the other side i know the case because it's been
reported to me by a very reliable friend of a woman who was after surgery in agonizing pain
and her doctors in the hospital were refusing to give her any kinds of serious painkillers
and if it weren't for her husband who was raising holy hell in the hospital almost to the point of
being arrested nothing would have taken away that woman's pain that's the other side of the coin
insanity on both ends this is spreading people this is not diminishing
and as i mentioned in the last segment the dea is hamstrung and put in a straight
jacket by a law passed in 2016 under the obama administration signed by obama
with no comment whatsoever from little brettelinch the attorney general who is in charge of the dea
just let it go by the boards and my insider told me the overwhelming number of congressmen
who voted for this bill from the house and the senate had no idea what they were voting on
as usual they were brain dead they don't read these bills they have no idea what's in them
and there was a secret section in there that made it almost impossible for the dea to stop
gigantic obvious shipments trafficking these dangerous opioids in other words walking into
a pharmaceutical company and saying hey we know from your records that you're about to ship a
million opioid pills to no where town in the middle of nowhere to a small pharmacy so we
know you're a criminal and we're arresting you and we're freezing the shipment can't do it anymore
now the dea has to go through an elaborate process to justify uh and plead and grovel in order to
take action tied up in court pharmaceutical companies who are
operating as killers basically killers are shrugging their shoulders and saying well we're now
well on the way to being immune from prosecution for illegal trafficking as far as the dea is
concerned and so these pharmaceutical companies are plotting and scheming day and night in every
way possible to exempt themselves from discovery prosecution sentencing criminal action while they
pump out more and more of these hideous drugs and addict and kill larger and larger numbers of people
that's what's going on
and it's getting worse getting worse so finally now you hear congress people starting to make
some noises about this well where were you when you voted for the law that hamstrung the dea
where were you where were you when you discovered as early as the year 2000 as i have documented
time and time again that by a very conservative estimate the medical system in america kills
225 000 people every year like clockwork which is 2.25 million deaths at the door of the medical
cartel every decade where were you where have you been you know i've got to maybe wrap this up
i know a lot of people out there and with very good reason and so forth they're always looking
for the most esoteric possible uh means by which people are being attacked in this society
fine go to it you bet absolutely i'm with you but at the same time be willing to look at what's
in front of your nose right now that there is a system firmly planted in the soil of this country
in other countries around the world called the medical cartel which by a mainstream impeccable
meticulous you know all the credentials were there in the year 2000 yearly american medical
association johns hopkins school of public health etc etc american medical system is killing 225
000 people a year and the boys have put up on the screen here's johns hopkins study suggests
medical errors the third leading cause of death in the u.s that comes 16 years later after dr
barber starfield established that medical destruction is at least the third leading
cause of death in the u.s what would you say if one of these esoteric things you could actually
say look here in the journal american medical association if you want to know what the killer
effects are 225 000 deaths a year 2.25 million people in america are being killed every decade
by the medical system and the fda is aware of it congress is aware of it the pharmaceutical
manufacturers who are doing it are aware of it the american medical association is aware of it
has been aware of it for a long time what do you call people who know for a long long time what
their own actions are causing and do nothing about it killers is what you call murderers
is what you call them because that's what they are and that is the most powerful arm of globalism
in the long term the medical cartel thanks for listening this is john rapaport see you soon on
