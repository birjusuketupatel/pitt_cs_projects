You know it's days like these when the plate isn't just full, it's so overwhelming that
I feel like I'm letting everybody down and then I get overheated and I get really really
hyper and my brain speeds up and I get gasped on and the great things to say and I interrupt
them because that's why I always thank you for putting up with me because it's just it
makes my brain explode every article because my brain makes connections in memory to a
larger picture and I'm basically like Robbie the Robot with smoke coming out of my ears
so thanks for putting up with me when I say that because just one of these articles has
hundreds of data points with it that give me chills up my back and then I'm sitting
here at home and last night and this morning and in the office looking at all this and
just every story and the way the mainstream media responds to it and tries to lie is crazy
you know we tell you that we're next year's news today Roger Stone has been saying since
January of 2017 one year ago he has been saying that the key to bringing Obama, Hillary and
all of them to justice is the illegal FISA warrant which they then lied and said they
didn't have first they said they were surveilling then they said they weren't then they said
we were crazy and made it up remember all the CNN clips and it just goes on and on and
I kept saying this is the key to everything I agreed with Roger that the fact that they
were spying illegally on the campaign and then we're doing it when he was president-elect
and then the day he gets elected it's the front page of the New York Times that they
were spying on Trump Tower and then they lie about it to Congress and say it's preposterous
Clapper Brennan Comey in front of Congress we have all the clips we're going to play
in today and now Congress has the classified FISA warrant directed by the president it
wasn't just Comey that went with the fake fuse and GPS the president of the United States
directed that the frontrunner and the Republican nominee be spied on for espionage with no
proof with a fake dossier and then lied about it to Congress and lied about it to the American
people and now it's all blown up in their face and they just hope like Gruber why do
I harp on Gruber so much the top strategist to get Obamacare passed and he said I was
hired to deceive people that this was going to triple prices on average within five years
and I was hired because I'm the best at lying and thank God the public has no memory these
are quotes they don't want you to have a memory and here right here now we have Congress we
have senators we have the FBI coming out it's all right here Congress confident bombshell
FISA abuse memo will be released soon resulting in major criminal indictment of major officials
I believe there are people who will go to jail over the Intel memo worse than Watergate
shocking house Intel memo reveals FISA abuse by senior DOJ and FBI and notice Trump had
this from the time he got into office he doesn't release secret stuff though he's waiting for
it to be released through proper channels law enforcement was so upset they leaked to
us a previous mass surveillance program of Trump all his residences and my residence
and my private office we broke that last year so yeah next year's news today and then it
goes on and on and on and then we have the Roger Stone articles from back in March of
last year Trump wiretapping a scandal bigger than Watergate Roger Stone though after the
fraud of the FISA warrant again that's how smart Roger is the more and more I realize
that guy is scary how dead on he is we've got even bigger news to just stay with us
I'm so excited the new product and for life.com in a glass bottle two months servings filled
to the brim filled to the absolute top the real red pill this is a heart and brain pill
a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulus in it but boy does it stimulate because it's
beyond that quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to
their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people a hundred two
hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formulae working with scientists
and developers non-gmo made right here in America 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen
you add the preglonone to it which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body
has to have to even make the hormones in your glands it is amazing red pill now available
at m4warstore.com and your purchase of the operation the Alex Jones show because there
is a war on your mind it's Friday the 19th day of January 2018 I am your host Alex Jones
Sean Hennedy last night said that the Russia investigation is over and is officially blown
up in their face I agree that it's a double head tap what we just saw the first unstoppable
salvo was all the fusion GPS coming out with the husbands and wives in the Justice Department
FBI a very close-knit group of less than 30 people at the top the deputy director of
the FBI the head of the Russia operations or inside of the Justice Department all connected
by the way to the communist Chinese smoke screening and blaming Russia for their operations
they went in created the fake dossier used it to get the fake Pfizer warrant and now
we know Obama directed the warrant unprecedented beyond Nixonian Congress has the memo it's
classified but they are trying to look at how they're going to release it notice Trump
knew all this day one he got elected he got briefings once he was president that's why
they were so scared on the 20th he could see it all and that's why when he said I think
it's going to come out Obama was spying on me and they said you're insane Comey said
it was insane we're going to get those clips in front of Congress two weeks later was that
early February he said the president pulled the headline Comey it's insane to say that
Obama ordered spying or knew about spying on Trump the spying didn't exist he said and
Obama wasn't involved it was insane there it is Comey called Trump crazy he was both
crazy and insane after Obama wiretapping claims report there it is video from the hill when
did I tell you I told you see my memories it has precision I told you February but I
guess he testified again in the fifth month last year but he also did it in February
so there you go multiple testimonies so crazy insane hearing after hearing after hearing
after hearing and contradicting himself hearing over hearing there was no secret memos he
didn't leak to the press there was a secret memo he did leak to the press perjury perjury
perjury perjury as bad as Brennan saying the NSA has never spied on any US citizen period
it's doesn't exist it's like saying New York City doesn't exist Dallas Texas doesn't exist
your mama didn't exist bananas aren't yellow bears aren't brown skyed and blue there it
is yeah in March Trump's baseless wiretap claim remember the hysteria in January February
March and April and CNN clip Alex Jones is the one he's the insane person that says the
president was being wiretapped and the and the White House is using info wars as a source
think about that the White House wasn't using us as a source Obama was the source when he
was president elect when Trump was president elect they were in the news saying we spied
on Trump and have total proof he's a Russian so Trump goes well it's illegal to leak that
if you have it but I know that isn't true so you're lying also about fake leaked intelligence
which is doubly criminal and now we know it was worse than we thought because they're
dumb enough to even say in memos we got to set the president elect up we got a stopping
because that's in the new FISA they got that when Obama was outgoing then there's a previous
FISA and previous surveillance that wasn't even authorized going on during the campaign
obviously this is unbelievable New York Times needs to come clean on wiretap headline yeah
that was September of last year pointing out that on January 20th one year ago tomorrow
that they said they were wiretapping the president but then again CNN said that I literally made
it up and that there was no reports saying it even though there were thousands so see
my crime is a memory Gruber said we could screw these people over and triple their rates and
rob them thank god they're so stupid and thank god they have no memories a memory is everything
if you're good natured love god have a good memory and are hardworking the universe is
yours and they all bet on you not having a memory and so now we have congressional investigations
we have congressmen and women that have seen the memos they say it the venom is vicious
and that it's Obama directing the whole operation well of course he's the president you don't
think they're gonna carry out stuff this criminal if it wasn't a direct order but for months
and months and months every day of every week last year they said the Trump was in shame
in congressional testimony crazy Mueller said he was crazy Comey said he was crazy everybody
said he was crazy and now it's all imploding Comey called Trump crazy and outside the realm
of normal while the president thought there was something wrong with his FBI director
her toxic relationship revealed and now everything Trump said confirmed in royal flush yet again
congressman confident bombshell Pfizer abuse memo will be released soon will result in
criminal charges of top officials I believe people are going to go to jail worse than
Watergate we're gonna play these clips coming up the next segment but we need to have the
big headline on info wars.com and news wars.com because it seems like nobody else is doing
this we've got to do it yet again I'm not complaining I just don't get how people don't
see the forest for the trees here the headline Trump 100% vindicated in saying he was illegally
spied on because they illegally went and lied with fake dossiers knowingly in meetings
saying it's an insurance policy to then go get a warrant to authorize with parallel construction
what they were already doing for over a year and a half illegally and all that's coming
out so we need to go and show screenshots of the New York Times and the washroom post
and CNN just like I just did on TV your radio listener they're putting up dozens of articles
saying Trump's insane Trump's crazy didn't happen and then it's exactly as he said and
ram that down their throat because that's the medicine to the poison that's the medicine
of the lies of them saying we're fake news the president's insane he's fake he's dangerous
no over and over you'll never have a growth rate of 3% roared past that New York Times
Krugman full of prunes you just won the fake news awards telling America we never be great
again demoralizing us like Tokyo rose in World War two unbelievable and now all of it proven
yet again in your stinking faces take that people ask how can suddenly things one year
later be so much better be turning around so quickly because it was artificial suppression
that's what globalism is China has been picked as the industrial base and the place to have
prosperity for the elite not the people it's an economic war this has been a 21st century
war and guess what patriots just recaptured the country to a certain extent that's all

waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live on the front lines of the infowar
show let's go over the anatomy of one of the biggest frauds and one of the biggest fake
news stories of 2017 that was mainstream media establishment you know what whole media telling
you that Trump was never wired tap period Trump tower was it no one in his entourage
was spied on despite the fact that they bragged that they'd done it at the end of the campaign
and when he was president elect and so here's an article out of newsweek just last year
December 30th did Obama wire tap Trump no but it was just one of the rights top conspiracy
theories of 2017 so this is just 20 days ago they're still saying this didn't happen when
it's all admitted imagine who reads this the most gullible people now if you guys pull
that info wars article back up please I can give them the day thank you here is an adan
solazar article from March of last year when we were hammering them with the truth so was
drudge report New York Times editor blames info wars for Trump wire tap claims after
reporting on wire taps and he goes on to say that I made it up so what they do is when
they want to say something fake they just go oh that came from Jones because they want
to discredit us at the same time turn us into a symbol of falsehood when we're the symbol
of truth that's what we attempt to be and then project the lie again regurgitate the
lie onto Trump and the American people knowing full well his paper ran 20 plus articles in
January saying that they'd wire tap the president and that we've gone over all those articles
just from the New York Times saying it in January alone but as soon as he became the
president he said that's illegal and it's not true and they went you're insane you're
crazy here's the FBI director no one ever spied on you you're crazy then we think it's the
DEA gives us the documents of Trump and myself being spied on for eight years by Obama I
knew it was real database because it was phone numbers I had my private office that nobody
had and it said Alex Jones's private office number Trump's private office number Trump's
private apartment Marlago number and I had Trump's number at Marlago his private number
I'm sitting there going my god this is real and you notice the media didn't touch that
when we released screenshots with our numbers blacked out because they knew it was Pulitzer
prize level information oh Roger Stone convinced Obama administration got FISA warrant to monitor
him and now that was last year early last year April of last year all of it proven and
what did Stone say over and over again next year's news today he said they got illegal
FISA with illegal BS and they spy on everybody including you Alex and including Trump and
his whole family and they're lying about it and they've perjured themselves to Congress
that we have him cut and dry they will go to jail if Trump moves on this and every time
he talks to the president he says sir the FISA court was illegal they had illegal wire
tapping before they lied to do it you've got to go after him you've got him cut and dry
just like they got Nixon for illegal spying cut and dry and now you see it that's why
they hate us folks because we are technical we're on the level with what's really going
on talking to the experts that's why they want to shut down and I just keep saying that
because it's like alert alert alert alert we're you know the base is being attacked
and I just keep going yeah yeah yeah yeah just letting you know that this is going on
in between the information we put out but we're at a red alert level here this is a full
on civil war with hardcore criminals that sold us out of the communist Chinese but Obama's
a communist Chinese agent all of them these people are hardcore criminals and you suddenly
see it in the news Chinese communists have taken over every university Chinese communists
have bought up Hollywood Twitter text the orders of the communist Chinese Google I mean
they tell them what the censor in America all that undercover videos coming out so this
is from March we put the M4's article back up great job finding that there's a bunch
of these videos but here is CNN memorializing the fact that they say that I made it up that
Trump was being spied on and that I was Trump source memorializing what lying scum and by
the way Anderson Cooper is leftist foundation CIA and I can tell you right now that that
New York Times editor unbelievable that these are the enemies of this country arrogant conceited
think they're invincible guess what you're just men like everybody else in fact your
traitorous men you're globalist you were hired because you hate the country you were hired
because you actually enjoy kicking America while it was down well guess what buddy both
of you we're not down anymore we've been stopped pretty bad but we're up and awake now and
we're politically going to get you back you understand that you started it you're going
to get it now scum everything you did to my family everybody else what you've done to
Trump what you've done to the veterans what you've done to the old people all your crap's
coming to an end you got that it doesn't mean some utopia is coming but we're not out to
piss all over the country and break it's back so we can teach you the lesson like you globalist
are let's go to these two traders back in March memorializing the truth because we have
a memory and we're going to keep hammering them when people start going to prison and
they're never going to stop trying to get the president you can't play this game we're
always going to cause a civil war if we send Hillary and all of them to prison Mr. President
they're not going to stop they already started a civil war they've all got to go to prison
they're saying you're a dictator we all need to be shut down take our free speech and then
say you're doing that they've already launched their operations fill muds on TV saying he's
going to kill you all we can do is go after them now turn the dogs loose they started
it they did it they're the foreign power they're the enemy they're the traders get them get
them here's the clip and so there's this bizarre circular thing happening where the president
cites a theory that he was wiretapped which developed on the kind of fringe right wing
media and then there's the New York Times and then after his tweet storm info wars then
started saying well look it was the New York Times that reported it citing our story misreading
our story and now a few weeks later the White House and the president are citing info wars
so they've got one kind of bizarre right wing fringe theory to defend another bizarre right
wing fringe theory both of which there's no evidence to support and just to be clear
there is and correct me if I'm wrong there's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting
in the New York Times that indicates President Obama wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of
then candidate Trump correct nothing I mean if we knew that that is a fantastic story
and it just goes on and on and now we know it's in the Pfizer document the president
directed it himself of course he did I mean you don't just think we thought that right
you don't think that once he was president elected once he was president he didn't get
all that information and you don't just think oh I'm the source for the president how about
the president's the source people are sick man enemies of everything decent just a group
of knuckle dragon thug criminals who thought they could rape this country forever we'll

a pro-life demonstration and true women's march ahead of what's coming up with the george
soros financed situations we're gonna play his remarks and then i'm gonna get back into
just how huge this is right now just how ultra massive this is right now that congress is
now seeing the fiza memos obama ordered it illegally they lied to get it we have their
other memos where they admit it's a set up to get the president then we have them perjuring
themselves to congress last year saying they never did it that's comey to congress i mean
this is major perjury not to mention obama directing spy agencies against candidate
nominee president elect and then leaving stay behind networks in government to try to stop
the return of the country that's been under globalist control we are literally involved
in a counter coup taking our country back it's it's just unbelievable look at the economy
look at everything and then bono and u2 that's gotten millions and millions of dollars a month
really billions of the aggregate billions and billions off of african aid packages and
others and of course he used to give zero point eight percent under criticism he started
giving one point two percent so this is a guy that steals money even bigger than the
clinton's from black people but then he has a virtue signaling video with the kkk marching
at the white house that calls for opening our borders to everybody so they destroy the
third world then flood us i mean it's just again upside down world everything they say
it's the opposite and just look at this monster look at the monsters that are people like
bono that just prey on people it's it's unspeakable so that's coming up right now though let's
go ahead and go to the president's ongoing remarks they're live right now at the women's
march pence is also there here it is thank you very much it's so nice it please we have
tens of thousands of people watching us right down the road tens of thousands so i congratulate

to thank our vice president mike pens for that wonderful introduction i also want to
thank you and karen for being true champions for life thank you and thank karen today i'm

address dress the 45th march for life that's very very special 45th march for life and
this is a truly remarkable group today tens of thousands of family students and patrons
and really just great citizens gather here in our nation's capital you come from many
backgrounds many places but you all come for one beautiful cause to build a society
where life is celebrated protected and cherished the march for life is a movement born out
of love you love your families you love your neighbors you love our nation and you love
every child born and unborn because you believe that every life is sacred that every child
is a precious gift from god we know that life is the greatest miracle of all we see it in
the eyes of every new mother who cradles that wonderful innocent and glorious newborn child
in her loving arms i want to thank every person here today and all across our country who
works with such big hearts and tireless devotion to make sure that parents have the care and
support they need to choose life because of you tens of thousands of americans have been
born and reach their full god given potential because of you your living witnesses of this
years march for life theme and that theme is love saves lives as you all know row versus
wade has resulted in some of the most permissive abortion laws anywhere in the world for example
in the united states it's one of only seven countries to allow elective late term abortions
along with china north korea and others right now in a number of states the laws allow a
baby to be born from his or her mother's womb in the ninth month it is wrong it has to change
this is incredible americans are more and more pro-life you see that all the time in fact
only 12 percent of american support abortion on demand at any time this is too powerful
for my administration we will always defend the very first right in the declaration of
independence and that is the right to life wow he's the first sitting president he's
actually got one of these events he pledged he would he just continues and their sacrament
is this this is the heart of the global stop right exactly one year since i took the oath
of law this is the final and i will say our country is doing really well our economy is
perhaps the best it's ever been you look at the job numbers you look at the companies
pouring back into our country yes you look at the stock market at an all time high unemployment
17 year low unemployment for african-american workers at the lowest mark in the history
of our country unemployment for hispanic at a record low in history unemployment for women
think of this at an 18 year low we're really proud of what we're doing and during my first
week in office i reinstated a policy first put in place by president ronald reagan the
mexico city policy i strongly supported the house of representatives pain capable bill
which would end painful late term abortions nationwide and i call upon the senate to pass
this important law and send it to my desk for signing yes i don't even tell the women
they can just have the baby and get paid by the adoption bridge hundreds of thousands
of dollars don't tell the women that they just want the nation to harvest the baby i signed

You're listening to the Alex Jones show I
Have sworn upon the altar of God
Eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
They take the tissue of the babies and then they grow the tissue in
these fats and
Then they harvest it
They grind it up into vaccine material into flavor testing for Pepsi into thousands of products
We know of we are literally ingesting our own children
And it's done not from a position of eugenics even at the base level to get rid of poor people as it's pushed
And to make society better. No, no, it's done to dehumanize everything and Trump in the times
I've talked to him would say, you know, I know they're targeting churches the IRS
We're gonna stop that and we're gonna stop partial birth abortion
We're gonna go back to the States and and you know, that's constitutional and we're gonna save children
And I said, well, I'm a Christian sir. Yes, I'm really glad that you're saying that
But I still kind of halfway believe the media that he was this big liberal somehow and this was rhetoric
And I'm like, sir, let's get the tax cut stabilize the country and then I'm sure that's gonna be great
But then Trump three or four times I've talked to him brings up the energy at churches and
And and and the people praying
And he talks like especially was in black churches. He's like, man, you feel the energy in here and he's he gets high off of it and
You know Trump didn't used to pick that up in the elite churches
He went to and stuff where it's all just a social gathering and and Trump likes the average people and he's in the energy
positive energy
He's like the opposite of a psychic vampire
you know
I've only been around Trump a couple times and not even really able to talk to him and it's like you feel the energy
same thing was wife was even more energy and
You're almost like
Can't hardly walk up to him. It's not like any Hollywood stars. I've ever seen any of it. It's like when they turn it on man
It's like and the globalists know it and he's been a sleeper cell for 50 years
His dad was a big anti-globalist patriot. They have huge amounts of money in the John Burt society
He fought napkin gat that he has been literally preparing for this his whole life. This is unbelievable. I
Mean this is I just let's say their final thing is abortion
It's their whole cult their whole system and when you go after that like he's doing there's no way
He's with the Illuminati. There's no way. He's with this system. There is no way
No way and he'd be doing this zero zero and of course my gut tells me that too and the churches
Their gut tells them that the real churches
That's why they oh he liked hot women when he's you know, or most of that's made up
Whatever King David, you know had his best friend kills. He'd have his wife. He repented of it later
He did it out of the flesh. He wasn't inherently evil
Trump hasn't done
2100 what King David a man after God's own heart the prototype of Christ did?
But what you judge your man by is the fruits and by the man's enemies and by his fruits and by his enemies
You know this man
So many Christians have said pre-destined to win can't be stopped all this stuff
They feel the spirit and I'm kind of like come on. Let's not be that optimistic and now I
Mean this they're gonna try to kill him. We already know that they're like demons crawling around their bellies right now
Are the pigs running over the edge of the cliff?
when
you know Christ
Tells Legion
Not the name of the demon that we are Legion out of him and they were and the demons run into the pigs
And they run off the edge of a cliff
That's what these people are doing the Democrats the globalist all of them and then they're they're slaves
Because they get the left into this elitism that we're the intellectuals everybody else are country bumpkins
People that believe in God or idiots blah blah blah and then we're gonna run society and we know best
That's your average liberal means well, but above them are really dark controllers who know and
Who are into the occult and into dark energy and into death and into being evil and into being selfish?
And when you pull back and see them
It's sick and you just thank God you're not those people
This is so historic. I didn't know this was gonna happen. They've been rumors of it and just boom it pops up
So I don't even know if he's still speaking because we were playing it live
But but but now we we've got a pause from earlier
I haven't even plugged this hour because I'm just just I can't even plug products in the middle stuff like this
Please support the show in four store.com. We won't be here. Thank you all for your support. Let's go back, but
Presidents delivering you're delivering. There he is today. I'm announcing that we have just issued a new proposal to protect
Consciousness rights and religious freedoms of doctors nurses and other medical professionals so important
I have also just reversed the previous administration's policy that restricted states efforts to direct
Medicaid funding away from abortion facilities that violate the law
Exactly what he told me in the phone a year ago
Oh, see that we are protecting the sanctity of life and the family as the foundation of our society
But this movement can only succeed with the heart and the soul and the prayer of the people a pro-human future
Here with us today is Mary Anna
Donadio from Greensboro, North Carolina. Where is Mary Anna?
Hello, come on up here, Mary Anna
Come
People are the foundation
Mary Anna was 17 when she found out she was pregnant at first she felt like she had no place to turn
But when she told her parents they responded with total love
Total affection total support
Great parents great. I thought you were to say that I had to be careful
Mary Anna bravely chose life and soon gave birth to her son
She named him Benedict which means blessing
Mary Anna was so it pause again parents love and support it pause. That's thanks. Did you see Trump just go?
Doing good and good energy. That's the secret to Trump. He's getting high off of this
He's getting energy off of doing good not off everybody praising him up there
But off of delivering on what he said he would do
When he signed that the the tax cut that that knocked out much of Obamacare he went
When he pushed that thing on every sign that he he see this is this is what being honorable is about
It's it's spiritual it's getting closer to God each time you do good and maybe 30 40 years ago
Trump wasn't that close to God, but he's getting a lot closer and this is all of our journeys. We're talking about here
this is just amazing and
Let's go back to the president as
fortunate as her
She joined with others in her community to start a maternity home to care for homeless women
Who were pregnant? It's great. They named it room at the end
Today Mary Anna and her husband Don are the parents of six beautiful children and her eldest son Benedict and her daughter
Maria join us here today. Where are they? Come on over
Praise in families praising real wealth not hollywood red carpets
This is the opposite of Satanism over the last 15 years room at the end has provided housing child care
Counseling education and job training to more than 400 women
Even more importantly it has given them hope it has shown each woman that she has not forgotten
That she is not alone and she really now has a whole family of people who will help her
succeed
That hope is the true gift of this incredible movement that it brings us together said the family's wealth
See it is the gift of friendship the gift of mentorship and the gift of encouragement
Couragement love and support those are beautiful words and those are beautiful gifts and
Most importantly of all it is the gift of life
itself
That is why we march
That is why we pray and that is why we declare that America's future will be filled with goodness
peace joy oh my god dignity and life
For every child of God it pause again. We gotta go right you to the I told you when I was there a year ago
Before I even tweeted out the New York Times government said how did you know what he'd speak about it?
I didn't I felt it as he's gonna bring God back into the covenant
He's gonna declare that people have value again
He's gonna say that families have value that the states have value that the power is the people and that and and and that
Again, we're not gonna be transhumanists. We're not gonna go down this road and now he's doing a ritual up there of
Loves coming into America decency honor life the family. He's literally engaged in a ritual a
Christian ritual
Saying we're bringing the light back in we're bringing God back in
Last night, I was talking one of the top riders in the country
And I was talking about a big project. We're working on
That's very very important. I'm just gonna leave it that and and and it's a simple thing, but it's key
And it it spells it all out right here I
Said thanks for believing in a human future and fighting for it and we go on to talk about that
We're fighting for a human future

You're listening to the Alex Jones show
He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones
You know the left puts out a lot of different lies they claim the president doesn't mean what he says he's a liar
He never keeps his promises
But that lies kind of receding isn't so ridiculous now. They just go okay. He is keeping all his promises are trying as hard as he can and
He's insane
So continuing with the speech that has been live, but we've been pausing it during the breaks the president at the March for life other presidents
Reagan would never go that was seen as too insinuery
It's kind of in the back halls of things. Yeah, we don't really want all these black people to have kids do a
I'm not saying Reagan was like that, but that's kind of the attitude of the Democrats and the Republicans and oh
You know too many brown people or whatever and that's what what Margaret Sanger and the left's all about so they want to manage the left
So you make sure they kill as many brown people as possible while using those that live as weapons against the whites to have total control and
Then George Herbert Walker Bush wouldn't do it George W. Bush wouldn't do it none of them would ever attend any of these big pro-life events
Well, guess what he did
He said give me a year, maybe two we'll turn this whole thing around Alex
And he's about to go on the attack starting in 48 hours
In the first two days he was in office he signed executive orders getting us out of the TPP visited the CIA
Turned the call back on he did hundreds of things in the first two days. What's he gonna do Sunday?
day number one
First year is salvage
next year is
Savage oh
And the savaging is gonna begin and they're racing to kill him right now
Let's let's play a few more minutes of the president where he was invoking life
Humanity having value. We're not trash. We're not ugly. We're not garbage. We're connected to God
We're beautiful creative creatures and when we believe that we then can have that it's not like Oprah Winfrey's secret that you want
A big house or a car you get it
It's the secret of we already have it. Let's go ahead and play it
The president there as he has just wrapped up his remarks at the March for life
Of course
He's speaking from the Rose Garden and he had next to him a woman named Mariana
Denadio who was his example of someone who bravely chose life when she found out that she was 17 years old and pregnant that person now has
six children married and
Helps run an organization called room at the end. The president began his remarks as the first
In his position to ever in all of its years
That's just reality so epic
People over use the word epic, but this is getting epic
The that the it's like we had a hundred and seven fever
We were falling apart a year ago
and now
We're out mowing the yard got a nice tan
Still a lot of bad things going on in the neighborhood
But as a country we're on the mend and it's a dramatic
miraculous recovery and then you look at the nastiness of
The Democrats the nastiness the globalist the the Pope saying open your borders and you know
Oh and attacking Catholics that the criticized pedophilia on the Catholic Church. He came out and said it's not going on leave us alone
Truly evil
And Justin Trudeau
Puts pro-lipers on notice that their views won't be tolerated in public
You're not allowed to put it out on the internet. I'm allowed to demonstrate you have no rights in Canada
Man talk about authoritarianism
That was what Trudeau said yesterday we just print me that and get the video if you can now we've got a blitzkrieg of video coming up and
Just incredible breaking news on so many fronts and what's happened with the FISA
Warrant and and what was filed to get it they say is
Exponentially worse than the memos with the deputy director McCabe saying we we got to set the president up
We can't let him get into office. We got to have an insurance policy
And making stuff up. I mean this is Obama directing
Viciously saying stop him. They're so arrogant. They don't even do it the right way if they were gonna be corrupt
They're just like get him shut him up
Here's the order like yes master. Yeah, I mean it's just incredible and all you Democrats that signed on to this
You don't even get anything out of this. You're just idiots. They'll be back stay with us
Top scientists and researchers agree
We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat sick and

Coming at you live
Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones
Oh, this is the fight
This is how without violence we carry out violence against the liars
scum
The control freaks and their victims think that they're gonna run us over because I feel sorry for the victims of globalism
But a lot of them are dangerous
brainwashed bug-eyed heathen
And I can keep telling them. I don't know how all this is gonna end
But if you want to fight you better believe you got one
And isn't it funny as soon as decent people
Started fighting back across the world evil started falling just like dominoes
Evil always seems unstoppable when it's running wild taking over
Until it runs into real resistance
And then it doesn't ever know what to do
Because it believes its own delusion like CNN and MSNBC and all of them
Can we queue up that clip one more time of Anderson Cooper in the New York Times editor?
Saying I made up the FISA fake warrant and I made up the wiretapping and Comey says I'm crazy
You know says Trump's crazy says everybody's crazy that says it
When it was already on record then
That's like they thought they'd tell you Obamacare was free and then once they got it passed they said oh
It's as cheap as a cable bill
Then they said you can keep your doctor and then they said they never said you can keep your doctors lies lies lies
lies lies lies lies
We're putting the articles on screen for TV viewers you want me to subject the audience the radio audience to come his voice
Let's let's try to grab that because a he said crazy in one and insane in another
The one was a March hearing one was like a little bit later than that
And then I'm gonna just run through these clips I've got to stop pontificating
But former Secret Service agent FISA memo will destroy image of benevolent Obama
Comey to teach ethical leadership course at William and Mary
That's like Jeffrey Dahmer will teach a course on not being a cannibal
Or or I don't know
Just crazy
Chicago man files a pack called I'm gonna assassinate the president Donald J. Trump
California AG says we'll prosecute employers who cooperate with ICE, you know, that's a federal jurisdiction
illegals on the border and
And so then to say if you follow federal law
And don't hire illegals or reporter or whatever we're gonna prosecute you that's called racketeering the very definition
if you
Follow the law
And if you don't commit crimes
Under our little thing here our little
La Cosa Nostra our little thing
Here in California in these cities. We're going to prosecute you
Says the Attorney General
See they passed laws in Illinois in California let illegal aliens vote
But then the AG's would never sign off on it
They would just kind of disappear them or the governor would sign them, but now they're so hyped up and crazy
They're like listen
We're not even going to convict people that shoot women in the back and basically admit they did it
And they've got illegal aliens in these hearings was one this week saying when I get out of here
I'm going to kill more people
And the left's like we're gonna release you because
It's such a in-your-face thing
That the Democrat sheriff got voted out a black sheriff here in Travis County
Just pointing out you know everybody's racist. They was a huge racist
He went to poor average three people a week rapist arsonist murderers
He would give them to ice out of hundreds and hundreds of illegals arrested and they voted him out man
Democrats said no sir, buddy
Illegal who killed cops wishes he'd kill more of the mother efforts. I will break out soon
I will kill more the others video whenever played it. I should have laughing. I'm sorry. I'm digressing
The Attorney General says
You
Stand up to that you report somebody who's illegal even if they just raped your daughter. I'm gonna put you in prison
Whoa
Whoa
You don't use the proper pronoun for someone man or woman you call somebody man or woman and they didn't want to be called
You're going to jail. What this sounds like the Tea Party, you know how Allison Wonderland
But they're not crazy they're overturning everything to create destruction
Here's that clip from CNN though again last March saying that we made up
The illegal spying which is all confirmed in triple kid. Here it is
And so this this bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped which developed on the kind of fringe
right-wing media and then after his tweet storm
Info wars then started saying well look it was the New York Times that reported it citing our story
Misreading our story and now a few weeks later the White House and the president are citing
Info wars so they've got one kind of bizarre right wing friends theory to defend another bizarre right wing friends theory
Both of which there's no evidence to support and just to be clear here. There is and correct me if I'm wrong
There's absolutely nothing whatsoever in your reporting in the New York Times that indicates President Obama
Wiretapped or ordered wiretapping of then candidate Trump correct nothing. I mean if we knew that that is a fantastic story. I
Mean those guys look like
They'd kill you for a stick of bubblegum. I mean they look disingenuous
But of course there also are disingenuous and make fat liars. Just look at these two
Think they're in love with themselves
So here is
Congressman Gates and others are saying that have seen the FISA document. It is
Something they say is so criminal so over the top that these people are all gonna go to jail
If the Attorney General does his job here it is. I think that this will not end just with firings
I believe there are people who will go to jail
I was very persuaded by the evidence and it also became clear to me why Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham
Felt it so important to refer this matter for criminal prosecution
You don't get to try to undermine our country undermine our elections and then simply get fired
So I think there will be criminal implications here
And we have to underscore the point that you and Jim Jordan just made every single Democrat on the Intelligence Committee
Voted against even allowing other members of Congress to see this information
So you know they're gonna fight against release to the American people. What are the Democrats so afraid of?
Why don't they want the American people to know the truth about what was going on with the government how that impacted the president?
His transition his campaign and it just seems interesting to me that Democrats don't want us to know what the entire
Basis was in the first place for the Mueller probe
They want to you drag this out through the midterm elections to try to embarrass this president and distract this Congress from the critical
Work we've got to do to save this great country
Let's release the documents and the full clips are up on info wars.com of Gates of Jim Jordan
Going over it all
It's classified so they can't release it yet the Democrats fought they had the Democrat cabal inside the FBI
Democrat cabal inside the Justice Department directed by Hillary and Obama
We had that map last week. We were kept showing her this week
I mean it shows like the crime chart and it's all confirmed now
Right down to the American people right to the FISA court right to the whole system and
So just like they had that compartmentalized in Congress the Democrats are like no no no don't don't look at the warrant
Because it's got El Presidente's fingerprints on it now. There's the map. So you've got Lynch and
combing under Obama and
Then you've got Sally Yates and you've got Andrew McCabe
and you've got or and Carlin and Lisa Page and Peter Strock and Baker and
Prystap and then fusion GPS and the Russian dossier they pay for it
They create it the group of their underlings do it they get paid government money to create the fabrication
the fraud and
Then they shovel it out through the media and now the Democrats in Congress like Peter ship and the rest of them fight
Like drowning rats
Scrabbling scrabbling as the water rises and attempt to get out there be rat eyes
Rubbing the rat like hands together
What are we gonna do politically is the water of truth rises
Hear that
That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place
And what they don't steal will be destroyed this year

So we talk a lot about how there's parallel universes and the globalist controlled media
Claims that
We are living in some fake echo chamber libertarians conservatives nationalists common-sense people and they're living in the real world
Well, really this fies a document and the fact that Congress has it and the fact that Obama did order the illegal spying with false info on Trump
has been out now
For a couple days and there's been almost no news coverage of it
except on places like drudge report comm and info wars comm and
Newsweek is saying that it's a conspiracy theory still
That none of this existed nobody ever spied on the president or anybody else
Even when it's now admitted in congressional testimony and Comey's been caught perjuring himself. It just gets crazier and crazier
And now we've got Hannity coming out saying, you know disband the russia gate. It's a total fraud
Then they spent it oh, you're scared of it
No, it's a total fraud created by Democrat Party holdovers
Inside the Justice Department. We now understand it's a total fraud. There's nothing to fear, but I'll tell you this I
Say leave it there. It's so embarrassing to the establishment, but
President Trump reportedly is agreeing to meet with Mueller
I'm sure the president knows what he's doing
But he better record it because Mueller will come out and tell a lie just like Comey did because Mueller is involved with the
Communist Chinese the Russians he has been waivers from the Justice Department to do so. These are the bad actors
They're really bad people
This is a very very critical time to be alive right now. Let's play a clip of Hannity talking about this
Now at the end of all of this
We're gonna learn an awful lot beyond any shadow of a doubt that the special counsel Robert Mueller and his band of
Democratic witch hunters never should have been appointed and they need to be disbanded immediately
And here's why struck and page are connected to everything. What we're learning tonight is that these two trumpeting individuals?
They're at the heart and soul and center of it all. I'll stop right there
They'll have ninety six hundred texts. Let's put that map back up if we can of the different players
Hannity, I'm not criticizing Hannity because he's got more courage anybody else on mainstream television
But this is still watered down
Most of these people are involved with the Russians and the Chinese and covering up previous Clinton crimes
So they're not just creating a fraud to derail the election of a patriotic
Great president
They're not just witch hunters. They're not just haters they organized criminal activity to defraud the American voter of this recovery
So it's much much worse than what Hannity saying the Russian investigation has been dead for months
It's like shooting an old dead horse 50 more times. It's still it's still a dead horse
The issue is what are these people gonna dig up next and are we gonna sit there and put up with them? I?
Know Hannity doesn't want to sound too extreme, but they are extreme
Obama ran this whole thing. He needs to go to prison
These people aren't above the law. These aren't Americans. These are globalists. Oh
It'll cause a civil war. They're already trying to cause one
Justice be done by the heavens fall. We have to attack them legally and lawfully. We have to go after Soros
We have to defeat them all they're not going to stop
Like World War two you don't just kick Hitler back into Germany. He's gonna reconstitute attack again
You don't just kick the Japanese out of the Pacific Islands you got to go all the way to Tokyo
They started it
You think I want to keep going up against these people when they're after me no
But whatever has to happen is gonna happen. We're going all the way against these people period. We have to do it
There's no other choice
They've all got a politically
hang
for their crimes
And incidentally
You
Know what the punishment for treason is
These are the foreign individuals that took our country over
They're the ones that corrupted everything almost the point of the country's death and they're still trying to strangle the country today
We must stand against them
All right moving along
Just looking into an area of total fraud
Total disingenuousness total upside-down world is bono of
You too that I guess might have been cool 30 years ago
That is the
Propaganda arm of the UN the globalist every pump and up scheme every scam to go have African aid and then you learn that Bono's
Charity gives less than 1% and under pressure. He gives 1.2%
Bono's one foundation
Gives under 1% under fire. Go read it for yourself daily mail. You name it
He's worse than the Clintons they gave like two and a half percent to Haiti and stole all the rest
Doesn't matter though
He can virtue signal and have a big music video showing dead kids washing up on the shore
It's our fault Muslims are killing each other and showing the KKK
Marching
This guy's so dialed into everything on Spotify or on your car or you have to go in and program it not to force feed you
Bono songs
You look at up the news they default force feed you him I mean they are the biggest
Globalist whores on the planet and
And they're the ones
Robbing the world and then having graphics of mall off cocktails
Telling you to go out and burn down
Cracker land fight back with a mall off cocktail and
Stop being a slave of the system
That's right. Don't get the tax cuts. Don't don't don't get the health care
Don't don't get a stabilized economy. Don't get a world built for people that believes in people. No
And then a bunch of iconography about death oh, but then showing you a bunch of children the world all living together, but under who
Under who who's gonna run the big world government who's gonna control the big world government who's gonna direct it
Oh, it's a secret TPP. It's it's a secret directorate. You can't even know what it is kind of like
Oh, Congress came and see the FISA warrant against Trump because it's the fusing GPS and was directed by
Obama we know Susan Rice and all them that were unmasking
Privately going into everybody's data their phones their emails. They were just sitting in the White House peering over
Ivanka Trump and
peering over Melania Trump and
Pouring over Don, Jr. And Donald Trump and Donald Trump, Jr
Just in there
beavering away and
Then leaking stuff to the press but 90% false but enough truth in it
To make it believable in something beyond the East German stausee could ever have imagined and
Then they still have the New York Times and
CNN saying none of it's true none of it's true as they have hearings and admit it's all true as
They hang on by their fingernails
But the wind gets stronger stronger and now they're hanging on by one hand and they're never gonna hang on even if they kill the president
They're done
The globalists are done this current crop of criminals screwed the pooch. You have been defeated
You have been defeated. It's a no-brainer a big Berkey water filter is the one you need period
You need a water filter that removes chlorine fluoride

That's infowarslife.com.
I want to plow into all of this.
But I'm going to spend a few minutes here first,
just encouraging listeners to understand
that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems,
or books, or videos, or other material from infowarstore.com,
you are funding the revolution.
I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
And so it is essential that you purchase the products
at infowarstore.com.
I don't want to thank everybody that has,
but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
You cannot beat that for children and adults.
We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
infowarslife.com, or triple-A-253-3139.
And your purchase of the products stands with us,
stands with America, stands with Trump,
stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
And that's who they are.
And they know we know who they are.
And they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
And we are back live.
You know, Bono and you too have a lot of nerve putting on a new music video
saying that the president is a KKK member
and that members of the staff at home
go home at night to their families
and hang up their KKK robes.
It's simply incredible because there's no proof,
there's no truth to it.
But on top of that, it's defamation and slander
to attempt to create race war that we know is in the WikiLeaks
where the Democrats talk about creating culture war
and race war as a way to maintain control.
But the biggest issue is the Daily Mail and others report
that you too is on record and Bono keeping 99% or more
of the money from mainly African charities they run.
So they have these big music telethons,
broadcasts worldwide, sometimes they raise over a billion dollars.
They keep 99% personally.
Bono's one foundation under fire for giving little over 1%.
First it was 0.8, now they give 1.2.
Think about what a monster he is, but lowest black unemployment
ever recorded, Trump targeting abortion,
which targets mainly blacks, 52% being aborted,
Trump trying to move the factories back
into the African-American areas.
All that's the proof.
Doesn't matter, Bono says he's KKK.
Think about how that's a perfect cover
for what he is really up to.
Now, Joining Us is an amazing lady with billions of views
of her videos and articles just on Facebook and Twitter alone.
Most of you know who she is.
I've followed her for years.
And she's able to mobilize conservatives, libertarians,
Christians, just people that are common sense, activist mommy,
to be able to go look at what's happening in the schools
where they're teaching children masturbation,
where children's magazines are teaching little girls about anal sex
so that they depopulate just all sorts of incredible things.
The latest thing is the promotion of sex toys
to little girls and also prosthetic penises
so that they can learn to be transgender,
even Camille Pagley, who's more of a liberal lesbian,
says this is child abuse.
Meanwhile, no leftist criticism of Turkish state
moving to legalize marrying girls age nine,
Netflix hosting shows,
about sex with children and how great it is,
Salon pushing it.
They're not getting banned from Twitter.
She has been banned from Twitter.
And we've been contacted by Twitter and they said,
if you use the T word,
must use transgender,
if you use the name that that community created themselves,
you will be banned.
And I said to the guys,
we documented it all, took the phone calls, recorded it,
told them we were.
I said, let's watch the process of this.
When there's new words,
they've called, there's new words.
So what it is is just training.
And pretty soon,
they'll tell you what you got to do when you're gone.
But we're making a documentary out of it.
Let Twitter know that we've infiltrated them,
as you know, in Project Veritas as well,
where they go, oh, we do what the Communist Chinese tell us
and what the Democrats tell us.
And we record women naked and we save it on our computers.
Ha, ha, ha.
It's all very, very funny to them.
And they're the new ruling class.
They're the technocrats.
So, put into abstention, put into the memory hole.
And people say, well, that's their own platform.
But they're discriminatory.
You have the left, Suzy,
if you don't bake a gay couple's cake.
I mean, I do it, because I just think it's free market.
But the point is, if you want to, it should be your right.
Oh, that's a multi-hundred thousand dollar fine.
But if you want to say you're a Christian
and teaching five-year-old girls how to have anal sex is wrong,
you're banned.
So the activist mommy, Elizabeth Johnston, joins us.
Was it Twitter, activist mommy, one, Facebook,
the activist mommy, Instagram, the activist mommy official,
YouTube, the activist mommy.
And it's smart to have lots of platforms like she does.
This is like whack-a-mole as they try to ban you.
So, so much to get into, so much to talk about.
I don't know if you saw Trump about an hour ago
giving the first ever Republican speech
to the right to life march.
This is a pretty seismic deal.
And I, they don't know what to do about Trump
because it seems like he's breaking their will
and giving everybody else the courage
to stand against this cultural jihad
to shut down free speech that the left's been on.
So thanks for joining us.
Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me on.
That is good to have you.
Where do you want to start?
I mean, the censorship, the latest sexualization of children.
What's going on?
Oh, you tell me.
I am banned for four days.
I did not use the team.
You know, we're going to do something here.
I know you do big videos and big shows all the time.
That's probably on our end,
but we're going to get your phone number.
It's great to be able to see you on Skype.
We're going to call you right back on backup
and get you on that way because we're going to check
our Skype system here or whatever.
It's been having some issues.
Seems to have to be better in that studio,
but maybe it's just me.
Maybe I'm wrong.
We're going to figure that out
and see if we can get her on air with us.
But I mean, just think about this.
I really just wanted to have her on
because I don't want her on.
Because she's someone who's been put into a memory hole.
She's someone who's been shot off into space.
And you know info wars is next.
You know Paul Watson's next.
And we've got video of them saying,
hey, we're censoring Jones on YouTube.
We don't want people to share the videos.
You just got to go to his Alex Jones channel to find them.
And if we see something trending, we block it
because they know there's major lawsuit liability for them.
So they had to act like they're still allowing us to be there.
And they have the congressional hearings with the Twitter,
Facebook and Google executives where they're sitting there
in everyone's face.
But there's one way you can stop them.
And that is to continue to support us on AM and FM stations,
local TV stations more and more picking us up.
That's our big push this year.
We're getting some new satellites.
We'll announce the next month.
And just as important as that,
it's critical for you to financially support us.
We've got some huge specials running right now.
They're going to have to end very, very soon.
So we are selling out of survival shield X2,
the good halogen with the true atomic nation iodine
and secret 12.
That's the info wars life core combo pack.

They're all talking about secret 12.
People say, why does pure B12 taste so good?
It's like a precursor to your whole body.
You got to have it.
X2 is just incredible.
I take it in water and take it right under the tongue.
And again, if you want to do something for yourself,
more vitamin C and more high quality iodine.
You die without both of these.
And a vitamin C is plentiful.
Iodine is just one of the things that people are so deficient in
and not the bound to iodine, the sodium iodine,
the other garbage out there, but the real iodine.
We've got true atomic pure iodine.
Available at infowarsstore.com or triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
Oh, and we have the new pollen block that folks are really loving.

A new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients.
But it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
And I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers.
Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have
to even make the hormones in your glands.
It is amazing.

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
Live from the Infoworks.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
Look at this report from LifeSite.
Facebook says group wanting to burn alive Christian mom meets community standards,
but she's banned from Twitter.
So we're going to talk to a lady who's reached billions of people
and who they're targeting and who's been banned from Twitter.
The activist mommy, Elizabeth Johnston.
So, Elizabeth, let's get into why you're so hated, why you're so feared,
and why they're trying to ban you.
Hi, Alex. I'm so sorry about the technical problems we've had.
Look, you know, I don't toe the line,
and I am pushing back against some of their pet agendas.
I push back against the feminazis and the LGBT agenda
and the slaughtering of children through abortion,
brainwashing our children to think Islam is a religion of peace.
These are the things that I address on my platform through articles
and videos that I create.
And, you know, I am being censored frequently.
Last year was banned from Facebook for first three days
and then seven days for clothing,
just simply what the Bible says about homosexuality.
That was a worldwide story that hit Fox and Friends
and George Report and The New York Times and, of course, Facebook apologized
and said that it was an error once the story had gotten to be so big
that it was a PR nightmare for them and they restored, you know, my account.
My account, back to me.
And right now there's a story going that there's a group on Facebook
called I Will Find Activist Mommy and Burn Whoever Runs It Alive.
And people, hundreds, thousands of people have reported it.
And Facebook said that that death threat does not go against their community standards
and they're not going to remove the group from Facebook.
It's amazing and the same stuff happens to me.
It happens to Trump.
It happens to everybody who's prominently just promoting traditionalist values
that are not being tolerated, that are under siege.
And I noticed they let transgenders use the other T-word that we can't use or were banned.
So it's also very discriminatory that that terms in newspapers.
And I was reading, it says, Wikipedia says,
Twitter decided in 2017 that it was a hate word,
even though it's a word that comes from that very group.
So even if we buckle under and only use words they use,
they'll then tell us that we can't use a word, but they can.
This is true authoritarianism.
It is George Orwell's 1984 for sure.
The thing is though, Alex, I don't use that term.
And that's not why I'm banned from Twitter.
The reason Twitter banned me is because I said that a transgender teenager
who committed suicide, poor child committed suicide,
claimed it was because the high school that he attended
did not allow him to change his sex, his name until he was 16.
That was the policy of the school.
And supposedly that was the reason that this boy was so unhappy and committed suicide.
I made a comment on Twitter with this article four months ago, Alex.
Four months ago they just found this and decided to make an issue of it.
I made the comment that the LGBT community is responsible
and is harming transgender teenagers by not getting them
the psychological and emotional help and counseling that they need.
40% of transgenders attempt to commit suicide
versus 4% of the non-transgender of the general population.
And it clearly transgenders need to get psychological and emotional counseling.
And it's not being offered to them because the LGBT community
is enabling these young people and it's making them feel that they are entitled
to their sex changes and their game changes.
I made that type of comment and now I am banned from Twitter for seven days.
They are in essence putting me through sensitivity training right now.
Wow. And expanding on that, the gay community, which I don't hate anybody,
on average, diverse group of people, but on average they have the highest level
of suicide globally of any group.
And it's not because folks are being mean to them, it's because that community is being mean to them.
I've seen the studies, I've witnessed it for myself.
I've had friends, family, neighbors that are gay, you go to their party,
they're being meaner than hell to each other.
A lot of gay people are really mean.
And let's not lie about that and let's not lie about how they treat each other
and that lesbians have the highest level of abusing each other.
And I don't hate women that like women.
The whole point is they don't want to discuss why they have the highest rates
of drug use suicide.
And then in that group, the transgenders are even bigger
and I'm going into four and five-year-olds in England telling them
you may be something else and then having major mental illness problems.
Well, of course, they are sexualizing children.
It's a giant experiment.
It's being run by the Tavistock Institute and of course it's creating big problems.
And you point out, as Camille Paglia does, who's a liberal and a professor,
that this is abuse.
It's abuse when you go to anybody and start sexualizing them at age five, six, seven, eight.
Go ahead.
Yeah, one of the things, Alex, one of the things that really has drawn a lot of attention
to my platform, I don't know if you heard about it last year,
is that I burned a Teen Vogue magazine when Teen Vogue was teaching teenagers,
kids, how to stautomize one another.
Oh yeah, tell folks about that.
Yeah, they printed a tutorial online of how to have anal sex.
And I was livid, as were millions of parents.
And so I filmed a quick two-minute video, burned a Teen Vogue magazine,
called it smut and called upon the public to go to their stores and their libraries
and make sure that Teen Vogue was not being carried,
that it was being pulled from the shelves.
We started hashtag Operation Pull Teen Vogue.
And as you probably know, we gave Teen Vogue such a black eye that they have not recovered from it.
And they actually had to shutter their print edition.
December was their last print edition because we have really done such damage to their reputation.
And by the way, I mean, I totally agree and you've done a great job.
That's why they fear you.
Look at how the Metro, the biggest paper in London, printed cartoons of children having sex
and told parents to sexualize their children.
We've got countless examples of this in the news, in the TV shows, on Netflix.
This is clearly, in my view, a mainlining of pedophilic culture.
What do you think?
Oh, absolutely.
I'm sure you're familiar with the book written in, I believe, 1958 called the Naked Communist.
Yes.
They lay out goals of the Communist Party USA and one of their goals, number 40, is discredit
the family as an institution, encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.
Goal number 25 is break down culture standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity
in books, magazines, and motion pictures, radio, and TV.
Our local law enforcement are cowards, straight up cowards, because they will not enforce
the good and decent obscenity laws that are on our books nationwide.
Every state, every city has great obscenity laws, but no one is enforcing them.
This has to stop.
Now we have pornographic, graphic interbending sex ed in our elementary schools and middle
schools and high schools.
That's why we started something called sex ed sit out, and I want to ask all of your
listeners please to go to Facebook right now.
A bunch of us moms have started a movement called sex ed sit out, and on April 23rd,
we are going to pull our children out of the public schools in protest of the pornographic
sex ed in the schools.
Please go to Facebook search bar at the top and type in sex ed sit out and like our page
and get involved in our movement.
Well please come back on for that as soon as we get our Skype fix for yours or whatever
it is or phone, because absolutely we see this big push back against this all over the
world, and they always said oh you're just ignorant, you're like Amish or something, you
don't want people knowing about their body parts, give me a break.
They are sexualizing, they are trying to teach young people deviant fetish behavior, because
the left has fetishized sexualizing children, even salon, even the New York Times are promoting
pedophilia.
That is the bottom of the rabbit hole.

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Coming to you from the former United States of America.
From deep in the heart of Texas.
It's Alex Jones.
That's right. We've been under globalism.
Our country was under TPP.
Really was lost at sovereignty.
Trump's turning that around.
Pretty soon we'll have to not play those liners anymore
because they won't be able to play those liners anymore.
But we're in the middle of a civil war right now.
What an amazing lady.
Dariah, one of our producers said,
why don't you get an activist mommy on.
I've been watching her for years.
That lady's really on point.
She leads all these major attacks.
And they're wanting her dead now.
I said absolutely.
So I want to get her on anytime she wants to come on.
Just an amazing individual.
And I wanted to ask her in this short segment before Peter Schiff
joins us on The Economy and for Roger Stonebreak's major news
on what's going on behind the scenes with FISA
and how Obama was behind that.
He broke that in April of last year.
So next year's news today, that's coming up.
But I wanted to get activist mommy Elizabeth Johnson
to talk more about where she sees the battle now.
And again, we're not flogging it.
The sleeping majority of everybody out there,
every race, color and creed that loves just being decent
and trying to not be overtaken by the leftist agenda.
We have to get aggressive.
We have to get out in the field.
We have to take action.
So where are we right now at this juncture, this fight,
and you're really the expert in battled frontline view?
And what can people do in the culture war?
Well, Alex, as you were saying, the radical left
has waged war against the natural family.
You know, father and mother and child,
and has waged war against really all things decent.
And we must wake up as a culture, as parents,
and push back against this indoctrination.
You know, one person burned a team of magazine
and look at the shock waves, look at what happened.
One person pushing back in your sphere of influence,
whether it's going to your city council meeting and saying,
no, we're not going to have men in the girls locker room.
Whatever God is calling you to do,
answer the voice and the passion that he's given you,
and answer that call and push back against this attack
on the family, the attack on decency,
the attack on everything that's made America good,
and let's work together to make America great again.
I mean, ultimately, you know, this is a spiritual problem
that we have in this nation.
We need to return to our Creator.
We need to turn from our sin and our selfishness.
And we need to get back to the way the founding fathers
believed our nation should be run as one nation under God.
You're right.
And again, they use our strength against us
that America is open, Christianity is tolerant.
And then they've gone from tolerance to now.
We have to adopt all the things that the left's doing,
including hundreds of new bizarre fetishes
that are even being taught in school,
like being married to a car, having sex with a car,
burning your eyeballs out with Drano,
and then the government pays for you to be blind
or paying to have sex changes.
I mean, I don't pay for people's nose jobs.
How did we ever get in this position
of just these people dictating everything to us?
And not even the average leftist,
but these would be cultural kings.
Oh, yeah, you're so right.
I mean, Alex, facts and science and truth matter.
And because I say two plus one equals five doesn't mean,
it doesn't make it true.
And this trendy new phrase that people want to say,
gender is binary and it's on a spectrum.
No, no, biologically, scientifically,
we are XX or XY,
or we have a disorder.
We have an abnormality, either a biological
or a psychological abnormality,
and we need treatment.
Look, what I say, Alex, is we just need some straight talk
from American citizens and from the mom and dad
to the world, and that's why people follow me,
is I just shoot straight.
This is stupid. This gender insanity job
is one of the stupidest moments.
As you know, they're firing professors that just point out
men and women in the whole mammal species
have these chromosomes. It's crazy.
Activists, mommy, please join us again very soon.
God bless you and good luck with all your work
and thank God for our great president today
with what we saw at that pro-life march.
We'll be right back.

Roger Stone's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
He was the first to report on Obama using Fusion GPS
to basically illegally fraudulently get warrants
against candidate Trump, nominee Trump,
President-elect Trump,
and then I guess ongoing when he was a president,
Trump knew about it as the president.
He said it's classified, I can't tell you,
they've spied on me.
And we broke all that news last year,
seeing it in a tactics, you name it, said it wasn't true.
And now members of Congress that have seen the memo
say it's Obama directly ordering it.
And just like in the other memos,
they say we've got to stop Trump.
They admit it's a fraud.
It's the arrogance of narcissistic criminals
that always brings them down.
Their boldness is something that makes them successful.
And the fact that they leave a trail of destruction behind them
and ruin every business they're in or family, they don't care,
because they're just onto the next scam.
So we're dealing with narcissists, sociopaths,
and psychopaths, and then mercenaries that'll work for them.
And they just ruin civilization.
So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
Peter Schiff of EuroPak.com, American businessman,
investor, broker, billions under management.
I'm not going to get into this by everybody knows him,
best-selling author, run for Senate, things like that.
It was Ron Paul's chief economic advisor,
always liked getting him on.
I wanted to get him on about the fact that I predicted
that if Trump got in, we'd see the economy explode.
Because I mean, I knew we had artificial globalist policies
in place suppressing our economy.
And I know the whole world's a bubble and all the rest of it,
but if you remove the rope tied around us at the dock on the boat,
it's going to start running out there into the ocean.
Now, I know that China's a big bubble and we're a big bubble,
but I got to tell you, we've had some debates here with Mr. Schiff,
who's also believed that there was some chances of big growth.
And then we've had some other folks who didn't think that,
thought there's no way because of demographic cliffs.
And I get demographic cliffs,
but if you've got things artificially suppressed here,
and then built up there, then if Trump comes in and removes
a bunch of regulations and taxes,
won't that at least in the interim boost things?
I think you're seeing that.
Krugman said it would never get above 3%.
It's a 3.3.
You see Trump giving his number one award to the New York Times
for betting against America.
So I agree the fundamentals are crazy.
I'm not an economist.
I just study this stuff.
And at the same time, aren't you glad things haven't blown up yet?
The question is, will they?
What's going to happen?
And then what's happening with cryptocurrencies,
seeming like that bubble is starting to bust
as regulators start to go after them.
So we'll find out about this and a lot more
from Peter Schiff at EuroPak.com.
Peter, good to have you back with us.
Thanks for having me on.
And happy New Year to you and your audience.
And I agree with you.
The economy is going to blow up,
but it's going to blow up like a bomb.
It's not a good thing.
It's a bad thing.
Unfortunately, that's what Trump has inherited from Obama.
But it's not even really just Obama.
It's the Federal Reserve.
It's the monetary policy that has been passed like a baton
from Clinton to Bush to Obama and now to Trump.
And we're near the end of the game.
And unfortunately, Trump's going to be the fall guy.
This thing is all going to collapse while he's president.
And he owns the stock market bubble.
He and the Republicans own the economy now
thanks to these tax cuts.
They're not going to make any difference,
but they are going to give the Democrats a reason
to blame it all on Trump and the Republicans.
But we are getting closer to this collapse.
You mentioned GDP growth.
Last year, the economy, the way they measure at GDP,
will probably end up being a little bit above
two and a half percent for the year,
which is about the same as we were getting.
A little bit better maybe than the average
of the last four years under Obama.
But there were years that Obama had higher than that.
But the important thing is if you look at what's happening
in the dollar, for example, last year was the first year
in five years that the dollar went down
and it was the biggest decline in 14 years.
We had the biggest drop against the Chinese yuan in nine years.
And in fact, I think this year we're going to fall
to an all-time record low against the yuan.
I think we're going to hit record lows
against other major currencies like the euro
and the yen maybe by 2019 or 2020.
Look at the bond market.
We're at about a four-year high now in ten-year treasuries.
But bond prices are rising.
Look at oil.
Oil is now back at $63, $64 a barrel.
We've had a huge increase, but we're just getting started.
Gold is on the verge of breaking out.
It hasn't really done it yet.
We're still trading around $1340.
But what's happening is inflation is rearing its ugly head
in a big way.
And this is going to help push up interest rates.
And what Trump has done, or what the Republicans
have done with these tax cuts,
they're not going to help the economy
because the economy has so many other headwinds
that are going to hit it.
But they are going to push up the deficit.
The budget deficits are going to soar.
The trade deficits are at record highs.
They're going to soar.
These rising twin deficits, increasing interest rates,
is reminiscent of 1987 before the market crash.
But the problem is we are more dependent now
than we ever have been.
The Federal Reserve made the mistake
of a huge bubble economy that completely depends
on extremely low interest rates to survive.
Peter, let's come back to that in a moment.
Let's come back to the moment.
I agree with you on the fundamentals.
And you predicted a lot of things accurately before.
But this is what I'm getting at.
What was Trump supposed to do when they already had it planned
to go down, admittedly, when Hillary got in
and kind of organized our collapse
and used that for social control?
What is Trump supposed to do when he's trying
to end globalist control, NTPP, stabilize the border,
get people believing in humanity again,
doing a lot of really good positive things
to return sovereignty?
He is using a bubble against their bubble.
And I see a lot of these policies actually deploying
money back to the people, the average family, $13,000.
Alex, this is going to backfire.
He's like the Jimmy Carter in reverse.
I think we're going to have an extremely liberal president,
either a Bernie Sanders or someone like him in 2020.
What Trump should have done is leveled with the American people.
Like he kind of did when he was a candidate.
He talked about how bad things were,
but he didn't really say what needed to be done to fix it.
But at least he said, we have a bubble in the stock market.
The economy is a mess.
I mean, all that was true, and that's why he got elected.
But after he got elected, he became a cheerleader
for the very economy that he correctly criticized.
And now he has set everybody up.
He has raised everybody's expectations so high
that when everything comes crashing down,
not only will he get blamed,
but everyone's going to be disappointed.
What he should have done, the moment he was sworn in,
is he should have leveled with everybody and said,
you know what, this is a disaster.
It is a mess.
I am going to fix this, but it's not going to be fun.
The medicine that we're going to swallow right now
is not going to taste good.
But here's the problem.
He knows the people were already demoralized
by the globalist, by Obama, and all this other crud.
And you know, you're saying, oh, the economy's not really
growing any faster than on Obama.
Well, it does show 3.3%.
And everybody I know is seeing a difference,
record low, black unemployment.
I mean, I think exuberance can bring us out of this
and break the back of the globalist
and show that they were the ones suppressing things,
and then we can reorganize things.
I agree you're absolutely right about the Federal Reserve
and all of it.
But man, if he came in here and tanked the stock market
with a reset like you're talking about,
they'd really be able to impeach his butt.
No, he campaigned and said it was a bubble.
It wasn't his bubble.
Now it's his bubble.
That's the problem.
But if he would have said it's a bubble and it's going down,
it wouldn't have been his fault.
Because part of the cure for the economy
is deflating these bubbles.
It has to be done.
Someone has to rip this Band-Aid off.
And he was elected to do it.
Well, isn't he doing that?
Isn't he doing that, getting rid of the right-off
for state income tax and for property tax?
No, he's not coming close to doing that.
These are gimmicking tax cuts that run up the deficit.
They are not real tax cuts because we're not having cuts
in government spending.
You said we have record low black unemployment.
Black unemployment was falling under Obama too
because blacks were leaving the labor force.
And that hasn't changed.
You have record low labor force participation rate.
Hardly any blacks are working.
I mean, percentage-wise.
So that's why they're not unemployed.
Look how many are in prison.
So this is not some kind of...
Now wait a minute.
Black unemployment almost doubled under Obama.
No, the unemployment rate doubled for everybody
at the beginning because, you know,
and then it all started to come down.
But the reason it came down was because
so many people left the labor force
and so many people accepted crappy, low-paying,
part-time jobs.
And that is what's going on.
That hasn't changed under Trump.
All right.
Well, listen, anybody who accuses me of being
as a cheerleader for the economy,
this is the balancing of it out.
I hope Peter Schiff's wrong.
You're a smart guy.
What's going to happen then?
How will the implosion look?
I mean, let's war game that.
We'll come back.

Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
He's basically up here saying that there's a giant bubble.
Well, you just heard him earlier if you were tuned in,
that Trump's helped pump it up now
and that he's going to be the fall guy
when it implodes discrediting capitalism
and bringing in basically a communist.
Is that what you're getting at, Mr. Schiff?
A, and then B,
how will the bubble go down in different scenarios
and how far will the market go down
if your scenario's right?
Because I'll be honest with you,
it gets a little scary when the market's getting
and that does kind of get me a little concerned.
Yeah, you know, this is the same thing
that happened under George W. Bush, right?
He inherited a bubble.
Instead of leveling with the American public,
he pretended everything was great
and then the bigger bubble that was inflated
while he was president collapsed
except that he got a second term
because his bubble didn't really pop
until the end of his second term.
I think Trump's is going to pop during his first term
because this one is much bigger
and we don't have as much time.
Here's how it's going to go down.
So what's going to happen is
interest rates are going to keep rising,
commodity prices are going to keep rising,
the dollar's going to keep falling,
so you're going to start to see pickups
in the official inflation rate
and so rising consumer prices
and rising interest rates are going to start
to be a powerful headwind
for the economy because Americans
are going to be spending a lot more money
on basic necessities,
if they have an adjustment rate mortgage,
credit card debt, auto loan,
all this cheap money is going to be gradually going away
and the economy is going to be weakening
and as the economy is weakening,
unemployment is going to start to pick up.
Now, the Fed's going to see this.
The Fed's going to see the economy slowing down
and if they continue to raise rates,
it will go into recession.
Now, that is better than the alternative
but the alternative, if the Federal Reserve
decides that they want
to prevent a recession
or maybe fight off a recession
and they don't recognize it in time,
if they want to prop up the stock market
then what they have to do
is call off the rate hikes.
In fact, I think they have to go back to zero.
They have to launch QE4
in order to keep interest rates from really spiking
and to prop up the market
but that will set off a currency crisis.
The dollar will plunge, not just make new lows
but destroy the old lows
and that will set off an economic crisis
that's far worse than the financial crisis
or the recession.
They say China
some numbers five, six, seven, eight times
the amount of state-sponsored pumping money into it.
They execute you.
If you criticize the markets over there
China is going to lower their taxes
to basically zero to incentivize companies to stay.
How can China's bubble just continue
to go up and up and up and up and up
when they've got all their problems
and then you're saying that our bubble
isn't going to work.
I really hope you're wrong because
they've got news articles out there
where they call the stock market
and say, wow, why'd the market jump?
Well, Jones came out and said coming admitted
Trump not under criminal investigation.
Well, he really did say that.
I know this show actually affects markets
and I get it's all a house of cards
but good lord, man.
If they've got house of cards that are much, much bigger
and out of control over in China
I don't like trying
to pull the house of cards down.
Well, remember, China now has
record trade surpluses.
The Chinese people save 30%
of what they earn. We barely
save 3% our savings rates at a 10 year low.
The Chinese government
doesn't really, isn't in debt. They have assets.
They got trillions and trillions of dollars
of assets. We have liability.
They're the biggest owners of our debt, aren't they?
They own our debt, but they own other
debt, but they don't have
Social Security, they don't have Medicare,
they don't have all these unfunded liabilities
the way we do.
Chinese rely on themselves.
Americans rely on the government.
We have got a much bigger bubble.
They actually have a vibrant economy.
Yes, there are problems in that economy
but a lot of it has to do
with their misguided efforts to prop up the
dollar so they can keep selling
Americans products that we can't afford
and that will never pay for.
By the way, Peter, I'm not
being critical of this. I think investors
should invest wherever they like. I know you're
Euro-Pacific capital. I know you're all about
investing all over the world, but are you
going to turn because you've got more foreign investments?
I am, and actually
a lot of our strategies
have beaten the U.S. market over the last
two years despite the fact that it's gone up
and we're beating it again in a lot of strategies
this year because the dollar is so weak
that gives you a huge
tailwind when now you're investing internationally.
So for all the years the dollar
was strengthening,
that was eating away at international
returns, but the dollar is about
to lose all of that strength and then some.
So now, if you're bullish
on the stock market, there's no reason to be
invested in the U.S. market, we're going to make
so much more money and we are making much more
money in emerging markets,
in commodity. But in your modeling,
lower dollar brings back more manufacturing
jobs. No, it doesn't.
The lower dollar is going to bring record high
trade deficits because it's going to increase
what we have to pay to import the things that we
have to do. Peter, I've got to say though, man,
I think betting against America, I just
have a gut feeling that
the best laid plans of mice and men
often go astray.
I'm not betting against America, I'm betting against
the socialists and the central bankers who
would destroy America. In the long run,
maybe America is going to come back,
but first we're going to have to pay the piper.
This is a gigantic bubble, Trump was right
when he was a candidate, the air is coming out.
No, I know, Trump sounded like he was a candidate
and then they got mad at him saying,
you know, the real estate's too high,
all this stuff hurts average families, you're right.
But I'm just saying, being right
actually is good.
But I mean, you're a successful wealthy
guy, the average family and hard
working people that are working two, three jobs
collapse is going to, at least in the short
term, hurt them bad.
But it's going to happen now anyway, it's going to happen worse
when the dollar collapses, it wipes out the middle
class, people are going to be impoverished
and they're going to blame Trump.
You know, there are a lot of people who voted for
Trump out of frustration, he promised a lot,
he talked big, he is not going
to deliver and that is going to be used against
him and it's going to ultimately be
used against the country.
Way to see how bad things get, you know, these tax cuts
they're all temporary, they're all going
away in 2021.
What do you think the Democrats are going to do
when they have the White House and both houses
of Congress? How high do you think they're going
to jack taxes up on corporations?
What do you think they're going to do to
entrepreneurs? This is a disaster.
We had a chance to diffuse this if
Trump would have owned up to the problems
of the economy, they weren't his fault,
they were all on his predecessor and
he could have finally put politics
aside and done the right thing
for this country. Instead,
he acted just like all the other presidents
who have just, you know, continued to kick
the can down the road. Well, I don't think he
acted like all of them on social issues
like marching with pro-life, nobody's
done that, the border,
the veterans, I mean, he's really
delivering a lot of fronts. No, no, I'm
talking about big cuts to government spending,
dealing with entitlements, getting
cutting Social Security and Medicare so we don't
have math. No, no, I agree, that's got to start.
There's been some cutting. No, there hasn't
been. Government spending
is growing under Bush,
under Trump.
They're not cutting anything, they're increasing
spending and they're reducing revenues
to finance that spending. That means
the government is going to rely on inflation
and debt to finance.
Yeah, but models show these have a tax cuts
a lot of times bringing higher tax receipts.
They're not going to do that.
They never do that. They're not going to be
the tax receipts won't be enough
to cover the decline, but meanwhile the economy
is going to fall. Higher interest rates
and higher consumer prices
which are constantly
going to be a bigger drag on the economy.
We got to have you back up soon then to really
flesh this out. Wow,
man, I feel like jumping on a cliff now.
No, no, seriously, I'll never commit suicide.
Hillary, don't get me, I was just joking.
All right, Peter Sheff,
if he's right, it'll be a great time for investors
to buy stuff up.
Like the communist Chinese, we'll be back.

Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
Thank you, sir, for doing what you do
and being a patriot and doing your best
to save America and encouraging
us as fellow patriots to do that
in our local areas as well.
And as a long-time
infowarslistener, I want to say thanks

help our other countrymen and women
understand that there's a
bigger problems going on and if we can
get our houses in order and be good
to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Waging war on corruption.
It's Alex Jones coming to
you live from the front lines
of the Infowar.
Tomorrow's news
today.
Next year's news
today.
I'm quite honest
about this. I like Roger
Stone. I've known him about three years.
I met him at a JFK event like seven years ago.
No, no he is for
over a decade. He's a best-selling
author, a whole bunch of best-selling books.
But I knew he worked in a bunch of administrations.
But this is not a butt-kissing
operation. When listeners
think that
I'm talking about how we're tomorrow's news today
to just keep tooting our horn, the globalists
want to control narratives.
They know what's really going on.
It's not that hard once you get studied and get your
mind in the game to know what's really going on.
They just don't want anybody saying it
so they can keep people on the dark.
But we have our listeners, we have our guests,
we have our crew, all of us together
our private intelligence network
and we're going to be promoting America
and freedom. You heard Peter Schiff earlier
about this big bubble we're in
and oh, this and that.
He's heavily invested in China, which is fine.
He thinks that that's going to beat the American economy
because he'd like America to reform. I get it.
But Trump is delivering
in this bubble
real incentives, real jobs, real
build-up in this country.
And culturally, he's not allowing them
to censor, he's trying to block them,
he's promoting pro-life, he's promoting taking care of the veterans,
sovereignty, tax cuts for families
like Putin's done so people have more kids.
I really don't see any fault
in this man.
And everybody wants to kill him
or destroy him because they're playing along
with it and it's easy to take
the middle road because things are so volatile.
I'm betting on America,
I'm betting on Trump
and I'm not going to let him break my will
especially not now that he did that pro-life march
that no Republican would ever do
and called for the states
to take control of the situation which is
constitutional and for an interpersonal
birth abortion. The other presidents don't do that
the other Republicans don't. We are breaking
their back.
So the money is a
side issue
and it is all
crazy town.
But I look at what Trump's doing, he's taking this
mess and trying to
get stuff to the people and trying
to make it cool to have a job and work
and be honorable. Now that said
that's where
I stand.
And so I'm just going to continue to even
support more. Now
getting back to Roger Stone. Roger Stone
we looked it up in
January
in February, in March, in April, in May
in June until the point I said stop it
Shed
the key is the illegal getting of the FISA
warrant the fake dossier
the targeting them lying about it, perjuring to
Congress. Comey saying Trump is crazy
Quoting saying
the key is that we have them open and shut
beyond Nick Sony and who we work for
the only member of the so called plumbers
to not go to jail because he wasn't involved.
The point is is that
that Roger
is absolutely the person
that broke this all of this
and now Congress
Jim Jordan Gates, so I know
Roger helping elected is saying
they've seen it Obama ran
it devastating they're going to prison
they said major officials are going to
prison they sit because they're so dumb
like the memos reportedly had them
going we can't let him get in he's bad
let's get let's make stuff up we need
insurance policy it's the same it's the
president saying it and
rice and all them so stone
you have been absolutely
on target like nobody else I know it's
just true it's true
I mean I really respect you before but it's getting
crazy how accurate we are
without getting into sources and things is obviously
you didn't just pull this out of your rear end
you have advised the president the whole time
this is the proper course
so what's the next shoe to drop because
I mean this is amazing
the crimes they've committed
well it's the biggest
abuse of power that we've ever seen in
American history by any president
it makes what happened in Watergate pale
in comparison
essentially Barack Obama working with the
Clintons doctored up a
phony dossier to use it
as a rationale
to convince the FISA court to
issue warrants to conduct
political espionage on the Republican
candidate for president
and his campaign that
is a constitutional crisis
like we have never had and now
they are busted red
handed back when
circa news first reported that
30,000 Americans
were illegally under surveillance
and the court had even
admonished the NSA
not to do it that it violated the fourth
amendment and they did it
anyway the great lesson
of Watergate as you know Alex is
no person is above
the law or about to find out
because Mr. Clapper
Mr. Brennan Ms. Rice
Valerie Jarrett this list
goes on and on of the
co-conspirators they need to see jail time
our constitution isn't some
joke we are a nation
of laws and they cheated
to try to steal an election
that's right
I know some of it was sources
but the president obviously never told
you classified information but once he got in
he knew he was being spied on he even said that
the boldness of them
on CNN on
MSNBC New York Times
Washington Post you and I by name already
played the clips twice say I'm not going to play them again
Shane Jones and Stone are liars
they're the source to the president they were being
spied on no they said
when he was president elect they were spying on him
then they pulled that back and said they weren't
and then acted like they never said it I mean
the level of lying in plain
view is crazy
no I remember when they asked Clapper about
this under oath he started to
say well it's too sensitive
I can't talk about it of course that's why
we have congressional hearings they are
so busted Alex
and the arrogance of it all
we vowed around the fact that since
Hillary was going to surely win
there'd be no exposure
on their emails that was the arrogance
they were sure where is it I've got it
around here where's my madam president I guess
they're already hung it back up they were so sure
of the madam president that why not just
do whatever they want and run roughshot because
they were planning to shut down the press arrest
everybody I mean they told folks they were
coming after us as soon as
they got in they were going to go full
authoritarian oh there it is I didn't see it there
we're going to go full authoritarian
but it didn't work did it I mean
this is epic
and the dissembling
and the look at the USA
today headline that says
Trump claim of wire capping debunked
no no it wasn't debunked
in fact Judge Andrew Napolitano
was right on the money
when he said that Trump had been
spied on so
it is amazing how the worm
has turned and I think in all honesty
huge credit has to go
to Congressman Jim Jordan
Congressman Matt Gaetz
Congressman
DeSantis these guys have done
a great job they have been
dogged while the country
club Republicans were too busy at their
cocktail parties talking about how
embarrassing Donald Trump is these guys
understood their constitutional
duty as members and they have
and trade out he should be at it as well
that's right they were not sunshine
patriots no they were
they were fighters they know why they
got to Congress they didn't get to
Washington and get lost in the system
and decide that it's go along to get along
they were afraid to make waves I think
huge credits got to go to those and
noon as to all of them are presidential
material now but at the same time
someone needs to examine Adam Schiff
because he appears to be part
of a cover up how is it
that every Democrat on the intelligence
committee voted against
the release of these materials
how is it that no Democratic member
of the House has bothered to go to
a special room that they've set up where
you can examine those that way that's the next question
that noon as
Jordan they're all trying to get it
released just
release it we know what's the word
on what's in that that file
well what we know Alex
is that they went to the FISA
court in in July
asking for the surveillance
of Trump and his team myself
included and they
were shocked when the judge said
no then they came
back several months later
they didn't tell a different judge
that the court had already denied this
that's the key and they
buffaloed him into approving it
and then they were actually laughing about
how dumb the judge was afterwards
so it's it's the
it's the the the connecting
of the dots between the phony dossier
and the government
funding of that after they passed
from republican is the organized criminality
of what they did they're paying for
it lying lying to congress
comey and all of them said that they weren't involved
and said it was insane I mean that there's
that whole other area
you've got you've had perjury in front of the
congress most definitely on the part of
comey extensively
he sat in the same seat that I sat
in in front of the house intelligence committee
and he lied his
career off
but it's okay he's about to teach a course on ethics
yeah
from prison
seriously let's talk
about when is this gonna come out and what does it say
the word is it's got Obama on it
Obama actually basically ordered the judge
to do it we'll be right back

parasites which is anything

we have biological warfare going on everywhere
these are all parasites
tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it
you have the neem in there

available exclusively at infowars.com
you're listening to the Alex Jones show
well talking to Roger Stone
he just got invited to speak to the Oxford Union
I was invited to speak to that
I was the middle of a contentious divorce
so I just couldn't go I couldn't do it
I had to be with my children
but I do want to probably re-accept that
of course there was other invitations
that were accompanying that were more secretive
and then Cambridge invited me right after
that's kind of two warring factions
little little
little bit of the whole
underground stuff that goes on
that I'm not involved in that
that's one another reason I'm not got involved in it all
there's a lot of old secret societies
we'll just leave it at that
but Roger Stone joins us right now
ladies and gentlemen
and
just recapping the bombshell news
that I want to get into
why in heavens would Trump agree
as they're saying he is to meet with Mueller
unless it's to chew him out
and interrogate him about how he got a justice department
waiver to be in business with the Russians
and to chew him out about
how he colluded with Hillary
I wouldn't answer any of his questions
if it's to dress him down and maybe videotape it
then I would do it
why in Hades would Trump meet with him
you know Alex I had dinner
with our mutual friend Judge Andrew Napolitano
the other night and he put it best
this is a perjury trap
this is a
the president would have to have a death wish
to walk into such a one-sided
inquiry
it's almost suicidal
I don't understand why the president
as lawyers said they're now negotiating
over his testimony
I am praying that he will change his mind
it's just
not in his interest but what it proves once again
is that having
run the whole gamut
on Russian collusion and found
nothing we're back to the firing
of Comey again
as the pretext for Trump's impeachment
oh he obstructed justice
or he perjured himself
well don't give it to the mr.
president they need you to incriminate
yourself that's what they're going to try
to trick you into doing
saying something that they can twist
I am praying that the president changes his mind
well he just knows he hadn't done anything
so he thinks why not
they'll make something up he's got a videotape
the whole thing I mean Comey made up memos
said he didn't perjure himself
this is a group created by Clinton's people
by Rosenstein it's a joke
they should all be arrested and that's my next question
what is the next shoot a drop with Jordan
and Gates
and all of them saying nexus criminal charges
for high level officials
I know we don't like to have
internal stuff like this it could trigger a civil war
the democrats are already pushing a civil war
I mean we have to smash
these criminals now
and I know it's dangerous to go up against these thugs
and say that on air whatever somebody's got to do it
they'll never going to go away
you don't have Hitler start World War II
and then in 1945 when you're closing in on Berlin
let him go ahead and stay in Berlin
you know he's going to reconstitute
attack again you got to get him
well what I learned yesterday
Alex is that
Rod Rosenstein the de facto
attorney general of this country
left a time bomb
they had the president signed a document
that changed the order of succession
the order of authority at the justice department
so in other words
if the president ordered Jeff Sessions
to appoint a special counsel
in uranium one
and he declined
he would need to resign
it would then go to Rosenstein
well that's a dead letter
but the president fired Rosenstein
it now doesn't go to the solicitor general
as it did under Nixon and the Archibald Cox filing
goes to a woman named Nancy Brands
a deep stator
a bush-eyed
then it goes to another bush-eyed
then it goes to another bush-eyed
the president would have to get sick deep
in his own administration
to BS to just continually
work against him in the country
well then what does he do about a manifest fraud like that
I mean this organized Clinton cabal
that's still involved in mutinous hijacking
well I would fire
Jeff Sessions immediately
and I'd get myself a fighting attorney general
let's be clear Sessions did this
Sessions just enabled the Cleansanoids
to stay in power
yeah basically I'm sure they said
we're making some structural changes
at the justice department Mr. President
they're going to sign this
it's unimportant
and they go by the way McCabe's your best friend
he's real reasonable when he led the cabal against you
and we I mean exactly
it's like McCabe likes you sir he's very fair
and then McCabe's leading the cabal against you
they don't tell him that
it's time for 5 a.m. raids
at their apartments to seize their computer records
Mueller
Comey, McCabe and Rosenstein
all need government
visits from the FBI
there's very honest men and women
who work at the agency at the lower levels
the rotten crowd is at the top
this place needs a house cleaning
desperately
well I know you and Dr. Jerem Corsi have amazing FBI contacts
who help round up in the 80s
a big Russian network and everything else
you were working for Nixon and all these other anti-communists
you're well known for that
you know a lot of FBI agents what is the word from them
on what's happening and going on
well now they're cheering
most of the agents that I know
were dejected during this election
they knew exactly what was going on
and they hated it but they're company men
and they're mid-level and low-level
men and women
now many of them are very pleased
to see Peter Stroke
and his lover about to get their
just desserts and to see
that the false clothing of Mr. Comey
and Mr. Mueller has been
ripped away and we can see
that this whole cabal is just a
partisan hit squad of Trump haters
they have no regard for law
and the Constitution
well that's my next question
who is going to go to prison because you don't
nearly hear these congressmen and women saying
folks are going to prison the stuff in this memo
is 50 times worse is what they're saying
than what was in the emails and texts
where they're like let's frame the president
I mean that's incredible proof right there
this is way worse and just insane
they're saying what's the word
do you have any intel and who's going to get indicted
I think the key thing for people to understand
is this is the use
of the US government's authority
and power for purposes
of partisan political espionage
10 times worse
than what happened in Watergate
and I have to believe that this goes all the
way to Obama there's no way
that the Obama NSA was
wiretapping Americans surveilling
Americans without the authority
of Obama himself
which means Valerie Jarrett knew
which means Susan Rice knew
Brennan Clapper right on
down the line this entire
nest of criminals needs to be
indicted, convicted,
tried and sent away
we are a nation of laws let me
remind you liberals once again
no person is above the law
sound familiar?
you're going to host about 20 minutes
to the next hour then Lee Ann Mackett is going to be
ride the shotgun with you
so we'll be right back to Roger Stone in the fourth
hour I've got a bunch
of emergency issues to deal with
some good some bad and some very ugly
so I will not be hosting the fourth hour
and Roger's got big news that he is
about to be on top of as well
some more with Roger Stone coming up in a few
minutes remember
they are working around the clock
they are working
around the clock to block us
shut us down you name it
okay and when the history books
are written we'll tell you all about the behind the scene
stuff but we can't do that obviously
because the enemy is watching and it helps them
just know this we need your prayers
we need your support we need everything
Roger Stone is going to come back in two and a half minutes after this break
before I go any further
I hardly even plug I didn't even plug in the first hour
that's my fault if I plug enough
we can find ourselves
I get so obsessed with the info
I'll skip breaks you name it
I just need you to go hey
Alex is delivered he's standing up
he's under attack he's fighting for us
we're fighting for him he's got great supplements
he's got great non-geoma heirloom
seeds and water filters and books
and videos and t-shirts and you name it
let's go spend some time
economically
getting great products at great prices
and supporting the info war
we got a big nut to crack
because I understand equilibrium
we're not going to stay the same
we're going to either shrink or get bigger
and if we shrink we'll be destroyed
I need to surge this year
that means I've already told my wife
I'm going to have to start working 18 hours a day
again no matter what it does to my body
and even though I love my children
more than anything at least
week on week off when my children
one week on and off with my ex-wife some of them
I'm going to work 18 hours a day
I'm going to work 12 hours a day at the other times
with her home and so
you're about to see my full commitment
I am preparing to go into
absolute maniac mode
like I'm dying if I don't win because
I'm going to die if we don't win all of us
we're screwed over by these control freaks
and so
just commit to spread the articles and videos
commit to go to infowarstore.com
we have a big sale that's going to have to end when it sells out

Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
alright the often amazing always incredible Leanne McAdoo is coming up in the next segment final segment with Roger Stone because he's got big breaking things he has to beaver away at he'll be back on the warm at three o'clock today in one hour
central news wars.com present planet.com I barely plugged during the show today because the bigger the news day the more big things are happening I just can't get focused on it but we need to fund our operation
you talk about brand forged about the products you love Roger but separate from that
clearly we're delivering on bringing back America clearly we're under attack and I'm not bitching I'm just letting folks know we're under attack because we're telling the truth
we've changed the world here but all the things Obama's lawyers suing you all the attacks I mean they're trying to destroy us this is total war
so I want to thank the listeners for their support as we entered 2018 but I want to just remind them as I told you on election night man yeah I'm glad Trump got elected now the fight is on
because we've got to make sure this success happens he gets that too or they're going to destroy his name our name they're going to demonize capitalism Christianity this is the big battle right now a lot of folks are betting on China
they're hoping this stalls out they're hoping to get a Jimmy Carter type elected if you know in a few years if this thing stalls so this is a total death battle so let's do that call to arms for support Roger and your own words
for M4store.com because we need folks to commit
you know what I'm finding Alex is that a lot of people are really liking the expanded program David Knight in the morning with real news the war room that Owen Shroyer and I are doing together and of course they love to tune in for you
none of this is possible without listener and viewer support as I say almost every day some people have the impression that we have rich right wing fat cats writing checks to subsidize our operations and that's not true
we depend solely on our listeners and viewers and the patriots out there who support what we do who support our mission and who know we don't have any corporate sponsors in the background saying oh no Alex you can't report that
notice Breitbart got the fat cats and some of them are good or whatever but notice there was treachery and Machiavelli we don't we get zero of that here zero
we have total independence in M4Wars but that's because the people we work for are the people who buy these products we don't have any one person who determines what's said on M4Wars other than the editor in chief
this is the most independent media operation I've ever worked with and that's why it's so important that people support us at the store
where by the way my book the making of the president 2016 which outlines the role that M4Wars played in the nomination of Donald Trump so that he could become president can be gotten at a better price than if you went to Amazon
so folks please go to the store support us and the expansion will be even greater
when I was in Austin I got a tour of the studio in construction which will be state of the art and it will just make for much better stronger pro-freedom commissions broadcasts from Austin and around the globe
and even though that studio is the cutting edge even Fox News doesn't have one like this $600,000 I don't have a private jet or a mansion it goes back into this it's the satellites we're about to pay for three new satellites we have thousands of TV stations that are literally there
we have to do at least three it's a million and a half bucks a year this closed cab seating is $100,000 a year we don't have the money right now so I've got to hustle do some things
we got one satellite right now it's not the one stations want we've already got a bunch of stations picking it up
so we're in a big push right now folks and I'm about to sign big checks and soon I'll be able to talk about the stuff behind the scenes it's been unbelievable
and I don't bitch about the attacks I expected them but it's just if people could see it you'd really support
infowarstore.com infowarslife.com get the supplements they're life changing but what you know is life changing is the information warfare

music
I am Leanne McAdoo coming to you live and last minute from my studio here in Florida so good to be back with you all we've got so much to talk about
obviously the big bombshell right now is this FISA memo everyone's talking about it except of course the establishment media they don't want to talk about this they don't think it's a big deal
something that whispers and rumblings that this could send people to jail very top level people could be facing jail time but that's not important
that's not important to people like Chris Cuomo over at CNN he doesn't want to talk about that you know it's just more of a look over here show that they're putting on is what we're being told
the Republicans have nothing so I'm really interested to find out what's going on and we'll play a little flashback video because just last week we had former secret service agent Dan Bongino saying something is about to happen
that there is something a brewing an explosive scandal ready to burst dealing with this dirty dossier so imagine being Hillary Clinton and the DNC and people who thought this dossier was going to bring down Trump and it's actually backfiring
and man this is a scandal that is they're saying it's going to really finally undo President Obama's savior image once and for all so I want to go ahead and play that clip with Dan Bongino where he's talking about what's breaking this week
Dan why is this problematic? Gosh where do we start with this case this is the biggest mess I'm telling you it's the most explosive scandal it's getting ready to burst with this OIG report coming out now
but on this specific incident it's about the Trump transition record emails with GSA why not get a warrant I was a federal investigator for 12 years and a local police officer for four
well worked with a police officer for two years as a cop why not get a warrant in the most consequential counterintelligence investigation in American history why not
basically because this is a hoax I said to you for the show we're asking all the wrong questions here the question the juror has been what was the dossier used to get a warrant on Trump
wrong question important question but the wrong one the real question is why get a warrant at all why was the Trump team being spied on nobody has pointed out one single predicate crime to point out why Donald Trump's team is being spied on not one
exactly I mean are the Democrats okay with this are they okay because it was President Obama and his DOJ and his buddies that were actually involved in this scandal and surveilling a citizen a private citizen at that point
President Trump hadn't even clenched the nomination and you know for some reason even with the votes against releasing this and declassifying this FISA memo saying no no no the American people they don't need to know about this
why I mean are they okay with this abuse of power this apparent abuse of power because you know I guess that means that they're they're going to let the tyrant Trump turn around and do the same thing coming up in 2018 and 2020
I mean this is a real problem and that is why people are saying this is huge the American people need to know at the very least release the memo so that it will stop all the conspiracy theories that are going to play out because of this
this is a memo circulating on the hill but it was written by Republicans classified by Republicans why why don't they just get it declassified there they're putting it on the the the Democrats to declassify it so it is kind of a game that's being played right now
a lot of people are also saying well why doesn't the president just declassify that original FISA order in the first place so we can see who you know who was really behind all of this I feel like if the president were to do something like that he would still be turned into the
he would be demonized it wouldn't make as big of a splash and we all know that president Trump has a flair for the dramatic so perhaps he is you know holding out to really really underscore and completely rewrite the legacy of the former president
and his administration and so many people are saying that this is going to be completely devastating and that once and for all it is going to be the toughest pill to swallow for the media who has just really been riding on this Russian collusion narrative and trying you notice when it all sort of
circled back around to the Democrats with this dossier that kind of got pushed away kind of got silenced and so you know it's interesting that this broke last night I couldn't get any sleep because the release the memo hashtag went viral on
Twitter the fact that was even allowed to go viral on Twitter was very interesting in itself maybe Jack must have been asleep or something to allow that to go viral but this this memo is naming and shaming those who sought to deliberately undermine and obstruct
Trump's presidency so this is a big deal and so let's go to another video that we have a rep congressman Matt Gates he's actually talking to Fox News explaining a little bit about this this FISA memo it's a long clip so we'll just try to get into the
meat of it here he's saying that this could end the Mueller investigation once and for all have you seen the memo sir yes or no I have and I share the concerns that have just been expressed by Congressman Meadows and Congressman Jordan our
public is in jeopardy if we allow this type of a palace coup environment to continue to persist and that's why I'm one of the members of Congress who will be encouraging today intelligence chairman Devin Nunes to release the memo we can have a vote in the
intelligence committee a vote of the full House of Representatives and this is a matter of such importance that I think we need to do it immediately I mean listening to some of this reaction characterize what's in the memo
what's it say unfortunately I can't get into the specific details in a top secret document but that's why we have to release it I don't think it's appropriate for just members of Congress to be horrified by the activities that were that were
undertaken during this endeavor and that's why we've got to allow the American people to see it I will tell you this bill if we get this memo into the public square heads are going to roll at the FBI and at the
Department of Justice one comment no way everyone one comment said it was like the KGB this is really strong language is the suggestion that the abuse on behalf of federal government was indeed spying on Americans without their
knowledge and without proper legal authority yes or no again that would get into the specific contents of the memo I can tell you that we can never live in a country where this type of thing happens and particularly
the authentication processes that are laid out in the memo are of such fiction they are so laughable that they would never withstand scrutiny from the public and what I'm worried about is that the cast of characters
identified in this memo is not a group of people who are gone many of these people are still in our government they still wield influence and that's why we've got to get this information out of public
you just said people will be fired at the FBI and Department of Justice possibly worse I think that there could be people who could face criminal consequences as a result of the activities that are laid out in this memo
and it's easy to see after reading this memo why Senator Grassley and why Senator Graham wanted to refer this matter for criminal prosecution laws were broken this is a big deal here will we see it yes or no
yes I have every confidence after speaking with Paul Ryan and Devin Nunes that after we go through the right procedures and provide the adequate notice to the executive branch that we will release this memo
but we need the public to continue to call for it and I'm encouraged that within the last half hour there've been over 20,000 tweets on Twitter with the hashtag release the memo it shows that the American public is demanding more transparency
and that's really how we drain the swamp in Washington DC more transparency more sunshine it's the best antidote to corruption you've said a lot Matt Gaetz the Republican there from the hill we await to see it then absolutely thank you for your time
thank you right the American people deserve to know if there is evidence of illegal FBI and DOJ buying on the Trump campaign at the behest of whom Hillary Clinton president Barack Obama who who ordered this whose heads are going to roll with this memo we do want to know
this is something that's you know pretty incredible and we're going to have more on this in a minute I want to get into Cuomo talking about you can just see the nerves there trying to you know tell us why this is so important why do the American people need to know
now sneaky Diane Feinstein release the whole Glenn Simpson testimony with Fusion GPS because she felt pressured by some person you know American people needed to know that but we'll get into this a little bit more right after the short break

defending the republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex Jones
all right welcome back to the Alex Jones show I am Leanne McAdoo hosting the fourth hour and we've got a lot of clips to run through here let's talk about this looming government shutdown that is you know got everyone's feathers ruffled of course we know no matter what it is going to be blamed on the republicans well they just wouldn't
cow to the demands of the democrats we know that's going to happen either way so today at today's white house press briefing this was kind of brought up like
you know you want to say this is a Schumer's shut down because the democrats are refusing to work with the republicans but you know the republicans control the house and the senate and the white house so you know can't the republicans just get this done no that's not really how it works and so the director of the
office of management and budget Mick Mulvaney actually slammed Jim Acosta and said come on buddy you know as well as everyone that's just not how it works
how can it be the Schumer shutdown when republicans control the white house the house and the senate come on you know the answer to that as well as anybody I mean I have to laugh when people say that oh we control the house and the senate the white house why can't you get this done you know as well as
anybody that it takes 60 votes in the senate to pass appropriations no right you know that I know okay so if you only have 51 votes in the senate then you have to have democrat support in order to keep the government to fund the government so that's the answer to
your question. The president asked congress to come up with a solution for the dreamers congress was in the room members of congress room with president last week I seem to be a fairly productive meeting and then the whole process got blown up. It seems that the whole process was blown up by the president's
combat. When republicans tried to add a discussion about Obamacare to the funding process in 2013 we are accused by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer of inserting a non fiscal a non financial issue into the spending process in order to shut the
government down how is that not exactly what is happening today there is no reason you have to deal with DACA this week there's no reason you have to deal with DACA before the end of February excuse me the middle of February DACA doesn't expire till March 5th this is purely an
attempt by the senate democrats led by Mr. Schumer it's why we call it the Schumer shutdown in order to try and get a shutdown that they think this president gets blamed for.
Right and of course so if there's no compromise on the budget by midnight this shutdown will be finalized and you know like Mulvaney points out they're trying to push something on DACA and the dreamers and it's just not necessary.
Now yeah maybe if we were dealing with the former administration and many administrations before this one. It does take forever to get anything done in Congress but the president already said he had that open door transparent meeting all the press was invited
he said look I'm gonna sign whatever you guys send me I'm not it's whatever you send me if you guys are able to work together and compromise I'm gonna sign it we're not going to be going back and forth so we can hold off on dealing with the dreamers we don't need to wrap that up in this in
this budget it doesn't have anything to do with keeping the government open so the democrats are trying to derail and hold the government hostage in order to get their the demands of their illegal immigrants met totally crazy so I was seeing this narrative coming up
on Twitter well you know the republicans control everything why don't they just pass it and that's not how it works but CNN and Jim Acosta was just gonna run with this narrative can you imagine if they would have just ran with this narrative and Mulvaney never would have
checked him and said come on that's not you know that you need 60 votes to be able to pass this through the Senate why would you even put out that fake news that propaganda but that's what we're dealing with here so there's a video actually by John Bowne where he talks about Jim Acosta being
compared to Charles Manson who working for the Cyop organization let's go ahead and roll that President Trump to Joseph Stalin who called by calling the free press quote the enemy of the people well I'm saying you borrowed that phrase it was popularized by Joseph Stalin used by now as well
the enemy of the people nothing to see here folks just more yellow journalism being forced fed you by the Gellin organization offshoot over there at the operation mockingbird headquarters established in the 1950s by Frank
Wissner Director of the Office of Policy Coordination a covert operations unit created by the United States National Security Council as early as the 1950s CBS Newsweek and the New York Times were Wissner's back pocket
Phil Graham of the Washington Post ran the cabal of journalists for Wissner that would control the public mind and operation that continues to this very day Edward Bernays said we are governed our minds molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested are these
Cyop organization not the very definition of an enemy of the people Thomas Jefferson wrote we hold these truths to be self evident so from the very beginning our freedom has been predicated on truth the founders were visionary in this regard
understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America the enemy of the people was how the president of the United States called the free press in 2017
Mr. President it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies it bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase enemy of the people that even the key to
Cruz Jeff forbade its use telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of quote annihilating such individuals unquote who disagreed with the Supreme Leader and if it's okay to compare the president of the
United States to Joseph Stalin who was responsible for the deaths of roughly 20 million people can we now start comparing Jim Acosta to Charles Manson they've both used cultish disinformation to persuade their followers to consider hostile irrationality against the status quote
Mr. President did you say that you want more people to come in from Norway did you say that you wanted more people to come in from Norway is that true Mr. President I want him to come in from everywhere everywhere thank you very much everybody just Caucasian or white country sir
or do you want people to come in from other parts of the world where there are people of color when the gloves completely came off after the quiet suffocation of the 65 year old Smith Monact that was tucked away in Obama's 2013 NDA a unshackling Obama State Department to allow total propaganda to run like a
feral cat through the collective consciousness of the United States the Smith month Modernization Act of 2012 passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act will allow the CIA to flood America with more government propaganda Frank church revealed
in 1975 how the establishment media works hand in glove with the CIA I thought that it was a matter of real concern that planted stories intended to serve a national purpose abroad came home and were circulated here and believed here
because this would mean that the CIA could manipulate the news in the United States by channeling it through some foreign country you see sensationalism has always sold paper and of course that cultish disinfo has only increased ever since the repeal of the Smith

just going to sign them and we'll send them out you know i wanted to talk about something that just i couldn't stop laughing really about this very sad gallup poll that is making the rounds today as if we care what the rest of the world
thinks about president trump's leadership style but apparently that's big news for some of these other media outlets out there so it's a poll under trump global approval of us leadership hits historical low it's a historical low of 30% in
2017 this is other nations approval of the us leadership under president trump and so they're saying this measure signals an 18 point drop from just a year earlier when 48% approved of the national influence under former president
barack obama wow so what does this mean this means that nearly half of the world likes it when the us leads by capitulating and cow touting and and you know bowing down to militant isis commanders and bank rolling
state sponsors of terrorists in iran and sending them billions of dollars in unmarked bills and you know say hey guys don't spend this money on acquiring a nuclear weapon or sponsoring any terrorism am i right
you know the strategic patients that the leadership style of obama he exercised that strategic patients with a nuclear armed madman rocket man the baby right and so this is the soft leadership style that apparently nearly half of the the world would
prefer they they like that sell out teleprompter president obama who you know turned us basically into the united states of apologists so it's no wonder that these globalists and these leaders around the world prefer that
obama they prefer the guy that was such a great negotiator that he got the us tied up in all these really bad deals that president trump is now having to undo so what does this say that in just one year
this approval rating around the world could could just tank oh my goodness what could trump possibly have done to to rattle these guys well he's cut funding to terrorists he stopped sending billions of dollars to the united nations to help support
these nations that absolutely do not have our best interest at heart they don't respect us when it comes time to make decisions that are going to serve American interests he's putting America first in these trade negotiations and putting
American safety first with immigration versus you know the demands of illegal immigrants he has allowed our generals to actually decide when to strike terrorists so in just a year we're seeing the near defeat of isis he's
he's bringing jobs back to the united states you know that we got a store in stock market he's he respects the flag the rule of law so no wonder these globalists don't like him they're like wait you're making America great again we had just destroyed you
man so anyway here's the president Trump's approval rating continuing to tank around the globe screw you guys because Obama's gone now I want to go ahead and play this clip that already going the FCC manipulating the response of the masses Alex Jones report
remember F. Lee Bailey the famous corrupt lawyer you're known for big problems a million dollar fines you name it remember F. Lee Bailey on the OJ Simpson trial they had a white guy do it get up and say the N word over and over
and over and over again to the black jury and that's how they got him off he said the N word 41 times I want to go to YouTube and grab it for documentary purposes they aired it on court TV ABC NBC NBC but I remember years later
years later airing on talk radio on the station manager coming and saying you don't do that and that's the big issue CNN MSNBC broadcast you name it on CBS ABC they are saying every 10 minutes they're playing the clip
every time every minute of quoting the president when he says he didn't say it saying these are SH you know what T countries we've got a cost to saying it we've got them all saying it on CNN you name it again just like F. Lee Bailey
saying the N word over and over and over and over again you can't use it but of a liberal fraudulent corrupt lawyer in my view wants to use it to manipulate a jury and let it can you know clearly a guilty man go free as we now know
if you want to do that you are a bad person if you're not the establishment but if you're the establishment you can so CNN to inflame emotions ABC NBC CBS MSNBC they're all quoting the president
as saying this and saying it to get people out of their comfort zone on mainstream TV to suddenly hear them cussing if I cuss or a caller slips through our stations complain we've lost affiliates before because the FCC will selectively find them
or Howard Stern if he wants to say SHIT he had to leave terrestrial radio because sometimes it was slipped through but now mainstream media they can all do it because the executives are saying go full bore do whatever you want take them out
and now they've got former democrat governors on info wars dot com saying they will punch out the president hashtag hunt republicans they'll kill republicans this is what they say and people are getting attacked hot coffees getting thrown on them
they're getting shot they're getting beat up they're getting their families assaulted and they think it's funny as they usher this country towards civil war and notice the left hadn't come out that I've seen and denied the new documents that came out from the
post group trying to trigger martial law and race riots when Obama had only a year left in office see that story up on info wars dot com incredible I believe the president that he didn't say it but we've seen them lie about him over and over again
I could say that sources say the president snorts methamphetamine in the White House off hooker's rear ends not true but if I said it on CNN they would all parrot it to give it credibility and it's the same thing you never hear them say those things on television they're
not supposed to under the FCC but they're doing it because they want to stick the knife in turn the edge and then put salt in the wound total manipulation

you're listening to the alex jones show
from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
watch me, watch me, I got it, watch me
welcome back to the alex jones show this is the last segment I'll be with you Leigh Ann McAdoo coming live from Florida and right now we are really witnessing the media crumbling they're in a panic the only thing they've got is name calling
there's so much winning with President Trump he's really trying to bring people together and actually attempting to be the most transparent administration ever by holding these open door meetings and Jim Acosta wants to say well you know we could have got DACA
Trump said but then he used bad language so it's off the table now I mean all of these excuses and it's it's people are wearing is wearing us down I mean people are really tired of this and so it's not a wonder that trust in the mainstream media is at an all time low
people know and believe that they are being lied to that stories are being made up that videos are being edited and that's why people couldn't get enough of Trump's fake news awards and they were like yes please do this and so I guess in an effort to
you know undo some of that apparent bias that has earned them top billing on the fake news awards we have the New York Times and CNN other outlets actually talking to real life Trump supporters and not just the crazy circus freaks that they try to find at every rally
to say well look I told you they're all racist no they're actually talking to just your average American educated cares about their country concerned with what's what's happening here and these were done this week Wednesday Thursday in a series of
letters to the editor in the New York Times and they just printed the letters and allowed these Trump supporters to to say and make their best case for why they support the president and why they think he's doing a good job and this is newsworthy
because the paper comes out right and they admit that they've been overly critical of the president and that they are printing all these dark stories about him and admitting they don't normally give a voice to Trump supporters so again and they're doing this in the
period of open debate so all of these these are really great if you've got the ability to access these new york new york times articles and read some of them they make a really good case for giving these president that high marks for his progress they talk about him
and nearly defeating ISIS cutting taxes for middle class families making those great court appointments prioritizing American citizens over illegal immigrants you know getting us out of those really bad deals the TPP on day one before he even went to his parade my goodness
and of course you know putting real pressure on North Korea and Iran you know newsflash not everyone is Hillary Clinton's deplorables of a lot of Trump supporters are well informed and care about the country and so this was you know it seemed as if it's
an effort by the New York Times to be more fair and balanced but that's not what's happening here when CNN goes and wants to talk to those former Democrats who switched and vote for Trump oh well we want to hear how do you feel a year later were you happy with
your decision they don't care I mean it's just like the drive by journalism they did right after the election when they went out to places and painted all the Trump voters as these poor people in these factory towns who just were duped by
this president and he's not really going to do anything for them lo and behold a year later jobs are coming back more money in people's pockets and so what's really happening here is the media is trying to regain a lot of that lost audience
they had and they want to bring in those Trump supporters and say look guys we know we've been unfair we're going to give you a shot we're going to let you air your grievances and print your letters to the editor will be we're going to hire some
conservative columnist like Brett Stevens at the New York Times but what they don't tell you is that these conservative columnists are never Trumpers so even though they're trying to get away from their coastal in the elitist liberal bias that they've really been
dragged with they're trying to say you know we're we're being more fair about it's it's they're never Trumpers so any story that you're going to get out of these outlets even though they're giving a conservative slant they're going to be filtered
through that negative never Trump or bias and so that's what's happening here this is to try to regain some of that objectivity for the 2018 elections coming up 2018 and 2020 they want to try and dupe us into believing that they are now all of a sudden going to be objective
because again after the repeal or the Smith month modernization act in 2012 went into effect in 2013 that was really when you could see the media losing all objectivity they didn't even try to hide the fact that they were support Hillary Clinton and that there's
so much opinion and bias in their reporting I mean it's just incredible if people aren't familiar with that Smith month modernization act that was put in place back in the 40s to stop the CIA and the government from
pushing propaganda on US citizens they were pumping it out to the rest of the world but you know they weren't supposed to be pro pushing propaganda on the United States that was revealed at the church hearings and so then with this Smith month modernization
as defined by you know good old president Obama they're allowed to push propaganda now they don't have to hide it and by golly they sure have been especially with this dirty dossier now I want to go to another clip this one is Rob do and Alex Jones
and they talk about you know speaking of propaganda think about Silicon Valley Twitter Facebook how they're controlling the information that we are allowed to read and to speak it's all a form of that control and that that's
let's go to this this report by Alex Jones and Rob do knowing the power of the people knowing that was coming on the Internet they created these things so people would make it big and then now they come in and censor it while they want to censor any other site these
things that we had us but it's a fraud it's racketeering it's fake advertising it's discrimination we hit them there but like Matt drudge said and as I've said we got to create our own websites like info wars dot com or news wars dot com we've got to create our own platforms
and listeners have to go to those platforms realizing and share that info realizing that it's all up to us if you go to news wars dot com or prison planet dot com and if you go there and if you share those links on the enemies platforms with your own
email your own by hand they can't stop us so at the end of the day it's up to you but they are already ratcheted us down but because we fought so hard we've stayed the same size last year which is completely confounded them so they're in panic mode that's why they have congressional
hearings everything else because it's not working well the answer is sue congressman quickly saying shut us down as fake news for civil rights violations and we're behind the scenes suing people they'll be public lawsuits don't worry but we're doing it
you were ahead of your time by creating you created a social media platform years ago it ended up you know kind of dying well I got infiltrated and it wasn't all fancy with CIA money but right right you didn't have CIA backing you didn't have the push to the front but still it's people that need to make things
like that like their own social media sites to take away and then gab did and google bans it on there and then calls for it to be shut down right they don't want competition
and it's like hey if you don't like what the people are saying on gab don't respond to them or don't put don't follow them but it's way beyond all that we're under total criminal censorship attack oh yeah
bizos is making a billion dollars every two days off the scams he runs in government funding the washington post is literally the enemy of this country because we keep being reasonable right you know keep us kind of looking at the facts and the evidence and oh debate in this and polishing that the globalists are absolutely in total war against the recovery against the president against all of us yeah
no more just shitting there like pundits analyzing this and and James O'Keefe hit it on the head they use the word sh i t t y because we can't do that we're not upper class elite liberals they're allowed to say this is documentary and they're okay we can't and three hours later
they come out with the same thing oh Trump said this who do we have we have people according to people familiar with their reactions those people aren't even in the meeting according to people familiar with their people meeting say didn't say it of course they're lying of course
garbage they found people that only want social media power they get the dopamine of getting promoted so they don't care what the truth is there can be a cure for for death these people don't want it they have chosen people in these things that are
literally pure scum and so some say the answer is leave Facebook Twitter and Google and I agree the president needs to break it up Google Facebook and Twitter are a greater threat than Hitler who wanted to conquer the world because they're
scientific they're committed they're evil they're using psychology so I agree it's now time to shut down Google they want to shut our speech down it just hit me fine it is time to have congressional hearings and all of it and I just break it up
it's time for Google Facebook Twitter and all these groups as criminal international crime syndicates with everybody's personal data as we're going to break next Monday sharing our photos our videos turning our cameras on recording it as intelligence agencies
it's time for Facebook Google Twitter to be shut down as criminal operations just like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany it is time to shut them down
