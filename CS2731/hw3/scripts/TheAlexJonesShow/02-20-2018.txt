You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
We are live in February 20th, 2018, the Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
I'll be in for Alex for the first two hours then.
In the second two hours after that, the third and fourth hours, it will be the one and only
Milo Unopolis, but we've got a ton of news to cover right now.
Top of the agenda being the increasing polarization of America as the culture wars intensify.
It's a fever pitch like never before.
We have a top headline up on Infowars.com right now, which is also on drudgerport.com.
Kill the NRA sign appears on billboard in Louisville.
We saw the Facebook account last week, which of course, this all brewed up after the school
shooting in Florida.
The Facebook account, where they actively encouraged and incited people to go out and
shoot Republicans as a revenge for the Florida high school shooting.
Now it's gone into high gear.
We've got this kill the NRA sign appearing on a billboard in Louisville.
Again, in response to last week's shooting, the billboard, which appears on Interstate
65, was an act of vandalism, according to the company that owns the billboard.
So it wasn't an actual ad by they're saying they're taking it down.
There's no sign it's actually being taken down.
The words resist 45 also appear on the site.
So this was obviously put up by radicalized insane hyperpartisan, anti-Trump resistance
members and a spokeswoman for out front media, the company that owns the billboard, said
that it's being taken down, but wave three news got the exclusive on this.
And basically people are saying, once again, this is encouraging violence.
Again, this is after the school shooting.
They're actively calling on people to kill NRA members as a response to that shooting.
After Facebook finally closed down this group, they removed the posts as we highlighted last
week after our big story on it, which was also top of Drudge Report.
They closed down the Facebook group of people openly inciting shooters, killers, crazed
killers to copy James T. Hodgkinson, who of course was the shooter of Congressman Steve
Scalise, they called on people to go out and get blood, get a revenge blood attack against
NRA members against Republicans in response to the shooting.
What is going on in America?
How hyperpartisan has the political environment become where this kind of thing is happening?
Kill the NRA signs.
This has been up since Friday.
It hasn't even been taken down yet.
It's Tuesday.
It's three, four days later.
It's still up there.
No sign of it being taken down.
This is the political climate that we're dealing with, that people can be allowed to do this,
and there's basically going to be no backlash whatsoever.
These are the times we're living in.
This is an anti-Trump resistance message calling on people to kill NRA members in response
for this school shooting.
Absolutely incredible.
Meanwhile, we also have this story in a similar vein, far left writer calls on black people
to start barking at white people who quote, speak out of turn.
This is not the onion.
This is not a parody of far left social justice warriors.
This is an actual call for black people in the spirit of the movie Black Panther, in
which this takes place, to bark at white people to make them shut up.
How unhinged, how insane do you need to be to even entertain this?
Now, obviously, the article is written tongue in cheek style, but it's the guy actually
calling for this to happen.
This is not a parody.
He says quote, we're too infected with colonization and the myriad of residues and peripheral
effects.
He's talking about Wakanda.
He's talking about Black Panther.
He then goes on to actually encourage black people to silence white people, not just
be platform them, but silence them by barking at them.
For example, if a woman's walking down an alleyway and she's passing, say, a gang of
black people, she grabs her purse.
This guy says that those black guys should just start literally barking at a woman in
an alleyway.
That's one of the examples he gives.
If somebody's going in an elevator and they clutch their purse, they're also calling for
people to bark at white people, to shut them up, to put them in their place.
Absolutely incredible hyper-partisan times.
This is the kind of insanity we're dealing with.
We'll be back after the break.
Introducing Cell Force by InfoWar's Life Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency
and protection.
Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
They are your body's cellular engines.
Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
like a cellular engine overhaul.
Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
reactive oxygen species.
Stop scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
these reactive oxygen species.
The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
species and other free radicals.

You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
We're live, it is, the Alex Jones Show, I was talking about this article which is up
on infowars.com as of a couple of hours ago.
Headline, far left right to calls on black people to start barking at white people who
speak out of turn.
Now, this is in reference to the Black Panther movie, which is smashing all records, big
hit at the box office, obviously, more power to them.
Kind of ironic, given that it promotes literally an ethno state with no immigration and zero
refugees, but we'll get onto that in a second.
This is a writer by the name of Damon Young at the Root, which is a massive, far left
social justice warrior website.
He's calling on black people to start barking at white people who, quote, speak out of turn.
Now let's read what he actually says in this article because it has to be heard to be believed.
He says, one thing that we can and definitely should start doing is what Mbacow and his
K dog, Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking
when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic
white dudes, that perennial woe.
Bark.
That's right, bark.
He literally wants people to start barking at others to make them shut up.
He says, not a purposeless bark.
This isn't a shitsuit barking through the window at a squirrel.
Instead, this would be an intentional bark, a targeted bark, an overpowering bark, a drowning
bark, a Wakandian bark, a bark meant to communicate who told you that you can speak.
When it's time for your words, we will let you know, but maybe that time will never come.
That's right.
Shut up, bigot.
How dare you have an opinion?
How dare you speak because of your skin color?
We're literally going to bark at you because of your skin color and tell you to shut up.
But where the anti-racist, okay, he continues, we'll see.
Now just shut up and stand there.
Maybe get on your phone and Google how not to be a colonizer.
Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.
So he's literally in an article telling white people to shut up because of their skin color.
And this is a website that postures itself as an anti-racist website, okay?
Coming out with the most virulent, vile racism you can imagine.
And yeah, of course, some of it's tongued in cheek, but he's serious.
He's serious with this.
He goes on to advocate, listen to this, opening a school of Wakandan white silencing while
providing several examples of when white people should be barked at.
This is inexcusable behavior on behalf of white people, and this deserves being barked
at like they're literally being de-platformed because of their skin color, which is what
he's advocating.
He says, away with white hand reaches for your hair.
Woof, woof, woof.
And of course, he's talking about this whole meme amongst the far left, which is, oh, white
people always want to touch black people's hair.
I mean, that happens with anyone who gets any kind of funky hairstyle, whether they're
black or white.
Oh, by the way, if you're white, you can't have dreadlocks either.
That's racist.
That's cultural appropriation.
So he says, if a white person tries to touch a black person in any way, they should be
barked at.
He gives another example, a group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refused to step
aside when you attempt to walk past them.
Woof, woof, woof.
The purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator.
Woof, woof, woof.
So if a young lady on her own gets into an enclosed space with a group of guys, she should
be barked at.
She should be intimidated, again, because she's white.
These are the anti-racist speaking, by the way.
He continues, if they're going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.
So he's openly advocating, scaring and intimidating women in enclosed spaces.
Oh, but they're the anti-sexist, they're the anti-racist, okay.
So again, I continue in this article, despite its tongue-in-cheek nature, the article is
yet another example of how identity politics obsessed progressives using the Black Panther
movie to stoke more racism and more division amongst Americans, which of course has now
kicked into high gear.
We had the first black president, race relations worse than ever, and these people are exacerbating
the problem.
Those people on the far right are exacerbating the problem as well.
They both need each other.
That's why the media gives the alt-right and the far-right so much attention because they
need each other to continue fanning the flames of this hysteria, this division.
The irony of this, of course, is pretty stunning.
Given that Wakanda, the fictional East African nation in which Black Panther is set, bears
all the hallmarks of an alt-right utopia.
There's actually a meme that I posted on Twitter where it shows all the characteristics, all
the traits of Wakanda, this fictional East African country.
Wakanda is anti-immigration, isolationist, pro-wall.
It's literally surrounded by walls to protect it.
It has strict trade restrictions.
It's anti-diversity.
It's ethno-nationalist.
It's anti-refugee.
It's anti-democracy.
In fact, they literally have a quote in the Black Panther movie which says, quote, refugees
bring their problems with them.
That's how they explain the fact that they're not going to allow any immigration.
So by any score, Black Panther and Wakanda is an alt-right dream.
If you want to really boil it down to its core characteristics, the alt-right, the far-right,
the racist, the racist Trump supporters should love this movie because it's basically everything
they advocate.
It takes it to the extreme.
And yet this movie has been used again for division in these hyper-partisan times and
now literally somebody at the root is calling on Black people to start barking at white
people to intimidate them into silence or simply to intimidate women on their own.
And these people, again, they're the anti-racists.
We're the racists.
So Black Panther is doing extremely well at the box office as the culture was intensified.
Actually, people who've watched the film have told me, haven't had a chance to watch it,
but people who've watched it and reviewed it have basically said that it's basically
a battle between hyper-ethno-nationalism, Black supremacy, and the main character who
at the end of the movie becomes more of a classical liberal and reason and logic tends
to win the day.
So this movie is the complete opposite of what everyone thinks it is with this whole
liberation theology they've invested into.
It's actually, from one perspective, it's an alt-right dream and from another, the whole
Black Lives Matter mantra gets demolished in the movie because they're the bad guys.
So whatever people are transposing onto this Black Panther movie isn't really working out.
There you see a screenshot that I did for my video with the main character with the
Make America Great Again hat on because again, a lot of aspects of Wakanda are stuff that
literally Trump has advocated and is trying to implement.
But no, that doesn't matter, they're just using this film for division.
Meanwhile, another headline here, Hollywood elites blast Clint Eastwood's film for not
portraying sympathetic terrorists.
Now this is exactly what I predicted would happen.
So Clint Eastwood made a movie, very interesting movie, it's definitely one I want to watch,
about the Paris train attack.
You remember that a couple of years ago where the terrorists tried to carry out a massacre
on a train heading to Paris.
Those three US soldiers intervened, stopped a terrorist attack.
One of them was Black, by the way.
He's literally a Black hero because he plays himself in the movie as well.
So you've got an actual Black hero, not somebody prances around in a leotard on a stage like
in Black Panther, but an actual African-American hero who stopped a terrorist, nobody knows
about him, nobody cares about him.
But Clint Eastwood's movie, 1517 to Paris, they use the same guys who actually stopped
the terrorists, the original guys are in the movie.
Of course Clint Eastwood's a conservative, Hollywood literally has to have secret societies
of conservatives simply for them to be able to talk to each other and still have careers.
They have to do it behind the scenes, it's all hush hush.
So now a wave of negative reviews is pouring in for Clint Eastwood's movie and we're going
to read some of them here.
Slant magazine talks about the film's departure from the surprisingly visceral and nuanced
book and says that one misses the prismatic structure of 1517 to Paris and basically they
go on to say that the terrorist in the movie who is stopped by the heroes is not portrayed
sympathetically enough.
Pittsburgh Post Gazette, even UK Daily Mail chastises this movie for its obsession with
firearms and again the fact that the terrorist is portrayed as a bad guy, God forbid.
Imagine if there was a white supremacist with an AK-47 who tried to massacre people on a
train and then Hollywood made a movie about it.
Would the reviewers at the Daily Mail, at the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, at the Daily
Mail database, would the reviewers be complaining about the fact that the white supremacist
terrorist wasn't portrayed sympathetically enough?
Look at it that way and yet that's exactly what they're doing with this Clint Eastwood
movie while they fawn and worship at the feet of the Black Panther movie.
Very interesting clash there, very interesting case study for the intensified culture wars
that we're now experiencing in America.
We'll be back to talk about it after the break in 4Wars.com.

Now I was talking before the break about this new Clint Eastwood movie, the 1517 to Paris.
East at the same time as Black Panther, now I'm not saying that it's on the same level
as Black Panther.
Obviously Black Panther is a huge Marvel blockbuster, it's got a giant budget probably
like 10, 15 times bigger than Clint Eastwood's, but this is a movie that interested me because
the original story interested me, and because the three main actors are the real heroes
who stopped the actual terrorists, I mean I'm not going to expect Oscar level acting
skills from them, but that's not why the movie is being denounced.
It's being denounced because they don't treat the terrorists with enough kid gloves and
enough sympathy.
The Daily Beast, a reviewer at The Daily Beast, stated the film was quote, more mind-numbing
than his empty chair speech and called it a stunning misfire of the terrorists at The
Daily Beast.
As for the villain in question, Eastwood primarily films his hands, sneakers, arms and back,
all as means of making him some sort of faceless existential threat, a symbolic vehicle for
Stone's greater purpose.
Now of course, why they did that is because they want all the attention, all the glory
to go to the actual American heroes that stopped the terrorists.
That's why they're all endlessly focused on the terrorists himself, but the Pittsburgh
Post Gazette review lamented the exclusion of quote, any hint of the terrorist motivation.
So again, they're more interested in the excuses as to why the terrorists carried out the attack.
Maybe it was, you know, France's involvement in the war against ISIS or whatever.
But again, that's not what the focus of the movie was about.
The focus of the movie is about the heroes.
That literally triggered all these far left reviews because we can't have American heroes
being depicted as American heroes.
There has to be some kind of divisive wedge issue or some kind of identity politics obsession
inserted into every single movie.
I mean, they're now saying the BAFTAs, which is the UK film awards.
If they don't have a diversity message in the movie by 2019, it's not going to be even
considered for an award.
It's literal reeducation brainwashing to the point where if these movies don't pass
purity tests, if they don't fall to left wing dogmas, to left wing obsession with identity
politics, they're going to get bad reviews.
I mean, that is the ultimate kind of communist system where all the art has to be filtered.
All the movies has to be filtered through this government censor before it can even be commented
on in any kind of neutral way.
I mean, that is chilling.
Even the Daily Mail wrote, which is a typically right wing publication, wrote about this movie,
the Clint Eastwood movie, that is three heroes, quote, in that sacred American way, that Christianity
is not incompatible with an obsession with firearms, continued that the narrative throbs
with Eastwood's conviction shared as we know by President Trump, that the best way to stop
a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.
So they can't tolerate for a second the message that in some cases, terrorists, mass murderers
are stopped by responsible people with firearms.
So on that basis alone, because it doesn't pass the purity test of these far left publications,
they gave it a negative review.
So this is the whole situation right now, where if you don't bow and scrape and grovel
and genuflect to all these left-wing ideologues, these left-wing dogmas, you're not even going
to get a fair hearing on any kind of art, on any kind of movie, and that's fundamentally
bad for society because it encourages people to make boring crap that's not driven by plot,
but driven by, again, forning obsequiousness to these left-wing dogmas.
That's always going to produce boring, stale, semi-predictable content, and that's exactly
what's starting to happen now in the rest of Hollywood, which is why their box office
income has plummeted.
We've seen this figures.
It's what is it?
They had the worst summer last year for about 10, 15 years, even though the more people
going to the movies, because the population is far greater than it was 15 years ago,
but still income is down because people are turning away from this social justice indoctrination.
We also see that with the NFL, of course, people are turning away from that.
The polls on the NFL said that people were turning off because they don't want politics
in their sports.
I mean, that's why when Vince McMahon launched the alternative to the NFL, the XFL, he made
a point of saying, we're not going to have politics constantly inserted, injected into
everything.
If you're sick of it, the left-wing intelligentsia is not sick of it, and that's why they're
panning Clint Eastwood's movie because he dares to portray authentic Americana.

We have found an extraordinary, new, natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal
breathing.
This is pollen block.
In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms, like running nose, itchy
watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
Studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials, now we are introducing
the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets at the first sign
of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to
help alleviate seasonal distress.
Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now at infowarslife.com

boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
Now, frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but
it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae, and I came

Red pill, now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
You found it, the tip of the spear.
It is the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
We're live, it is the Alex Jones Show, Miloenopolis is coming up in the third and fourth hours,
so we're sure to stay tuned for that, but let's recap what we started the show with,
which is this top story, which is also on the Drudge Report, it is, kill the NRA sign
appears on billboard in Louisville, Kentucky.
This sign has been up since Friday, at least since Friday, it was still up as of yesterday
evening, or Monday evening, I believe, that's right, yesterday evening, kill the NRA, resist
45, obviously a reference to the resistance movement against President Trump.
This is a sign of the divisive, violent rhetoric that is plaguing the political discourse right
now.
That was just days after our big exclusive story about the Facebook group.
I think the name of the group was milkshakes for the Republican Party, which was by the
way removed by Facebook, days later, they were slow off the starting gun again on that.
But on that Facebook page, we featured the quotes, absolutely shocking.
This is the quote from the Facebook page on this far left group, after the Florida shooting.
It said, quote, dear crazed shooters, the GOP has frequent baseball practice.
You really want to be remembered.
That's how you do it, signed Americans tired of our politicians bathing in the blood of
the innocent for a few million dollars from the terrorist organization NRA.
That was literally put out as a public post on Facebook, calling the NRA a terrorist group,
decrying politicians bathing in the blood of the innocent while calling for terrorist
attacks and bloody shootings.
Now, do they not get the irony there?
There was another post on this Facebook page, which read, quote, you remember the shooting
at the Republican baseball game.
Of course, a reference to the James T. Hodgkinson attempted massacre, which thankfully claimed
no lives.
Obviously, severely injured Congressman Scalese, the post went on to say, one of those should
happen every week until those NRA funded SOBs do something about this.
So they're openly calling for politically motivated terrorist attacks in response to
this horrific shooting.
Now, of course, we've got CNN, we've got MSNBC, using these kids as propaganda tools.
Again, their favorite tactic is to use children as cheerleaders, as dog whistles for their
anti-gun, anti-second amendment message.
Oh, by the way, one of the kids involved in this school shooting, one of the survivors
is a fan of info wars, follows me on Twitter is pro second amendment.
You don't see him on CNN, do you?
No, they've only picked the students who are anti-gun.
Of course, in Florida, you're going to get a lot of people who are growing up in conservative
families who understand and cherish the second amendment.
Those kids, those survivors aren't on CNN.
Instead we've got this headline out of CNN, Parkland students show why 16 year olds should
be able to vote.
They're literally calling for 16, I mean, when I was 16, I literally thought communism
was fantastic, that capitalism was to blame for all the ills in the world.
I was stupid.
I was naive.
Who knows anything about anything when they're 16 years old?
Now you've got some of these kids who are being put up on television.
Some of these videos that we've embedded in this article upon info wars.com, there's an
article about this where they're practicing lines, they're being told by people off
camera what to say in one case.
That's what it looks like.
Now that's not to take away from the absolute horror of the experience that these kids went
through, but they are being used to push a political message in the aftermath of this.
Now CNN is calling on basically the law to be changed and 16 year olds being given the
right to vote.
It says the real adults in the room, or the youth from Parkland, Florida, again, excluding
the youth who actually support the Second Amendment, nobody wants to speak to them, nobody wants
them on camera, do they?
Because that wouldn't jive, would it?
That wouldn't fit their message.
Continues who are speaking out about the need for meaningful gun control laws.
They are proving that civic engagement among young people can make a difference.
The ironic part, they can't even vote yet.
It goes on to say several municipalities in the United States allow 16 and 17 year olds
to vote in local elections.
So there's a good tweet in response to this which said basically, if your ideas are dependent
on needing 16 year olds to vote for them, maybe they aren't good ideas.
What in the heck does any 16 year old know about anything, much less these complex nuanced
political debates?
That's not to say that we shouldn't encourage young people to get involved in the political
process, but to give 16 year olds the vote.
I mean, come on.
What's next?
12 year olds, maybe 10 year olds?
Isn't it a coincidence that they want to give people a vote because they're the most
easily swayed by propaganda because at such a young age, you tend to take the most simplistic
explanation of anything and then that becomes your own political dogma.
You grow up, you become an actual adult and realize that things are just a little bit
more complicated than that, which is why we tend to have the voting age a little bit older.
But now CNN is calling on 16 and 17 year olds to be able to vote in elections just by coincidence
because they're probably going to vote in slightly larger numbers for all the policies
that CNN would support, including of course, restrictive gun control measures.
Now as another example of this, the divisive rhetoric that we're seeing, this is on my
Twitter.
If you go on there and scroll down a little bit, this will pop up, it's a tweet by somebody
called Wakanda Flockerflame, a reference again to the Black Panther movie.
This guy is literally wearing a communist hammer and sickle t-shirt.
Here we have an irony of a guy wearing a t-shirt that symbolizes mass murder and he's lecturing
everyone else about mass murder.
The tweet says this, this has not just some random, this got tweeted, re-tweeted 12.3
thousand times.
It got 41,000 likes on Twitter in the past two days.
You see it up on screen now for TV viewers.
It says, I've been to public high school and black and Latin students kids bought guns
and knives to school every day.
Oh, great.
And no one ever got shot or stabbed.
Yeah, because there's literally no shootings or stabbings by black kids or Latino kids.
That never happens in America.
They don't form a significant part of violent crime statistics.
That's not happening.
And this guy went to school with kids who brought guns and knives in every day.
And they were well-behaved children.
Nothing ever went wrong.
He finishes by saying, kids aren't the problem, white kids are.
So again, every single event, they seize on it to push this divisive identity politics,
this obsession with racism.
Now, Slate, of all publications, Slate, which is a left-wing publication, did a study into
mass shooters.
They found that the demographics on ethnicity of mass shooters correlate almost exactly
with the demographics of the American population.
So the amount of white shooters correlates almost directly, in fact, white people are
slightly underrepresented in mass shootings per head as part of the population, the general
population, because you've got some Hispanic shooters, some black shooters.
It tends to correlate with population demographics.
So this entire narrative that the only people who carry out mass shootings are white kids,
yes, the majority are white kids, because white people are the majority in the United
States.
Slate proved it.
This is not Newsmax, this is not WorldNet Daily, this is not Breitbart, this is not Infowars,
this is a left-wing publication.
They proved that demographics correlated with mass shootings.
So again, completely wrong, completely insane, completely unhinged to say the problem is
white kids, even more unhinged to say, oh, my friends bought in knives and guns to school
every day, they were black, they were Latina, we didn't have any problems.
Absolutely incredible, but this is the rhetoric we're seeing in the aftermath of the Parkland
massacre.
We're also seeing Jim Carrey in another bizarre tweet that he came out with, headline sick,
Jim Carrey tweets to teen survivor, graphic cartoon of school massacre with anti-Trump
message.
This is a Gateway Pundit article, actor comedian Jim Carrey created an anti-Trump work of art
showing bloody dead bodies of dead students killed in the Parkland Florida school massacre
and tweeted it to a teen student survivor of the attack.
Now this cartoon basically shows Trump on the golf course pitching golf balls on a silhouette,
in a silhouette before a fairway, littered with bloody bodies of children.
Trump is shown yelling, what's wrong with these kids?
Didn't they hear me yell for so he's literally blaming directly Donald Trump for the Florida
school massacre.
By the way, number of mass shootings during Obama's turn 41, number of shootings blamed
on Obama, zero, but Trump's at fault for the Florida massacre, we'll be back to talk more
about it.
Let's go show live.

Now, CNN, MSNBC and the usual suspects are trying to turn this Florida school shooting
into basically a baseball bat to beat Trump over the head with.
We had the massive scandal over the weekend, if you remember, Trump visiting some of the
victims in hospital, and you know what he did?
You know what that evil son of a gun did?
He actually smiled on camera.
Now, let's not talk about the fact that in these pictures, the rest of the family and
the victim, the girl who's in the hospital bed recovering, they've also got beaming smiles
from ear to ear.
No, Trump's bad because he's doing exactly the same thing in the photograph as the victim
and as the family members of the victim are doing.
They tried to pin that on him as well.
Literally, the derangement has reached levels on parallel.
We've got them worshiping North Korean dictators, people involved in that brutal, horrific regime.
Worshiping them for smiling at the Winter Olympics, they're great.
They literally have hundreds of thousands of political dissidents in incarceration camps
who get tortured to death.
But she's great because she smiled and she gave Mike Pence the side eye and she really
owned him.
The media is worshiping her, meanwhile, Trump smiles in a hospital photo with the rest of
the family members and the victim smiling, but he's bad.
Absolutely incredible double standard.
They see some of the pictures.
The staff members are all smiling, trying to raise everyone's spirits in what must be
a horrible, horrible time, but no, Trump's bad for doing that.
Then you have the obvious political narrative going against Trump, blaming him for the massacre.
Now we have this article from Daily Caller, hero coach who laid down his life protecting
students was a Trump supporter.
One of the heroes who lost his life during the Florida school shooting this week appears
to have been a Trump supporter.
These are the Facebook likes of the late football coach, Aaron Fyce, who died using his body
as a human shield to protect students from flying bullets at Stoneman Douglas High School.
So they went through his Facebook likes.
It was all Donald Trump.
It was anti-socialist stuff.
It was spiky memes against socialism, all kinds of good stuff.
Again, they circled his likes.
He likes Ben Shapiro, a bunch of different conservative websites.
He likes Donald J. Trump.
So this effort to pin this on Trump is completely asinine.
As I said in the previous segment, one of the survivors, one of the victims of this attack,
who took some of the iconic photographs of them hiding under the desks, hiding under
the tables, hiding under the chairs, he's an Infowars fan, huge Infowars fan.
I was talking to him on Twitter.
So some of the victims were Trump supporters.
Some of them were Trump haters.
It doesn't matter.
Why are you trying to politicize this by blaming Trump when literally the hero who
threw himself in front of the victims was a Trump supporter?
Now, if this massacre was motivated by somebody's support for Trump, which doesn't appear to
be the case.
It appears to have been motivated by the fact that this guy was a nihilistic loser.
Then yeah, that may have been part of the discussion, but it wasn't.
I mean, there was an attempted terrorist attack before Christmas, which we reported on, where
it was a Muslim convert who was planning to shoot up Pier 39 in San Francisco and murder
a bunch of people.
He was a supporter of Antifa.
He was a Muslim convert.
It was obviously a politically motivated attack.
Thankfully, it was stopped.
But again, if it's politically motivated, then yes, it's right to talk about it and
to talk about the environment that we're in right now.
But these school shootings, obviously the vast majority of them are just carried out
by nihilistic loner losers who've had terrible parenting, terrible backgrounds, and that's
what we need to address in society, the atomization of these young people.
You can't just pin it on Donald Trump because you've got Trump derangement syndrome like
Jim Carrey.
I mean, let's flash back to that Gateway Pundit headline.
Jim Carrey tweets to teen survivor graphic cartoon of school massacre with anti-Trump
message.
So he's literally scrawled this cartoon in his fever and it shows Trump pitching a golf
ball with the golf green littered with dead bodies of children.
Absolutely incredible.
He added the quote, what's wrong with these kids?
Didn't they hear me yell four?
Again, there were 41 mass shootings during Barack Obama's presidential term.
How many was he blamed for?
By people like Jim Carrey, by people on the left, zero.
The first major mass shooting after, of course, the Las Vegas massacre, which they also tried
to blame on Trump, by the way, even though most of the victims would have been Trump
supporters typically at a country music rock concert, again, immediately their Trump derangement
syndrome takes hold literally everything, every mass casualty event, everything they
have to pin on him because they need to tie it into their derangement.
Meanwhile, some of the victims, some of the survivors were Trump supporters.
So you're disrespecting those people when you do that.
But again, this is the divisive environment that we live in and it's reached levels of
hysteria that we haven't seen.
I've certainly never seen in my entire history of covering news, basically, where we got
to the point where far left writers at the root are calling on black people to start
barking at white people and intimidating women in elevators.
For what reason?
For what reason do I ask?
We're supposed to be coming together as a society in these difficult times.
These people constantly driving wedges over and over again.
And the far right appreciates that too.
They need each other.
They riff off of each other.
So the hysteria on the fringes continues to build because it benefits both sides.
Absolutely incredible.
Switching gears for a moment now, this is out of the Washington Post and Donald Trump tweeted
about this this morning.
Trump accuser keeps telling her story, hoping someone will finally listen.
This is the same woman who was accused Donald Trump of sexually harassing her over and over
again.
People are listening.
She's been on countless television shows.
She's got the front page headline in the Washington Post.
Trump completely denies it.
He tweeted this morning, a woman I don't know, and to the best of my knowledge never
met, is on the front page of the fake news Washington Post saying, I kissed her for two
minutes in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago.
Never happened.
Who would do this in a public space with live security?
Cameras running.
So Trump's calling it another false accusation.
The Washington Post is running with a headline that nobody's listening to this woman.
She's literally, she was on Megan Kelly's show for like half an hour in December talking
about this.
She's been in the Washington Post.
She's been in numerous other publications.
People are listening.
It just seems like they're not believing.
And that's the problem we have here.
Remember, this woman who claims that Trump kissed her, that he accosted her at Trump
Tower, went on Megan Kelly's show and said, characterise Trump asking for her phone number
as sexual harassment.
Remember that?
So again, you've got this whole Me Too movement, which has been again completely politicised,
completely hijacked by people on the far left, to demean Donald Trump once again, tying
every single thing into their Trump derangement syndrome.
Where their Trump should address this?
Who knows?
Maybe that's a mistake, but people aren't going to tell him what to tweet as we've found
out by now.
But this is a woman who's got relentless, saturation media coverage, and yet she's
on the front page of the Washington Post saying, no one's listening.
People are listening.
People aren't believing.
And that seems to be the problem with these relentless sexual assault accusations against
Donald Trump.
We'll be back after the break.
This is the Alex Cherim Show Live breaking news at infowars.com.
Don't go away.

We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
It is Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones coming up in the third and fourth hours.
We have the one and only Milo Unopolis for now, we'll head back into the news.
I was talking about this story before the break, again, this accuser, this Trump accuser
claiming that he, God forbid, asked for her phone number, the horror, is now claiming
that Trump kissed her for two minutes, accosted her in Trump Tower, trumps up on Twitter denying
it.
Now, I flash back to this story, which we had in December, where Bill O'Reilly was
predicting a new sexual assault claim or a slew of sexual assault claims against Trump.
They tried to roll into this whole me too crescendo, trying to scalp Donald Trump with
that narrative.
It doesn't appear as though they've been successful because they just keep recycling
the same stories over and over again.
But because back in December, you see the headline there, huge fake sexual assault claim
against Trump coming in January.
That didn't happen.
They just recycled what we already knew about or heard about.
Will they try this again?
Will they come out with new victims claiming that they were assaulted or accosted by Donald
Trump with no evidence whatsoever to pack it up?
It remains to be seen, but Trump is tweeting about it again this morning.
Also, he's tweeting about Russian collusion once again, headline, Trump Tweetstorm, President
Trump takes on Obama for not taking action against Russian election interference.
President Trump cut loose on Twitter again Tuesday morning.
The Republican president went off on Barack Obama.
The Democratic Party in the far less Russia collusion hopes, which again, is completely
boring at this point.
They've indicted another lawyer today who's tangentially implicated with Manafort.
It's completely boring.
They've got nothing whatsoever on Trump, nothing directly as it obtains the collusion
on his campaign.
So the drumbeat continues from day to day today.
And now Trump is addressing it on Twitter.
He says, I've been much tougher on Russia than Obama.
Just look at the facts, total fake news.
He went on to say, to hit former President Obama for his famous quote on election integrity
before the election, when Barack Obama thought Hillary Clinton would win.
Remember that when Hillary came out and said, oh, Trump's going to say that it was rigged
when I win.
And of course, she was the one that came out and said it was rigged when she lost.
Trump said, quote, there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you
could even rig America's elections.
He's quoting Obama, of course, here.
There's no evidence that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time.
So I invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.
That is Trump in a tweet this morning, quoting what Obama said, basically suggesting people
who claim American elections are rigged are completely stupid, of course, that's exactly
what they claimed when they lost.
Trump went on to say, the President Obama quote just before the election, that's because
he thought crooked Hillary was going to win, and then he didn't want to rock the boat.
When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse
became the narrative of the Dems.
So again, he's bashing Obama, he's bashing Hillary Clinton on the fact that they relentlessly
talked about this rigging of elections, they lost, and it was them complaining about election
being rigged, and then he had the anti-Trump riots and everything after that.
We also have, on the subject of Russian collusion, CNN and MSNBC helped Russia sow discord by
promoting fake anti-Trump rally.
And who showed up at one of these Russian operated rallies?
Well, it was none other than the odious blob, Michael Moore.
Fox News reports Michael Moore participated in anti-Trump rally, allegedly organized
by Russians.
The filmmaker who was long accused, President Trump, of colluding with the Russians, posted
videos and pictures of himself, and they're actually in this article, participating in
a protest in Manhattan that was allegedly organized by Russians in November 2016.
So he was virtue signaling about how Trump was not responding to this protest, about
how Trump was in bed with the Russians, meanwhile, the Russians were literally behind this protest
at which Michael Moore was an attendee, absolutely incredible.
As the only Russian collusion it appears was between elements of the anti-Trump resistance,
of course, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, who were more closely tied to Russia than
anyone in the Trump campaign.
No evidence has come out to prove anything otherwise, thus far we'll be back.
This is out the Alexandria Live, don't go away.
Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that
if you want proven studies and documentation, let me speak for hours, this is on the files

Now, I'm talking about Trump derangement syndrome.
Of course, Jennifer Lawrence came out a few months ago
and basically said that the hurricanes
that were happening over that time period,
September to October,
were the result of God's wrath
because Americans voted for Donald Trump.
Yes, she literally said that.
Well, now she's taking a break from acting,
which of course is nothing to do with the fact
that her last movie was a complete flop, honestly.
To quote, fix our democracy.
This is a headline out of Breitbart.
Jennifer Lawrence taking a break from acting
to fix our democracy.
Hollywood A-listed Jennifer Lawrence says
she's taking a sabbatical from acting
so she can help fix our democracy.
She's gonna single-handedly fix the democracy
that brought a president to power
by an electoral college win completely in line
with how democracy works,
but she's gonna fix it even though it's not broken.
She's gonna fix it.
She's the expert, she's Jennifer Lawrence.
I mean, come on.
She thinks God sends hurricanes to punish Trump voters.
She's the expert.
She's the credible party in this equation.
She said, quote, I'm going to take the next year off.
And again, that's nothing to do with the fact
that she's a failed actor,
whose movies continue to flop over and over again,
honestly, it's nothing to do with that.
So she's gonna take a year off
explaining how she will work
with a self-described anti-corruption nonprofit
to again fix America's democracy, which isn't broken.
To begin with, she says, quote,
I'm going to be working with this organization
as part of represent.us,
trying to get young people engaged politically
on a local level.
So in other words, she's trying to indoctrinate young people
to imbibe in her Trump derangement syndrome.
She continued by saying
it doesn't have anything to do with partisan politics.
And you can believe that.
It's just anti-corruption
and stuff trying to pass state-by-state laws
that can help prevent corruption, fix our democracy.
Now, this is interesting.
This is a quote from further on in the article.
She said, I want to get a farm.
I want to be like milking goats.
Now, I think those are the words of another celebrity
who has been broken by Donald Trump.
Much in the similar vein as Eminem, of course,
who had a whining hissy fit about the fact
that Trump refused to respond to him.
Now, Jennifer Lawrence is so traumatized by Trump.
She's basically quitting acting for at least a year.
And she's going to work on a farm.
She's going to milk goats.
Sounds like she's been broken by Donald Trump, doesn't it?
Another hysterical celebrity.
Let's talk about this, though,
because this is an absolutely shocking video
which we're going to play here in a moment.
Now, this arose out of the LeBron James Laura Ingram controversy.
Of course, LeBron James, a basketball player,
came out and said, the number one job in America,
the appointed person is someone
who doesn't understand the people.
He's talking about Donald Trump, the arch criminal,
the commander in evil.
The athlete said he added
that some of the president's comments are laughable and scary.
So Laura Ingram of Fox News responded to his comments,
calling LeBron James barely intelligible
and ungrammatical on her Fox News show.
She continued, quote,
it's always unwise to seek political advice
from someone who gets paid $100 million a year
to bounce a ball.
Keep the political comments to yourselves.
Shut up and dribble.
So Laura Ingram had the nerve
to face up, to strike back against LeBron James
because he strayed into the political arena.
And then what happened is this delist actor
who has basically not even been in anything
known by anyone since like 2011.
I didn't even know who he was.
So Michael Rappaport attacking Laura Ingram.
These are some of the most vile, actual misogynistic comments
you will ever hear in mainstream politics.
Now, I've said it over and over again.
They reserve their most hateful vitriol,
their most sexist hateful misogyny for conservative women.
You've heard all the absolutely disgusting slurs
against Ann Coulter, which I can barely even talk about
because they're full of C words and F words.
Now, Michael Rappaport, this nobody actor,
has gone on an absolute unhinged run against Laura Ingram
because she dared call out LeBron James for his comments.
Let's go to this heavily censored clip
because it's full of profanity. Here's the clip.
I'm apologizing in advance.
I know this is going to offend some women,
but I had to do it.
This is for Laura Ingram, the cock-eyed Fox News commentator
with the Bobby Brown drawl who said that K.D. and LeBron James
should just shut up and dribble.
No, cluckhead. You shut up and dribble.
These nuts.
You mayonnaise eating, Melba toast,
no seasoning on your chicken cracker.
Your butt is so flat that when you stand up,
you can see your entire asshole.
I'm sorry, ladies. I warned you at the top.
You little stunt you.
Your Lord and Savior, Donald Trump,
wouldn't even grab you by the pussy.
And if he did, he probably get his fingers caught in a mousetrap.
You went to college, Laura, and you're proud of that.
And what do you got to show for it?
A mouth full of fake teeth, a face full of Botox
and some dry-ass hair extensions,
and you still never got f***ed right.
Your little jump off, shut up and dribble.
F*** out of here.
That is D-list actor who nobody's ever heard of,
Michael Rappaport, responding to Laura Ingram.
Absolutely vile, vicious, profane-filled run
against Laura Ingram, attacking her on her appearance.
Of course, when Trump said that Rosie O'Donnell was fat,
he was terrible when he said that Megan Kelly
was bleeding out of her wherever.
It was literally the worst thing on Earth.
This guy can get up and say far, far worst things
about Laura Ingram.
And of course, he's praised, he's worshipped,
he's got 10,000 retweets.
Everybody loves him now.
Isn't it ironic, given this hateful, profane-filled run
against women, that Michael Rappaport was dumped by his ex-girlfriend
and was charged with aggravated harassment because
after she dumped him, he started going insane
and stalking her, calling her up 200 times,
banging on her window.
She had to get restraining order.
He got charged with aggravated assault.
That's his attitude towards women.
So is it any surprise that this complete creep,
this piece of crap gets up there on Twitter
and goes on the most unhinged, vile,
vicious, misogynistic run against Laura Ingram?
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst of it is he's worshipped by the left
amidst this whole hashtag me too movement
where everybody believes the victim,
everybody has to be respectful, very careful around women.
He does the exact opposite.
He goes on this unhinged, vile run.
He's worshipped, he's adored.
Again, the left's double standard in evidence
over and over again.
And he's a natural harasser of women.
What a piece of crap.

Before the break, I was talking about this headline,
Michael Rappaport attacks Laura Ingram over LeBron comments,
dribble these nuts,
and then he calls her a cuss word.
Basically, this D-list nobody engaged in a vile vitriolic
hateful rant against women.
He's talking about her being a cracker.
He's talking about her physical appearance.
Absolutely disgusting, and it's the tone of voice.
It's the look across his face.
Looks like an absolute deranged nutcase
when he's engaged in this rant.
Funny thing is about this, Michael Rappaport,
the D-list actor who nobody knows or cares about,
which is why he needs to do this in the first place,
is an actual sexual harasser of women.
Oh, isn't that going, how many times have we seen this?
Where these virtue signallers,
the most aggressive virtue signallers about me too,
about feminism, about respecting women.
In every case, turn out to be sexual harassers of women.
Overcompensation much, do you think?
There's a headline about this guy,
whose ex-girlfriend dumped him.
The headline is, I'm not Rappaport's, but Lily X's persists.
Lily's ex persists.
It talks about his relationship with his ex-girlfriend,
which the article, and I think this is a New York post,
says, took a scary turn last month.
Now, this is a while back, but again, it shows the hypocrisy here.
Rappaport, who was featured in Mighty Aphrodite
and Beautiful Girls, again, never heard of those,
don't know what they are, was dating Taylor for months.
So he was dating this Lily Taylor woman.
Then it says, the diminutive 30-year-old is best known
for her roles in Mystic Pizza and I Shot Andy Warhol.
So they were frequently seen around New York.
They were dating.
Eventually, Taylor, the girl, wanted out of the relationship.
But after she broke up with the actor, he continued to haunt her.
New York City police confirm that Rappaport was arrested May 18.
The victim, Lily Taylor, made a report May 17,
saying that the suspect repeatedly telephoned her,
alarmed her, annoyed her, and banged on her apartment window.
What a creep! What a piece of crap!
According to police officer Kathy Kelly,
he banged on her apartment window,
he was calling her, telephoning her, repeatedly stalking her,
after she dumped him.
Quote, he was subsequently arrested by the sixth squad
and charged with two counts of aggravated harassment.
So you have a vile nobody who's literally a harasser of women
charged with aggravated harassment,
getting up there and spewing the most vile invective
against Laura Ingram.
Because Laura Ingram dared tell LeBron James
to shut up with his Trump derangement syndrome.
She didn't engage in any kind of attack based on his appearance
or his identity or his skin colour.
She attacked his argument.
This creep, this piece of crap that nobody's ever heard of
or cares about, Michael Rappaport,
attacked to Laura Ingram's appearance.
And we all joke about feminists being fat or whatever.
It's banter, it's tonguing cheek, okay?
There's a level that you get to
where it just becomes a little bit too intense,
a little bit vile, a little bit creepy.
And he passed that red line as you heard in that clip.
Let's go to that video clip again of this nobody,
Michael Rappaport, viciously attacking Laura Ingram.
Not on her argument, but on her appearance
and the fact that she's a woman. Let's go to the clip.
I'm apologizing in advance.
I know this is going to offend some women,
but I had to do it.
This is for Laura Ingram,
the cock-eyed Fox News commentator
with the Bobby Brown draw,
who said that K.D. and LeBron James
should just shut up and dribble.
No, Cluckhead, you shut up and dribble.
These nuts.
You mayonnaise eating,
Melba toast, no seasoning
on your chicken cracker.
Your butt is so flat that when you stand up,
you can see your entire asshole.
I'm sorry, ladies. I warned you at the top.
You little stunt you.
Your lord and savior, Donald Trump,
wouldn't even grab you by the p***y.
And if he did, he'd probably get his fingers caught
in a mousetrap.
You went to college, Laura, and you're proud of that.
And what have you got to show for it?
A mouth full of fake teeth, a face full of Botox
and some dry-ass hair extensions,
and you still never got f***ed right.
Your little jump off, shut up and dribble.
The f*** out of here.
What kind of individual
engages, that's like a minute-long
invective, vicious rant
about her appearance, about the fact that she's
white. He's white.
He's racist on top of being sexist.
Absolutely disgraceful.
And of course, it turns out
that he actually, sexually
harassed a woman, was charged with two cases
of aggravated assault.
What a piece of crap.
What they're all worshiping in. All the same people
who talk about me too every single day
and to let blue in the face.
I'll love this guy.
What an absolute creep.
Moving on from that, talking about the divisive
climate in America right now, we have this story
up on infowars.com.
Of course, we had the NRA
banner hang of the billboard, which said
basically kill NRA members.
We had the Facebook group calling
on people to kill Republicans as a revenge
for the Florida high school attack.
Now I have this video up on infowars.com.
Native American gets beat down
after assaulting Trump voter.
This is a video up on infowars.com.
A self-described Native American guy
got his butt handed to him after he
assaulted a Trump supporter.
So he basically got triggered by the fact
that one of the guys in the clip was
wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
Which he said, quote,
that effing hat caused genocide.
It was unclear what genocide
he was referring to. The Native American
then knocked the hat off the camera
man's friend who promptly defended himself
as a shock of the Native American
who whined what the eff
as he took a barrage of fists.
So he was so shocked that this guy
who he was assaulting
actually fought back.
The article continues, it appears
that Trump derangement syndrome is now leading
to Popeye syndrome in which wimps
think they're invincible and capable of
starting confrontations despite never taking a punch
to the face. And you look at this clip
and again, it's another odious little blob
who thinks he's a tough guy.
Quickly
proven otherwise. But again,
Trump supporters getting attacked on the streets
simply for wearing a
MAGA hat. And yet the entire narrative
in the news media
again is that all the hate, all the resentment
is being directed from Trump supporters
towards the left. When it's all going
in the opposite direction
most of the hate crimes, a significant portion
of the hate crimes that they blame
on, you know, the Trump era
have been completely proven
to be false in many cases.
We have these incidents on a
weekly basis almost more
in some cases. No media
attention whatsoever. It'll get on YouTube
it'll get a few thousand views
it won't go beyond that. This is the climate
we're living in.
Now talking about
the sexual harassment of women, of course
the actual problem, the actual virulent
problem with the sexual harassment of women
which is migrants coming
into Europe and the West in general
and treating women as second-class citizens
continues not only to get very
little media attention, but to be openly
decried by the left when
anyone points it out.
This headline is up on Breitbart.com
activists against migrant violence towards
women protest at Berlin film
festival.
This 120 dB group has been formed
in Germany to protest against
migrant violence, of course violent crime through the
roof in Germany after the importation of
almost two million, I think it was
by the end of it Muslim migrants continues
to happen.
Now activists from the anti-migrant violence women's movement
120 dB stormed a panel
on harassment and violence against women in
film and television industry
Berlin film festival holding a banner
reading The Voice of Forgotten
Women.
And guess what happened when they got
up on the stage and tried to protest
against the assault of women
at this Berlin film
festival event. We'll tell you what happened
after the break. This is the Alex Jones
show live breaking news at
infowars.com. We'll be back.

by the same media

all day long. They got up in front of this Berlin
film film festival
held up a banner which said the voice of
forgotten women.
In reference to the fact that almost on a weekly
basis, if not more women
are being sexually harassed. Women
are being raped. In some cases
women are being murdered.
The violent crime level has exploded
since they imported
Muslim migrants who treat women as second
class citizens. These brave women
are trying to draw attention to that
in opposition to feminists in Germany
who literally after the cologne mass
molestation of women, which involved
thousands of victims, went to
the local migrants into the day
after and handed out roses.
They sided with the actual
perpetrators. In some cases
these brave women are standing up
for the actual victims.
And guess what happened?
The female activists were promptly shouted
at and labeled Nazis.
Yeah, you're a Nazi
if you recognize the true threat to women
based on the actual crime stats
released by the government and then draw
attention to it. That makes you a Nazi.
So they shouted
Nazi at them. They chanted Nazis out
while the women bravely held
their own, held their banner
with a sign showing a picture of
11-year-old Stockholm terror victim
Eber Akerland and we're going to have more on that
soon as well.
The article goes on to say
actress Jasmine Tabatabi who sat on the panel
labeled the women Nazis saying
it was probably neo-Nazis who thought
they had to blow up the program.
I do not know if it really makes sense to debate
with such people. Yeah, don't debate
with them. Don't interact. Don't
actually give them a platform or actually
let them engage them in a conversation
because we can't have that, can we?
Just label them Nazis
and say they have no argument. Even though
you can't address their argument, you just throw
ad homonyms at them. That's disgusting.
Breitbartlanden spoke exclusively
with 120 dB activist
Freyja from Dresden
who said the 120 dB movement is there
to draw attention to the imported
sexual violence against European women
committed by mostly Muslim
immigrants.
Yeah, they even utter that thought crime.
We did not and never will negate
that there are other forms of violence against women.
So they're not saying that this is the sole
problem. They're just saying this is a big
part of it. Why are you literally
shouting us down as Nazis
simply because we're trying to draw attention
to it. Case after case of molestation,
rape of women
in Germany committed by
these migrants. Freyja called the panel
hypocritical saying you can damage anyone's
reputation by stating that he raped you with his eyes
or complimented you in an appropriate way.
But soon as you mention
that there's been a significant increase in sexual violence
of extraordinary brutality against
women that correlates with the
uncontrolled mass immigration from Muslim countries,
you get shut down by the
media and left-wing activists calling you a Nazi
and a fascist for simply
stating facts and telling the truth.
Gee, it's almost like
all those virtue signals
on the left don't actually care
about women and just care
about exploiting
hyped-up sexual harassment of women
in the case of the Me Too movement
to pursue their own
political agenda, which is about
the obtain of power.
Fundamentally, this is about
overthrowing the patriarchy in their own words.
Meanwhile,
you've got actual cases of sexual harassment
exploding not only in Germany
in other countries in Europe.
These women have formed a group to draw attention
to it and they're getting attacked like never
before.
Given that, is it any surprise
that this next headline tells us
about the AFD becoming
the second strongest party
in Germany?
German far-right AFD surpasses
social democrats to become second strongest party.
The populist far-right
AFD party has garnered record high support
latest polling shows.
For the first time, the anti-immigrant party
has become more popular than the social
democrat. Now, of course
they had the election in Germany
what was it a couple of months ago now.
The social democrats had to
form this unshakey alliance
with Angela Merkel's party. It took them weeks
and weeks to try and figure it out.
AFD came in third. They got about 12%
of the votes.
An excellent result all around.
Now they're the second most popular party.
So they're basically
in front of Germany's
version of the democrats.
I mean, that's how bad it is in Germany now
with the problems that have come as a result
of this migrant wave. That this party
demonized as far
right, and let's not deny that there are
some elements within it that are fringe
that are extremists that are far right.
But even so, they got
12% of the vote. They're now up to
16. They're more popular
than Germany's second party
in the space of about two months alone.
What does that tell you about
the situation in Germany?
We also have Italy's election hopeful
Salvini wants to deport
500,000 migrants.
We also have an election in Italy
next month in March.
Now in Italy,
Berlusconi's Conservative Party and
the Northern League, which is another
Conservative right-wing party, look like
they're going to win and form a coalition.
The leader of Italy's Northern League party,
Matteo Salvini, said
he wants to deport half a million migrants
within five years.
Gee, I wonder why that
is appealing to the Italian people right now,
given how their port towns
are being completely overrun by these
boats coming in from Libya.
So that's his platform.
He wants to deport 500,000 migrants
to try and get the situation back under control
in Italy.
And he's likely to win and form a centre-right
coalition with Berlusconi's
Forza Italia Party
in the Italian elections on
March 4th.
So across Europe, in every single country
across Sweden in the next segment,
there's a huge backlash for these
disastrous policies in relation to
the migrant crisis that we've seen over the past
two years. We'll be back to talk more about it
on the Alex Jones Show Live, infowalls.com.

We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
News, analysis, reports.
It's the Alex Jones show.
And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
We're live.
It is the Alex Jones show.
We're going to go to the one and only Milo
Yiannopoulos here in a minute.
I just want to finish off on a couple
of news headlines here.
In relation to what's happening in Europe,
of course, we had the story
about the election hopeful Salvini.
He is the leader of the Northern League
centre-right party in Italy.
Looks like they're going to win.
Looks like they're going to form a coalition
with Berlusconi's party.
He's promising to deport
500,000 migrants.
They're going to go to Germany,
getting up on stage at this Berlin film festival,
being shouted down, being called Nazis,
drawing attention to the violent crime,
to the sexual harassment now rampant
in that country.
Now in Sweden, my favourite country of all,
we have Sweden lorry attacker
who killed shoppers, wanted to build a caliphate.
An asylum seeker
who drove a lorry through crowds of shoppers
in Stockholm, killing five people,
has said he wanted to build a caliphate.
And I guess Sweden would have been
the place to do that.
It's funny that there are rumours that the ISIS leader,
al-Baghdadi, is actually
hiding out in Sweden
given that it would tend to be sympathetic
to his cause if you read the regular
stories coming out of that country.
But Rakhma Akulov,
who was a terrorist that ran down
and killed these people in the centre of Stockholm,
stole the bialorins
worth wildly through the Swedish capital city centre.
We all remember that horrible
story from April last year.
He's told a court that he wanted
Sweden to end its participation
in the fight against the caliphate
to stop sending its soldiers to war zones.
So he's trying to justify the attack.
But again, literally
saying that he wanted to quote, build a caliphate
according to Prophet Muhammad's
prophecies. And he thought he could do
that by literally tearing apart
little girls in the street.
Meanwhile, returning ISIS jihadists
are coming back into Sweden.
They're rolling out the red carpet,
giving them benefits, giving them housing,
even though there's a massive housing shortage
in Sweden. And now this,
the Council of Europe
slams crime wave Sweden for not
taking more migrants.
This is Breitbart.com. They're not doing enough.
They're literally obliterating
themselves, ruining their culture.
They hired a head.
This is my favourite story in the long one.
They hired as the head of their
cultural heritage board.
A guy who was a Muslim
migrant who admitted he'd read
nothing about Sweden's cultural heritage.
And in fact, in other interviews
showed that he wanted to
destroy Sweden's cultural heritage
because, of course, it was racist.
So now the Council of Europe
is calling on Sweden to import yet more
migrants, even as
we have these massive problems with mass
sexual assault, terrorist attacks.
But they're not doing enough. They're
literally obliterating their own country,
hiring people to head cultural heritage
boards that hate the culture
of Sweden. And even still,
that is not
enough. Absolutely incredible
situation in Europe. But now we're joined
by the one and only Milo
Unopolis there in studio.
Milo, good to speak to you. Hello,
pumpkin. How are you?
Now
let's get into this whole
you know, the banner
hang with the NRA. They're calling
for killing Republicans. We have the Facebook
group this week. Well, literally they were
like, yeah, we need to get revenge by
having more James T. Hodgkinson's
more crazed shooters
shooting Republican shooting conservatives.
Have you ever seen a time
where things of this divisive, this
hysterical, this unhinged?
No, and I don't think anybody has
for many decades, but it's a good
job that liberals are such terrible shots.
Steve Scalise, of course, lived
if it had been a Republican
shooting, he might not have done.
It's interesting, you know, liberals on the one hand
claim, you know, they're
saying that they want violent revolution.
They're going to start getting guns. They're going to resist Trump.
Well,
this is their undoing, really. I mean, on the one hand, they say
they want a sort of violent revolution. At the same time,
they're asking for gun control.
The undoing of these
liberal protesters is going to
come down to their reliance on words
over action. The left has been
policing language so long and so effectively.
The left has been controlling what we
can all say as a way of controlling what
we can all do for so long and with such
great results. I think that
they imagine words are now enough to
beat us. Words are now enough
to do the job. Well, they're not.
Left wingers seem to think they're going to be able to disarm
100 million Americans and
Second Amendment supporters, merely by saying
so, or by putting some innocent
looking children who have been coached with
Democrat Party talking points on television
instead of actually, you know,
taking to the... If the left really wants
to go, I think it's fairly obvious which way it's
going to go pretty quickly. As far as
the level of the fever pitch hysteria,
there's nothing more disgusting,
literally nothing
more disgusting than
people taking to the airways on the bodies,
the still warm bodies of dead children
to advocate for policies that would not work,
policies that would not stop
this happening in the future, policies that would
not stop any previous attack
from happening and which are really aimed
as everybody I think knows by now,
and well established
entrenching and enlarging and
ameliorating the power of the state
and reducing the ability of private
individuals to protect themselves against
tyranny and to protect themselves against
anything else and anybody else.
I mean, it's the most underprivileged
and vulnerable people of all
who need firearms. It's the women walking
through Detroit or Chicago
or St. Louis suburbs who would be
well served by having a pistol in their handbag
and possibly prevented from being attacked
and whatnot. It's gay people in
Orlando nightclubs
subjected to the horrors of imported
Islamism who would do well
to be carrying. If a couple of people had been
strapped up in pulse
in Orlando, the toll wouldn't have been
49, perhaps it would have been 2.
It is new
and it is incredible
the level of
divisive, vitriol and hatred. I can tell you
you and I are both visitors
in my case, literally in your case
professionally
to America and to the culture
wars, to the extraordinary
melting pot of horrors over here
and I can't speak for you, but
from my point of view as an impartial
observer, without
skin in the game, I'm not a Republican
I'm not whatever, it seems
to me unarguable
that
the entire range
and responsibility of the
horrors that are going through society are the result
of the progressive left provoking
and starting it.
Republicans in my experience
in this country on the whole just want to be left alone.
This is the land of liberty, this is where
people can pursue their individual good
in their own way, on their own
ranch in Montana, free
from imposition and free
from the prying eyes of government
and the interfering of teachers
of lawyers of all the other assorted
professional classes of busybodies
nannies, scolds and
school moms.
Most Republicans and certainly most Libertarians
just want to be left alone, but the left
just won't leave us and
they continue to inject themselves into our
private lives sociopathically in this case
by advocating
for more power for the state
and less power for the people in the wake
of a, well we shouldn't call it a tragedy
really, an attack by a nutto
in a school that had nothing to do with
gun legislation and would not have been
prevented had guns been
had the law been different in any way.
You see the Washington Post thing, amazing thing
the Washington Post published from
a former writer of 538,
Nate Silver's left wing data
driven blog and she said, I looked at the
evidence, I looked at the evidence
and I've
changed my mind, none of the gun control positions
proposed by Democrat
politicians, none of the things that the
celebrities and the
you know, the Catholic, whatever
the Democrat politicians who
hooled themselves onto Twitter to capitalize from these
tragedies, none of the stuff they propose
would have made a difference.
None of it would have worked. So why
they're doing it? Well it's quite obvious why they're doing it, isn't it? They're doing
it because
enlarging and empowering the
state and debilitating
private citizens is in the left's best
interests because when they control all of the
organs and all the institutions of civil society
they're best able to exercise control
over the public.
Which is why Milo, so this
is CNN today literally saying
we should lower the voting age
to 16 years old.
I believe there's a lot of things when I was 16
don't really believe
any of them now. I was straight when I was 16.
What did 16 year old Milo
believe for example? I was a
heterosexual
no, I was a heterosexual
centrist at 16
and why? Because my frontal lobes
weren't fully formed yet.
I wasn't actually a person yet.
I was 16 years old and I was
being buffeted around by
forces beyond my control
and by authorities I hadn't yet considered
whether or not I should question
parents, teachers,
social pressure from the playground.
I interviewed somebody on my show the other day.
It was a young girl
who was in her mid teens who was being told
by her teachers. She grew up in Berkeley
of all places, Berkeley, California.
She was being told by her teachers that questioning
their authority, questioning
what she was told in class represented
a violation of the school's
honour code. These are the kinds of pressures
that you have on you when you're 16.
You're not even fully
sexually developed at 16.
You're not capable of doing anything
at 16, particularly not
making decisions about the future.
I mean, we all know
why because people start left-wing
and when they get responsibilities, they get families,
they get mortgages and all the rest of it, they move
to the right because, of course, they do.
We all know why they want to lower the voting age. I would raise it to 30.
Alright, we'll be back with Milo
after the break. I want to talk to Milo
about Black Panther
and the new Clint Eastwood movie
which isn't getting as much praise,
shall we say, as Black Panther
and the old friend Wakanda.
We'll be back after the break on the Alex Jumps
M4Wars.com. Don't go.

Milo, we've got Wakanda, which is basically
an alt-right paradise, right?
It is!
People aren't getting their expectations met
when they go to see this film, I imagine, right?
Well, of course I went to it
with the precise expectation of seeing
black men in spandex and I was not disappointed.
I was like, you know, look,
obviously I'm never going to criticize a film
with lots of sexy, half-naked black men,
but what was amazing about it
was that the analysis that came from Breitbart
came from you, came from a writer at my own site,
was precisely correct.
The analysis of Black Panther was at Wakanda,
which set aside the silliness of Africa
having this glorious, glittering superpower presence
only for the absence of colonialism.
Yeah, yeah, it's funny, but set aside that
and look at the political dimensions of this country.
It was very clear, it's very obvious,
this is a nationalist, protectionist,
isolationist country with a leader who speaks
not entirely unlike Donald Trump,
and much more obvious and much more persuasive than that
is that Michael B. Jordan, villain,
is a social justice warrior.
He wants to rain down hellfire on quote, unquote,
the oppressor, on the white people.
It's very, very clear what the messaging is
and I don't think you need to look too deeply
or too hard to see it, it's all there for you.
This was confounding and confusing to me watching it
and I'd gone expecting to sort of enjoy it
at a superficial, trivial level,
you know, predictably, but have to sit through
and grit my teeth, you know, through the social justice nonsense.
But you know what, actually the message was completely confounding
in the opposite of what we all expected
and the media, of course, is very, very upset
that we have all noticed this, confused about our analysis
and is posting lots of pieces about how
Infowars Breitbart and Milo,
you see all those stories about how, you know,
Breitbart liked Black Panther, this is not okay.
There was a story that MSN, you know,
SF is the rap, all these, I think there were about 50 stories
all told with all of the aggregators and all the rest of it.
About 50 stories about the fact that I published
a positive review of Black Panther.
They so wanted us to be racist.
Well, I mean Milo, they expected it to be a gimme
that we would all hate it, we would all be triggered by it
and it would be an easy win for them, but quite the opposite happened.
But we did have this article I wanted to mention here out of the room
where they're literally calling, based off a scene in the movie
from what they say, for Black people to literally
start barking at white people.
Oh, it's your favourite thing.
White people who speak out of turn.
I don't know if it was barking.
It doesn't look like a parody.
It's in the movie, so if you haven't seen the movie yet,
I'm not spoiling any plot points by telling you
that when the sort of heroes in exile go to find a tribe
who was previously cast aside or whatever,
they go and they're searching for allies to sort of build up
their base before they launch an assault back on Wakanda.
And when they find these guys up north,
they happen to have a sort of typical movie white guy
who's a bumbling, awkward, terrified idiot,
which is of course how we are portrayed in advertising
and in the movies on TV these days.
And he tries to pipe up and they do actually bark at him.
It's something between, well, I went on to...
I went to YouTube and I listened to...
They describe it as maybe like an ape-like grunt.
Well, I went on to YouTube and listened to various animal sounds
to try to pin down exactly what animal it is.
And I'm still searching, so maybe in one of the breaks
I'll keep trying and I'll see if I can look at what it is.
But yes, I mean, it's sort of...
I wonder whether this is one of those things where they're kind of like,
we're going to put this in the movie to dare you to be racist about it.
So we're going to hand this to the lowest community,
because they think we actually are that racist.
They're the ones who are making the comparisons
between jungle beasts and people with a particular skin colour
and they think we're the bad guys and we're going to take the bait.
Well, we didn't.
And you know, instead we're focusing our attention, as you have been,
on brilliant storytelling from conservative movie makers like Clint Eastwood,
who is actually practising what the rest of us preach
and going out there and making movies that reflect our values.
And when they make a good movie and it happens to black people in it,
we'll say great.
OK, Milo is going to take over the reins in the next segment.
I've been Paul Joseph Watson, breaking news at infowars.com.
Don't go away, Milo. We'll be back.
I'm so excited.
The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle,
two-month servings filled to the brim,
filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic,
that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
And I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers.
Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have
to even make the hormones in your glands.
It is amazing.
Red pill, now available at infowarsstore.com,
and your purchase fugs the operation.
Welcome, welcome, welcome. This is the Alex Jones show.
My name is Milo, and I am standing in for Alex for the next two hours.
Coming up on the show, we have Laura Luma,
the intrepid reporter who is down there in Florida,
figuring out what's happening and working out what the media is trying to do
with what we are obliged to call a senseless tragedy,
but which is in fact, of course, the actions of a nutcase, as we know,
would not have been prevented or ameliorated by more gun control laws.
But Laura is going to talk to us about what the politicians,
and in particular, what CNN is up to down there.
Also coming up on the show, we have Phil LeBonte, who is a rock-metal icon.
He's a lead singer of All That Remains.
He has been called an apologist for the murder of children,
because he came out in support of the Second Amendment
despite the emotional arguments from the media,
everywhere in the media, following the horrible events in Florida.
Something of a somber tone in the streets of Florida.
I live in Miami, in fact, not very far from where this happened,
and it has been a miserable time to be out in South Florida,
sort of the unusually somber tone on the streets, even of Miami.
So, what's going on down there?
Well, before we get into Florida, I have some news related to, well, myself.
And that is Simon and Schuster lawsuit, which today I've announced that I am letting go.
Some of you will remember, Alex is kind enough to bring it up
when I'm on the show from time to time,
that my book Dangerous, which is a New York Times bestseller,
and sold, it was a New York Times bestseller for five weeks,
sold hundreds of thousands of copies, made a lot of money,
was dropped by Simon and Schuster.
I believe that they picked up the book having no intention of publishing it ever,
and probably planning to force me to quit because, you know,
that mocked-up manuscript that hit the Internet,
you saw all those edits that they tried to embarrass me with,
well, there was a reason they did all that.
Anyway, today, we've announced that we've dropped the lawsuit. Why?
Because the book did so well.
And this is the good news story about all of it.
When you sue somebody for damages,
you have to establish that they cost you some money,
or maybe that they cost you some, they did you some reputational damage.
But my book sold so well because people are so extraordinarily frustrated
with the excesses of the progressive left on college campuses,
in the media, in the entertainment industry,
and so fascinated by my story that we realized it was going to be a hard slog,
establishing damages.
As anyone who's been through a lawsuit knows,
getting a damages expert in can cost half a million dollars upwards.
So instead, we've decided to spend the money and spend the time
focusing on releasing new books by freedom lovers, libertarians, conservatives,
anyone who cannot get a fair hearing from the traditional liberal journalists
and media establishment in New York.
Simon has used a statement that I've given to the press today,
so you can go find it.
Pretty much everyone's reporting on it.
Of course, they're all crowing about me dropping the lawsuit,
failing to understand that what I have established with this lawsuit,
which Alex does on the air every day on his show,
and I'm attempting to do in live events and in publishing,
is that we don't need them anymore.
We don't need the progressive media anymore.
We don't need the big liberal Bayermoffs to get our message out,
and not just in small ways, not petty fringe acts of resistance.
We don't need them anymore to become New York Times bestsellers.
We don't need them anymore to have massive shows listened to by millions of people.
Simon has used it as demonstrated that when you behave badly and you treat
not just authors but their readers like pieces of, you know what,
the conservatives and libertarians and freedom lovers everywhere
can just go out and do it on their own.
Alex has done it, I've done it,
and we both encourage you to do the same thing.
So I'm going to be focusing on dangerous books, which is my new book imprint,
and it's all very good news.
Another bit of news related to me, and then we can get on to the actual news,
because people do like me to give a little update, a little Milo update.
Phoenix, I have a show in Phoenix, and here's what Antifa has been up to in Phoenix.
The promoter for the Phoenix tour, I'm reading from notes that I just got sent
by my booking agent.
The promoter from Phoenix made the mistake of putting his logo on a poster
for my speech, which is due on Friday.
Intimidating men then rang his home doorbell and started threatening his girlfriend.
His girlfriend is now terrified.
They phoned every venue that he has ever worked with in the past or works with currently.
And Antifa has been tweeting him every 10 minutes, all day, every day,
with threats of physical violence and death threats against him
and anybody that comes to his shows with the result that one venue's already canceled their relationship with him.
And Antifa has threatened to take this guy's livelihood away for the crime of hosting me.
Well, the show, I am sure, will go on. We're working it out right now.
Now, onto the news in Florida.
Well, what were the reasons for this shooting?
What moved a young guy to open fire and kill 17 people?
We may never know what's in this guy's head,
but we can make some observations, I think, about the prevailing culture.
I think we can make some observations about what's been happening to America in the last couple of decades,
which might be leading young boys to act out.
Now, the first thing to say about Florida, South Florida, and in particular, Broward County, where this happened,
is that they had a new initiative aimed at school safety but rooted in social justice
that was instituted a little while ago, August of 2017.
They brought in a new initiative.
It was called the Broward County solution.
And the Broward County solution was designed, get this,
to reduce the statistical disparity between black and Hispanic arrests versus white and Asian arrests.
And of course, this young guy, whose name contained Jesus and Cruz, this Nicholas with a K,
would have fallen under the Hispanic definition of this new policy from Broward County schools.
A Denver organization called Padres y Jovinas Unidas,
successfully advocated for a program like Browards to achieve racial and educational equity in Denver schools.
This policy designed to, in other words, turn a blind eye to minor infractions from students of color,
students from so-called marginalized communities,
and to punish more harshly the wrongdoing of white students and Asian students
because there's a disparity in the statistics.
It never occurred to anybody that it might be a good idea to fix the reason that there is a disparity in the crimes committed.
No, this was a superficial fix, which is exactly what social justice does.
It's exactly what social justice is entirely predictable that they would treat the symptoms
and leave the disease rostering. Rostering is not a word.
Leave the disease rotting and festering. That's what I was going for.
Cruz, of course, had been suspended from Stoneman Douglas High,
not just for fighting, but for being caught with bullets.
Now, to say nothing of the FBI's utter incompetence,
and we're going to speak to Laura Loomer in the second hour that I'm on today
about whether there's any incentive that the FBI might conceivably have
for not pulling these people in and for allowing these crimes kind of tacitly to happen.
Aside from the FBI's incompetence, if Broward County did not have this policy,
is it conceivable that this young guy Cruz might have been removed from schools
and might have been removed from the community sooner?
Fighting? No big deal. But the guy was carrying around bullets.
Let's not put him in juvie. Let's let him go because he's got the name Hazus and Cruz.
Of course, this is not the first time it happened in Miami.
I'm talking about Trayvon Martin.
It seems to me that if we stop holding boys to female behavior standards,
stop feminizing our playgrounds, stop throwing them all on antidepressant drugs,
Dylan Roof, of course, being the best example of a young boy thrown on drugs,
maybe we wouldn't have these outbursts of so-called toxic masculinity.
Masculinity is not toxic, but it can become dangerous
if it is suppressed and abused by an increasingly feminized educational establishment.
Masculinity is great.
It's what got us to the stars.
It's what built the internet, that testosterone-fueled desire to make women happy
and to impress fellow men.
But it can go bad when it's suppressed and you've got to bear in mind a lot.
In fact, I think every one of these school shooters, these young white school shooters,
was on antidepressant drugs for which we don't necessarily have a clear idea of the consequences.
After the break, we're going to talk about a change in American culture
away from so-called bourgeois culture.
We'll be right back.

InfowarsLive is bringing you a breakthrough
in modern medicine.
We have found an extraordinary new natural way
to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
This is pollen block.
In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people
who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms
experienced less seasonal distress symptoms
like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
and excessive mucus production.
And again, studying the effects in published trials,
in their published trials, now we are introducing
the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet,
just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress
and fast-acting pollen block starts working
in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress

In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
Hello, hello, hello. Welcome back.
I'm Marlon Oppel is filling in for Alex Jones.
I'm in my CPAC outfit, by the way.
It's CPAC this week.
I'll be headlining a party with Mike Cernovich,
Stefan Molyneux, a couple of other people in Washington, D.C.
I'm dressed in my young Republican loser outfit today for you.
Little bow tie. It's wonderful.
And we're talking about what happened in Florida.
And I'll take a moment before we move back on to that serious subject,
by the way, to thank the producers for this lovely pink
and purple-washed background.
I think they're heckling me.
Yes, it is Infowars the Alex Jones show,
but slightly gayer than you know it.
Now, what happened in Florida
was the result of a broken and damaged young man.
But these things don't happen in isolation.
And if it's true that they're happening with increasing frequency
and regularity, if Dylan Roof and Mr. Cruz are just the first
in a new wave of this, it bears examination.
It's worth us considering why it might be.
And it's worth us considering whether there's anything over the last 30 years
that might have left boys in such a terrible state.
Now, the left is going to tell you that toxic masculinity
is in large part responsible for the acts of people like Dylan Roof and young Mr. Cruz.
They're going to tell you that runaway male characteristics, violence,
the instinct to cause death, to spread suffering, to inflict oneself on others
are responsible for this outburst.
And they're going to tell you that the ready availability of guns is enabling that.
But for quite some time, a brand of dissident feminist scholars
has been suggesting that what we have is not too much masculinity,
but in fact too little.
In culture, men are regularly perceived as idiots, as dunderheads, blundering buffoons.
Chris Pratt's character in Parks and Recreation isn't just an amusing new way
of looking at a weak man in relationships with strong women,
but was in fact something of a herald
for the way that culture was going to consider and treat men since.
And this has been going on since before the beginning of Parks and Recreation.
Now scholars like Helen Smith and Christina Hofsommers
have published books on the subject, Men on Strike by Helen Smith
and The War Against Boys by Christina Hofsommers.
Both deal with the question of boys, natural boisterousness and energy,
hugely excessive energy levels we all remember being there.
Being not just tempered, but suffocated by an increasingly feminized society
and in particular increasingly feminized education.
And one of the results of that, of course,
one of the results of constantly judging boys by the standards,
usually yes, there he is, there is Chris Pratt.
Actually, by the way, Chris, I don't want to say anything too mean about Chris Pratt
because I have a reasonably strong suspicion that he's one of the only proper,
freedom-loving, gum-toting Republicans in Hollywood.
I just wish he would say so.
I'm pretty sure he voted for Trump.
What they'll tell you is that an excess of boyness, of masculinity,
of dude-ness, an outbreak of manhood is responsible for this violence.
But actually, it's manhood being suppressed and suffocated
and then exploding out in unexpected and devastating ways,
according to a new breed of dissident feminists and according to me.
All they say is that men are being treated by being judged by female behavior standards
and when they don't meet them, they're either being punished or they're being drugged.
Now, most people know about the Adderall crisis.
I wrote a column in 2015 as long ago as that for Breitbart saying to stop mass killers,
we have to stop drugging our young boys.
A dependence on prescription drugs to control the behavior of young boys.
So they don't get out of hand, so they're not loud in class,
so they don't have fistfights in the playground,
all the stuff that boys need to do when they're growing,
when they're getting the energy out of their systems.
All of this is tampered down by an extraordinary explosion in the prescription drug,
where it's an epidemic, even Esquire magazine recognized it,
and quite some time ago, of drugs like Adderall being given to young boys
to control their behavior, because healthy behavior norms for young boys
have become stigmatized by wider culture and have become anathema
to the invariably female elementary and high school teachers
who would much rather teach the well-put-together, well-behaved, quiet young women
and don't want to have to deal with the much more messy, complex,
and difficult business of raising boys.
So what do they do? They put them on drugs.
Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza, Lexa Pro and Solexa,
redheaded aurora killer James Holmes,
clonazepam and sertraline, Virginia Tech mass murderer
Xiong Hoi Chou, Prozac, Charles Whitman, the Texas Tower Sniper,
Dexadrine, Columbine Executioner Eric Harris and Dylan Claibold,
Zoloft and Luvox. Those are the names of the most famous killers,
or at least some of them, in recent years,
and they were all on these drugs.
Dylan Roof was too, and so it turns out was young Mr. Cruz,
was young Nicholas Cruz. Millions of American men have prescribed powerful drugs
after being diagnosed with a condition that is practically unknown
outside of America, ADHD, ADD, which in healthier cultures,
in more normal cultures, would simply be male boisterousness.
But in America, being a man has become pathologized.
Being a man has become something to apologize for and take medication for.
With this, I'm sorry to say, inevitable and tragic result.
Now, there's a wider question here, and it's a question of culture,
which I want to talk about briefly.
There's a piece in Philly.com, which I found absolutely fascinating.
It's so interesting, and I urge you to go read the whole thing.
What the writer in Philly.com says is that this is part,
if you take the 30,000th view, if you zoom out,
this is part of a wider cultural context in which boys,
and the role of manhood in general, is being written out of society,
and behavior codes that were traditionally have been adhered to
by the bourgeoisie, by the middle classes,
are being stigmatized in favor of free love.
Now, free love, the sexual revolution, was a project of communism,
because, and singularly and especially,
the reason they wanted everybody having sex with everybody,
is because it breaks down the most powerful engine
of Western democratic capitalism, which is the nuclear family.
And this piece in Philly.com, which is really great,
says that there have always been rebels,
but even the deviance back in the day, disavowed or openly disparaged,
revealing expectations.
But the cultural script began to break down in the late 1950s.
Adults with influence over the culture for a variety of reasons
abandoned their role as advocates for respectability, civility,
and adult values, because all cultures are not equal.
And the culture that we like to think obtained in the good old days,
in the 1950s, didn't produce these killers.
It didn't produce these troubled young men.
And it all boils down in many of the cases of the kids that I read
who were on these drugs equally to fatherlessness too.
Absent fathers, these white families represent,
if you don't mind me saying so, if it's not too rude,
more like a ghetto family in the fatherlessness and absent parenting.
And that's one clue as to how this stuff is happening.
We'll be right back.
Hear that?
That's the sound of a house being trashed
while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.

Welcome back.
I am Milo standing in for Alex Jones in this slightly gay edition
of InfoWars and the Alex Jones Show.
I'll be joined shortly by the most handsome man in music,
at least I think so, anyone following his Instagram account,
ladies out there with the fondness for metal and rock.
Go check out his Instagram.
We'll come to him in a second now.
One of the most amusing aspects of, well, it's sad too,
but it is also funny, one of the most amusing aspects of the aftermath
of any of these kinds of events is watching liberal celebrities
and politicians clamor to virtue signal in public while proposing solutions
that would do nothing to prevent this stuff in future
and would only infringe on people's freedoms.
Gun supporters really believe,
Second Amendment advocates honestly believe
that their guns are there to protect them against tyranny
and against assailants and criminals and whatnot,
and you're not going to persuade them with entreaties to the heart
because their entreaty comes from the heart too.
It's about protecting their families.
It's about protecting their civil liberties.
So you're just fighting your emotions with theirs.
It's not going to get you anywhere,
but one of the most amusing new things which I have not seen before,
I've never seen this happen before, is the metal community
and music in general, which typically appeals to men,
heterosexual, masculine, hypermasculine, white men in many cases,
this kind of music starting to buckle under pressure,
and in particular, singers, maybe there's something about singers,
maybe they're upset, they don't get to bash the drums or something,
something about singers.
There seems to be a little outbreak in metal and in rock
of singers who traditionally would have had much more sensible opinions
about things like free speech in the Second Amendment.
Coming out in support of gun control.
Now joining me is Phil Labonte from All That Remains,
a band that I know that many Infowars listeners,
many Alex Jones fans are going to be huge, huge devotees too.
Thank you so much for joining us, and thank you for being on camera too.
You can see there's rippling muscles under this.
Look at those traps, my goodness.
Now if you find it, Phil that remains on Instagram,
if I were into white guys, my goodness.
Now, you are a supporter of the Second Amendment,
you are a supporter of many of the same values
as the sort of populist, patriotic,
freedom-loving America movement,
the people who voted for Donald Trump and all the rest of it.
Now, you are not one of the singers,
one of the members of the metal community
who is advocating for gun control in light of this event,
quite the opposite, and you're coming in for a bit of criticism as a result.
What happened to you?
No, I do not advocate for gun control.
In light of the Florida shooting,
a lot of people reacted emotionally, which is understandable,
and there's a lot of people making calls for gun control,
but they don't really elaborate what they're asking for.
So I think that a lot of the breakdown between people that would be considered on my side
and people that would be considered on the other side,
a lot of the breakdown is trying to understand each other.
So I made a short video that was trying to explain why,
after these shootings, there isn't just an instant law pass
that'll just fix the problem and that if there is a law pass,
that law is going to come with problems.
And so I put up the video and there is a metal blog
that has had an issue with me for a long time
because I just won't go away apparently.
Twenty years of being in the same band
and ten years of these guys' dog in me because I won't stop making music
because it's basically the history of it.
You mean to tell me that the inflamed objections
of social justice warriors have not been enough
to turn you off your lifelong passion in your career?
Good heavens.
You know, I know that.
There's music in you at Crumble.
Fall over like a pack of jokers.
No, you're an inspiring guy.
Well, thank you. I call that, by the way.
I call that the end call to thank you.
Have you ever noticed when she's paid a compliment?
Whenever she's paid a compliment on cable news, she'll say thank you.
I think we should all start.
We should all start again.
Now listen, you posted a video trying to build bridges
between the people who want all the guns taken away
and the people who appreciate what they're for
and what they're about.
What do you get called?
What do you get accused of as a result of this video?
You know, I'm supporting the death of children.
And wrongly, they said that it was about the NRA and stuff,
which I mean, most of your viewers here would know
that the NRA is a result of the people that would vote for gun control.
It's not a cause.
The support for the Second Amendment isn't because of the NRA.
The support for the Second Amendment created the NRA.
So the NRA doesn't make people vote a certain way.
It's that people vote this way and the NRA kind of jumps in and says,
oh, we'll go ahead and give you a hand to spread your word.
But the left hates the NRA because the NRA is one of the few examples
of a truly effective, rich, well put together,
beautifully oiled, right-wing advocacy group.
I mean, we don't have much like that.
We have almost nothing.
We don't have, I mean, the ACLU,
which is supposed to stand up for free speech in the First Amendment,
is gone.
All the organizations that nominally stand up for American freedoms have gone left.
Conservatives have very few, if any, other organizations
assigned to the NRA that stand up for their values.
Totally. I completely agree with you.
And this particular issue does go beyond the Second Amendment
because it filters into the larger culture war, obviously.
I notice some similarities with all media that you're familiar with
from Gamergate, from your experience with Gamergate.
And also, you see it with the mainstream or legacy media,
whatever you want to call them.
And they kind of all use the same similar tactics.
And that's exactly what this metal blog in particular did to me.
They strawmaned the argument and then accused me of terrible things.
And lied in the Facebook post about it.
And to me, it was expected that I wouldn't get any kind of support
from these kind of people with these perspectives.
I understand that.
But when it was just libelous claims about me
when really all I was trying to do was help people to understand
why there hasn't been an immediate law after one of these terrible shootings.
And it's not because people are callous or don't care.
It's because it's not as simple as that.
As soon as you start talking about passing laws,
you do run into the Constitution.
And so, like I said, it's beyond just the Second Amendment
because if you're going to go ahead and pass laws that circumvent the Second Amendment,
you're going to see these same people looking to pass laws.
Yeah, they're going to come for the first.
We're going to go to break in a minute, but I just want to get you.
If you can stay with us for another 10 minutes,
we'll hold you over a little bit into the next segment.
Let me just get your reaction to there is a metal blog called Metal Sucks.
No comment on whether it's connected to the rest of our interview.
And they have a manifesto.
They have a statement of purpose.
And they say, we've never been an unbiased media outlet, fair enough.
Nor do you plan to become one.
We believe in progressive values.
OK, fine. Websites coverage extends beyond simply metal.
Well, that's because they have aspirations to be great cultural commentators.
They're not happy with just talking about riffs anymore.
Websites coverage extends.
We believe in an artist's right to express political beliefs.
Now, hang on. Here's where it starts to go wrong.
We believe, says Metal Sucks, in an artist's and our right to express political beliefs through their work.
Well, I mean, they do sometimes.
I don't know if it's presumably a communist or a feminist or somebody self-flagellating over white guilt.
I imagine not a lot of that happens in the metal business.
But what was amazing to me reading this was the comments underneath.
The comments underneath from their own readers who are absolutely brutal.
They say silence is complicity.
We are proud social justice warriors.
We will not be bullied.
Well, they are the bullies and they are the people engaging in hate speech.
We're going to talk a little bit about that, about the entertainment industry more generally after the break.
Phil LeBonte from All That Remains, a rare example of somebody who is genuinely actually successful and famous, who doesn't mind speaking out.
We'll be right back. Thanks so much.

From the front lines of the Information Roar, it's Alex Jones.
Welcome back. It's me, everybody's favorite pocket homosexual. I'm an acceptable kind of gay because I like guns and the Bible.
Right, we're talking to Phil from All That Remains about his experiences speaking out as a defender of the Second Amendment, and we're going to jump straight back into it.
Phil, thank you for joining us. Now, various people, and let's be kind and not call them out, but various other, and it does seem to be singers, doesn't it?
It's the frontmen. It's not the bass players or the guitarists or the drummers. There's something about you guys.
And you know, singers are the divas of the band. You know, they've got you and you're constantly posting pictures of, you know, lifting in the gym and all the rest of it.
You know, like, prim little divas, your attention whores, aren't you? Anyway, the singers in metal are starting to feel the pressure, I guess, from journalists, from culture at large.
And this happened to, let's say, rock journalism first. Rock journalism, you know, Playboy Rolling Stone went that way many decades ago, and now they're fully, you know, paid up in the tank, whatever.
But singers themselves, resisted until relatively recently, I was very disappointed by one of my idols, Marilyn Manson, who, by any other ordinary metrics, you know, by any usual measurement, should have been at least a Trump sympathizer,
or should have enjoyed the spectacle, enjoyed the horror and chaos, and should have hated social justice warriors. He did a silly video, and he said silly things, and these singers are going soft and bowing to pressure.
Tell us, as somebody who is, you know, one of the princes of that kingdom, what is going on? Why are the heroes of, you know, regular Americans who support their rights to speak their mind and to, you know, shoot their guns?
Why are our heroes going soft and bending to pressure on, you know, what's effectively conspiracy theories, you know, gun control, that won't save a single life?
What is happening to your colleagues?
I don't know, I don't know, I can't speak for anyone else. I do understand that it's, that there is a lot of pressure from the media, from, you know, so there is a lot of social pressure to have the correct opinions, the politically correct opinions.
And when you're dealing with something like this particular shooting and guns in general, I think that it's hard to come up with an actual answer, so when you're kind of expected to say something on it and you don't really have a good answer, it's really tough to be out there and have people asking you and talking about it and be like,
Palms up dude, I don't know, you know. Is that what they say in the, in the world? Palms up dude, I don't know. Let me try again, let me try again, let me try again, let me try again, let me get it right.
Palms up dude, I don't know. Is that good? Pretty close, pretty close. There was a little more condescension in your version than I, than I think it is intended for. Oh, okay, so I should be like Palms up dude, I don't know.
Yeah, exactly. There we go, perfect. I could be a rock singer, I could be a rock singer. I just have to learn to scream. There's the melodic screaming you guys do, which, you know, you can like hold a tune and say words at the same time as horrible eruptions are happening further down your esophagus.
No, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's an entrancing thing to listen to. This is, this is what gets me. This is what's so confusing. This is like the ultimate expression of hypermasculine aggressiveness. It's fabulous.
And then you've got these, these people doing this on stage and in their records and they come off screen and say, oh yeah, we should have gone control. Yeah. Yeah, please take our guns away.
What the hell? I, I, again, again, I'm not looking to dog any one out, but they don't, the arguments don't make any sense to me. I don't feel like the arguments for gun control are good arguments.
And I feel like we've experimented with an assault rifle ban and there was no change in gun violence.
We should not use the words of the enemy by the way. We should avoid the phrase assault. Please don't use the phrase assault rifle, assault weapon. Just stop it.
See, this is it. You know, once you start using their, once you start using their language, you know, you're kind of like implicitly accept some of their premises because as soon as you use the expression assault weapons or assault rifle, you have to defend it.
And it's like, well, you see, as in the case with assault weapons, you know, there's no evidence. What do you mean assault weapon? Stop it. Stop it Phil.
That's the thing. That's the thing about it, though. But I mean, it's, it's much easier to say an A, you know, to say an assault rifle. That is to say a magazine fed semi automatic.
This is where you're getting it wrong. Feminists don't talk about, you know, what feminists have this whole language, you know, it's micro aggressions, it's patriarchy.
This is like a systematic encoded expression of white sis hat that is designed to exclude if only gun advocates were a bit more arcane and obscure and different.
No, if they do, they're like, well, this is a bolt stock X mounted rack.
And you just see liberal journalists go, huh.
That's what I was trying to avoid with the video in the first place. I was trying to help.
No, don't try to help. Stop trying to help. You're not helping. Stop trying to stop trying to help. You're not going to persuade anybody who doesn't already agree with you.
All you have to do is ridicule, bully, demean and humiliate the enemy into total submission. What are you thinking?
Just, just tack nuke them, right?
Yeah, exactly. Do do do to them what you do to your poor vocal cords. It is, of course, the 20th anniversary of all that remains.
Have you found founding the band back in the day? You've been in the business for 20 years. Huge successes under your belt.
You are, as I said, just before we went to break last time, just to pay you one final compliment.
And then I promise for the entire rest of the time we know each other for the next seven decades, I will do nothing but call you up.
Things I can't say on this show because it's indicated, but I will do nothing.
The things that actually, the things that make me feel like I'm endeared to you.
Yes, yes, yes. You're taunting. Look, taunting is how men bond, you know, you know, being mean to each other is how we express our love.
And this is why when feminists say, can't you just treat us like you treat each other? I'm thinking to myself, sweetheart, you do not want that.
Treat you like I treat my friends. I'm going to be like pranking you. I'm going to be abusing you. I'm going to be ridiculing you.
I'm going to be laughing at you. I'm going to be setting you up to fail.
I'm going to have seven people in a bar laughing at you know, because I heard that your penis was small.
You do not want men to treat you like they treat each other. You do not.
No, anyway, and the thing is, and the thing is, and we can go off on this for hours and hours, you go ahead and you treat them like that.
And then they go to the police. They're like, oh, they are the HR.
Well, you see, the women have, you know what, I'm not going to get you into trouble by continuing this discussion because I already know that metal sucks.
Imagine reading a blog. And this is the, and just to finish up with you, because I know you've got to go, you're a busy guy.
But this is a social justice left-wing blog about metal. So it's got a readership of nine.
But they call it metal sucks. It's like they don't hide their contempt for the art form. It's right there in plain view.
Then they say so in this ludicrous manifesto, we will not tolerate hate speech or threats leveled at us or anyone who reads our site, blah, blah, blah.
If you disagree with any of the above to the point of intolerance, please feel free to take your readership elsewhere.
We will not miss you or we won't miss you either.
What's intolerance? I mean, they disagree?
Yes, yes, it's disagreeing. Intolerance is disagreeing.
Well, I think people will make up their own minds about which side of the debate sit on there.
All I think is sad is that even icons in industries that would previously have been utterly immune from social justice and from the pressures of the progressive left seem to be toppling as well.
And they topple for the worst of reasons. They topple over emotions. They topple over emotionally charged news stories instead of facts, reason, logic.
Well, at least if you're wondering where next to point to your ears and your pocketbook, consider all that remains instead of one of these other cucked metal bands.
Phil, thanks so much for joining us. Congratulations on your 20th anniversary.
20 years in the business, still on top. And thank you for resisting the seductive entreaties, the siren call.
You have strapped yourself to the mast so you can sail past the island unscathed and untainted by social justice corruption.
Thank you so much. Thank you very much. And I'm sure we'll see you again.
It's remarkable to me. Thank you so much, Fulavante. It's remarkable to me how even rock and metal singers.
It's all over. It's all over. We've got to create your own culture, folks. You've got to support people who are not mental.
Make your own bands and stop paying attention to the crazies of the social justice lunatic universe.
Thank you very much. Next hour, I'm sorry, you've got me again. We're going to be looking at some video clips.
The left, using children. We've got Laura Luma coming up and a bunch of other stuff. Thank you very much.
We will be right back after these messages.
Let's talk to Victor in Florida. Victor, you're calling? Go ahead.
Yes. Hi, Alex. First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
In particular, Silver Bullet, as soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, maybe like a little raffiness in my throat,
I drop some Silver Bullet and I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
And I just ordered the body, the alpha power and the pollen block.
Well, let me just say something, Victor. It's people like you that then fund the whole operation because a very small percentage of people buy products
and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
But when you mention the Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
It is our highest-reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted high-quality Colloidal Silver.
It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money
while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWareShore.com.
Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip

Click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWareShore.com, this is a sure win.

He lies. He lies. The man in the sky lies. It isn't Alex Jones. I'm sorry to disappoint you.
It's me. I'm not standing in for Alex Jones in this final hour coming into the Alex Jones show here on InfoWareShore.
And I have been asked to tell you about this.
I have previously, by the way, tried out some of the InfoWareShore products.
I had Brainforce the first time I did the show. I did feel more energized, I have to be honest.
Although I had a little handful of them, so maybe I temporarily overdosed.
But I did feel a little peppy. It could have been the presence of the dark lord in this chair.
Maybe it was the Brainforce. Who knows? Give it a try.
This is Icyurin. I've always wanted to be one of those girls, the women on game shows that show the washing machines or the vacuum cleaners.
And if you open box seven, you could win this Electrolux vacuum cleaner.
And the girl says, alas, it was not to be.
Icyurin, it's simple. More toxins and diseases find their way into your system.
Another important thing is that your body's detox systems can keep up because your liver and kidneys are the most important detoxifiers.
This is a 30-day liver cleanse. And they didn't give this to me.
But I am going to take it and try it and report back the next time they are stupid enough to allow me back in the studio.
Milk, thistle extract, which I've heard is good. It's a powerful set of ingredients.
Support your liver and kidneys to help the fight back against toxins.
I'm on a bit of a diet at the moment, so I don't have many toxins. But let's see. I'll report back. I'll let you know how it is.
All right, now the Department of Homeland Security. Just a little brief story before we have to go to our break.
This is our short segment, but I just want to tell you a bit about this and we'll carry on when we get back.
The Department of Homeland Security is going to publish proof of the story on Infowars of massive Democrat voter fraud in 2016.
And this is according to someone who has been QNN, who has been tantalizing the Internet with his insider scoops on the Trump administration.
The National Director of National Intelligence, together with the Department of Homeland Security reports Jerome Corsay for Infowars says they're planning to publish in March a study of the 2016 elections
that will demonstrate massive Democrat Party voter fraud of a magnitude sufficient to have influenced election outcomes.
President Trump signed an executive order disbanding the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in 2018 because states controlled by the Democrats refused to cooperate.
Many Democrats breathed a sigh of relief thinking he'd given up his effort to uncover and correct decades of Democrat Party voter fraud.
But it turns out that something might be there after all.
And it's remarkable, isn't it?
We'll talk about Michael Moore and the Russia-funded anti-Trump protest later in the show when we have Laura Lumeau who's up there in Florida.
But it's remarkable, isn't it? The allegations that have come to nothing.
There is no evidence whatsoever that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, none.
And what evidence there is that Russia may have attempted to interfere in the American election is muddy at best.
One thing Russia did was fund an anti-Trump rally, which Michael Moore was at because he is the definition of useful idiot.
So no, the Trump campaign as far as we know right now did not collude with Russia and Russia as far as we know right now did not affect the outcome of the US presidential election.
But voter fraud, which conservatives have always said was something the Democrats have been up to in every election since forever, might have made a difference.
Not enough to swing it, obviously.
But maybe it made a difference. Maybe he would have won by more.
Maybe that the illusory 3 million mystery Hillary voters, who knows, amazing how dead people always seem to vote Democrat.
I guess we'll find out when DHS publishes this report.
Very exciting. We'll get into that a little more when we come back.
Very exciting. A study of the 26 elections demonstrating massive Democrat party vote of a magnitude sufficient to influence election outcomes.
Incredible. We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
That's infowarslife.com.
This information, it's Alex Jones.
Hello.
We are back.
This is why I'm speaking like an Edwardian English gentleman, Rebecca, on Infra-Wars.
I'm Milo Novelis, standing in for Alex Jones.
That's how we used to speak in my country before we got enamored with America.
Fell in love with you guys. Now I sound like some kind of mid-Atlantic hussy.
Madonna, Julian Anderson.
In the short segment, we mentioned a new story on Infra-Wars.com, which bears repeating.
So let's just have a quick recap of it.
Who knew after years, here's something. Here's a tip for you.
When social justice warriors, liberals, Democrats, the left in general, laughs hysterically at a claim made by the right,
for which we don't yet have conclusive evidence, but all the signs point that way.
And anybody with half a brain can see it's probably true.
And when it's floated, the left finds a way to turn it into an object of ridicule.
Most recently, for instance, that strange marking on Obama's forehead in his official portrait,
which became a story about the credulousness of Sean Hannity to cover up the fact that it was almost certainly true
that the artist who did the Obama's official portraits had snuck in, well, an unusual shape on the former president's forehead.
Something left there by Michelle, perhaps.
One of the things that, yes, there it is.
I think we've probably...
Draw your own conclusions as to whether an artist with a long history of including spermatozoa in his artworks
may have mischievously snuck one in the most important painting he'll ever do.
His signature, his trademark, his signature move is hiding the little swimmers in his artwork.
And we're expected to believe that he did not do it in the Obama portrait,
despite the fact that I think everybody can see the little...
And in fact, if you colour it, so you can see...
I mean, you guys know by now.
Anyway, when Democrats are laughing at you, when they are sniggering and scoffing and making you feel stupid,
and that's how you know, that's the one to look out for,
when they are doing their darndest to make you feel like an idiot,
it's often the best sign that you're into something.
And the best new piece of reporting to establish this immutable and everlasting observation
comes from Infowars.com, Jerome Corsay, writing Infowars.
The Department of Homeland Security is about to publish proof of massive Democrat voting fraud.
And not just voting fraud.
This comes, by the way, from QAnon, who is the...
We don't know who he is, he seems to be an insider.
Some presence around Trump, who knows.
Of course, again, that's one that the Liberals have tried to make you feel stupid about.
Thinking that he might be real, but all of the verisimilitude is there.
And so he says, this is a report on Infowars.com, you can go find it.
The Director of National Intelligence together with the Department of Homeland Security
and the FBI are planning to publish in March a study of the 2016 elections
that will demonstrate massive Democrat party voter fraud of a magnitude,
and here's the key section of a magnitude sufficient to have influenced election outcomes.
That's the killer line. That's the one to take away with you.
When they laugh at you, when they call you stupid, when they scoff at you,
when the verified Liberals on Twitter...
Imagine these idiots believing this.
When they do that, it's a reasonably good sign that you're onto something.
Later in the show, in this final hour, we're going to be speaking to Laura Luma,
who is a former Project Veritas operative.
She's now an independent investigative journalist.
She went into Mandalay Bay after Mandalay Bay said they'd fixed their security problems
and rode the elevator up and down the service elevator.
She's now in Florida, and she's going to join us at about half past to talk to you about the machinations
of everyone's favorite cable news network, CNN,
who for some reason are hosting a rehearsal of their town hall meeting.
It's like a free, open debate that CNN is hosting,
but they're having a rehearsal for it, presumably so that if anyone brings up any really good persuasive arguments
against gun control that they can be fully prepared for them and know how to swap them down.
Good Lord.
So Laura Luma is going to join us.
She's also going to...
We're going to play a video later in the show of her confronting local officials.
But in the meantime, before we get to all that, I want to move on to something that Liberals
have done increasingly in recent years, probably in the last half decade,
which is using children to promulgate their political ideologies.
Using young people to tug on the heartstrings of reasonable, but perhaps impressionable ordinary Americans
to try to persuade them of things that cannot be established with fact, reason and logic alone
and which therefore must be intimidated and bullied and manipulated into the public consciousness with appeals to the heart.
So the first clip I want to play is the Florida School Shooting Survivor,
and it's this little guy, David Hogg, and he's on CNN, and he's being asked to talk about Trump's tweet after the Florida School Shooting.
So let's play that clip.
It's about a minute, and it's a Florida School Shooting Survivor turned resistance poster boy, David Hogg,
who said on Monday on CNN that Trump should be blamed for the shooting and not the FBI,
where, well, just coincidentally, his dad used to work.
Let's play that clip.
What did you both think about the president tweeting over the weekend?
Very sad that the FBI missed all the signs, signals sent out by the Florida School Shooter.
This is not acceptable.
They're spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.
There is no collusion.
Get back to basics and make us all proud.
Yeah, I think it's disgusting personally.
My father's a retired FBI agent, and the FBI are some of the hardest working individuals I've ever seen in my life.
They work every day 24-7 to ensure the lives of every single American in this country,
and it's wrong that the president is blaming them for this.
After all, he is in charge of the FBI.
All right, that'll do.
You can almost see him reading a teleprompter.
I don't know if he is, but there's a certain, I can tell you as a performer,
there's a sort of glazed look in your eyes when you're reading out a script that you've rehearsed,
and he got the look.
CNN has been coaching young people to give these impassioned, desperate emotional entreaties
with talking points cooked up by people in the intelligence agencies.
I mean, this guy's dad was in the FBI, undisclosed by CNN.
But just watch, and we'll play a little bit of this before we go to break it,
and I want to come back to it afterwards, just watch what happens
when the same student can't remember his lines interviewed on a different occasion.
This comes from a Gateway Pundit, our friends over at Gateway Pundit,
and this is David Hoggs stumbling over his words in an interview
talking about drills on the day of the shooting
when he has forgotten the talking points, presumably provided to him by his FBI,
former FBI agent, dad.
Watch this one.
We had had a fire alarm earlier that day, and that was a drill,
so we thought this was a drill too, just another one,
because we have a lot of fire alarms, a lot of fire drills at the school.
After we heard the first drill, actually, that was a bad choice.
Hold on.
Actually, that was a bad choice, because the janitor...
Look, this isn't like a bad child actor.
Like, I'm sorry, daddy, I forgot my lines.
I'm sorry, was that what I was supposed to say?
You wanted me to say guns are bad and trumps a piece of whatever, didn't you?
Did I get it right?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Look, doesn't this kid suffer enough?
Hasn't he had a bad enough time already being nearly killed?
You've got to leap on the poor little devil and have him spout platitudes.
Let me tell you, nobody is as malifluous and fluent and eloquent
as those kids were when coached by CNN.
Indeed, when you see them interviewed by other people, they're not.
Simple explanation for this, which is they're being fed lines.
This is another example of the left moving in on children.
It's bad enough they're drugging all the boys and cutting their wieners off,
pretending they're trans.
Now they're putting words in their mouth to take away your second amendment rights.
Disgusting.
We'll be right back with...
Maybe we'll play that clip again, and then we're going on to see the clip from another student.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
It's a no-brainer.

Welcome back to the Alex Jones show where our speech is free, our guns are loaded, and the only thing we want aborted is political correctness.
Before the break, we played two videos of the same poor kid stumbling over his words because he'd forgotten his coaching.
Let's go straight to a third video that I want to show you, and it's a different Parkland, Florida student wishing.
Well, I'll show you what happened.
This video is what happens when kids are not given talking points by their intelligence agency, globalist, gun control, government oversight, overreach.
Oh, it just makes me mad.
When kids aren't given scripted lines, here's what's more likely to happen. Watch this.
Well, let me ask you, this debate is now emerging about guns on campus.
Do you believe that's something that we should be looking at?
Absolutely. Unfortunately, gun control, it's definitely needed a little bit more.
I don't think that we're going to get gun control in such a quick enough response.
I believe that if we did bring firearms on campus to teachers that are willing to carry their firearm on school campus, if they got their correct training for it,
I think that would be a big beneficial factor into school safety because, I mean, if Coach Feis had had his firearm in school that day,
there we go, out of the mouths of, well, not quite babes, of course, he's a little older than the previous speaker,
but still student, ROTC student, seen a little bit more of the world, doesn't presumably have a left-wing globalist FBI dad able to speak a bit more freely.
And there we go.
We're going to bring in Laura Luma, who is on the ground in Florida, to talk a little bit more about the aftermath of the shooting.
But before we do that, I'm going to play a video, this is our video segment.
I'm going to play a video of her confronting an anti-gun Florida congressman.
Now, I'll read you what she got up to, and then you can see Laura in action.
One of the things that's fun about her, she really is fearless.
I know Laura gets a lot of criticism online.
She gets a lot of ridicule, mainly because she once struggled to tell the difference between a slash tire and a dry rot tire.
I had her on my show, and I made her play rot or not.
I put pictures of tires up, and I have to tell you, she had a very good strike rate.
So maybe it was just the one-off.
Anyway, Laura's been up there, and there's a Ted Deutsch, I guess his name is, is that how you say it in America?
Ted Deutsch, lying to his constituents, telling them AR-15s are assault weapons, and were banned before 2004.
So this is a lie, and this was a gun control meeting hosted by every town, one of the nation's largest anti-gun organizations.
Laura went to confront this guy for lying to his constituents.
Here's what happened.
Ready?
Yes.
I'll actually, let me just go before you ask any questions.
You're from Info Wars?
Yes.
Here's my message to you.
The fact that your, I won't even call it a publication, I don't know what it is,
but the fact that you called what happened in Sandy Hookah Hoax, refused to apologize for it,
is among the most obscene things that has ever been broadcast anywhere.
You should be ashamed.
Anyone who reads the garbage like that that you post should be ashamed,
and I will never give an interview to you.
So you're calling about 40%, you're calling about 40% of the country absolute garbage.
You know, as a congressman, you're supposed to represent Republicans and Democrats,
not just the base that you want to pander to and lie to during your speech about gun control.
Let me tell you something.
Every Republican that I know...
He can't resist.
Pause that for a second.
Pause that for a second.
He can't resist.
This is the, look, the Sandy Hook thing, you know,
let's take the uncharitable perspective,
and let's take the uncharitable route and say that, you know,
say somebody messed up on a...
You know what?
Let's generalize it.
Breitbart, Infowars, Daily Caller, Gateway Pundit.
All make mistakes.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Everybody makes mistakes.
It's in the business of doing news.
It's called process journalism who people call it.
You tell the facts as you know them at the time.
You speculate, you interpolate, you interpret.
You do the best you can with what you have available at the time.
The difference, though, between Breitbart and Infowars and whatever,
as far as I can see it, is that they do the best job.
We all do the best job when we're watching the Milo Show, whatever.
We all do the best job of telling you what's happening as best we see it.
That pales in comparison to the deliberate outright mendacity
of the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN,
who pose as neutral and through their haughty moral grandstanding,
presumed to pass judgment on people who make far fewer mistakes than they do
and who do so with the best of intentions and with good hearts
in service of freedom and freedom of speech
and the protection of American liberties,
and who do not outright lie.
CNN has been caught in so many outright lies.
And you see in this guy's response the canned, prepared remarks
of somebody who is more interested in moral grandstanding,
much more interested in pandering to his whoever the women were behind him.
Then he isn't engaging in debate and he walks away but he can't resist.
He cannot help himself but get drawn further in
so he can issue further exhortations of moral grandstanding.
Let's let him carry on because unlike their side,
we like letting people have their say.
We enjoy giving people a platform they deny to others,
mostly because they tend to fall straight off it and into the dirt,
break their noses when given the platform.
We don't shy away from debate.
We warmly encourage classical liberalism, the open marketplace of ideas,
even if liberals misuse it to bully, intimidate, harass, smear and demean
instead of bringing facts, reason and logic.
But let's let this guy go on because one of the things I like about Laura
is how dogged she is, she just won't let the guy go.
She's like, she's got his trouser leg.
Carry on.
That Sandy Hook was a host as I am.
This is not talking about Sandy Hook.
We're talking about you lying on stage telling your constituents right now
that you're telling them assault weapons.
You're telling them, you lied to them.
You said that they were banned in 2004.
The guns were not banned.
What was banned were the suppressors and the accessories.
So why are you lying to your constituents to put gun control?
Here's what I'm telling you, that every Republican I know
thinks that your efforts to characterize Sandy Hook as a host
is that that is what I'm talking about.
We're talking about the shooting importance.
And you taking this tragedy to push for gun control
if you're going to listen to me, if you're going to listen to me,
you coming to my community, will we just experience
where we just experienced the worst, most horrific shooting in a school
that'll probably do.
I think what tends to happen, the dynamic of this is,
for instance, with Breitbart, I think it's something called ACORN,
which predates my time at Breitbart.
I was at Breitbart for a little while.
And there's that one iconic thing that people are upset at you about
that they just sort of bang on and on and on
and use it as an excuse to not answer questions, to not address the facts.
And Breitbart always gets so much stuff for ACORN.
And it is by no means clear at all who is in the right
with the question of ACORN.
And it is absolutely true, which is when Alex says on this show
that there is something weird about the way the media covers up
and the bulldozing of buildings after these shootings,
there is something weird about it, and it is new,
and it's hardly surprising people ask questions.
And when the FBI covers up what's going on,
doesn't tell people what's happening,
and the media is remarkably incurious about the motivations of people
after these things, it is weird,
and it's hardly surprising people ask questions.
And after the break, we'll have Laura Luma on Vibe Video,
so we'll be right back.

Let's move on.
We've seen her video, the dogged determination of the most hated woman on the Internet.
Not really, but you do have, you do have a hell of a troll army after you,
for which I can only congratulate you.
Well done.
You're obviously doing something right.
Laura Luma, who is up there, the intrepid,
indefatigable, unstoppable, bloodhound, Laura Luma,
up there in Florida, nosing around.
And we have some news to break on the show.
You've lost your Twitter account.
What happened?
Well, yesterday I confronted Congressman Ted Deutsch,
who's a Democrat and anti-gun proponent here in Florida,
who's really just taking advantage of this tragedy, really,
to promote his own agenda.
And I confronted him at a gun grabber meeting.
And then when I posted the video on my Twitter, along with InfoWars,
I received a message this morning saying that I had a seven-day ban on my Twitter.
So I can't put out all of this information.
And I feel like they're really trying to just, like,
limit my expose of what's taking place here in Florida.
Because not only do you have Democrats pushing gun control,
but you have the media organizations like CNN actively coaching these students,
whose parents are tied to globalist organizations like the FBI, for example,
and they're giving them talking points.
And it's a lot of these left-wing corporations and media companies,
including Twitter, who are in on this.
There's the teachers, too.
You told me before we came on air in the last break
that one of the teachers at the school is potentially getting himself into trouble
by telling students to show up at things.
Tell us about that.
Well, I doubt she'll get in trouble,
because, you know, it doesn't really seem like they're willing to hold people accountable anywhere here in Florida.
If it were a just world.
If it were a just world.
But there's an individual by the name of Sarah Lerner,
and she's a journalism and English teacher at the high school here in Parkland, Florida.
And she's violating the Florida Code of Conduct for teachers
by texting students on their personal cell phone number.
I mean, that's a really big no-no.
In the era of, like, teacher sex scandals,
you're not supposed to be texting students on their personal cell phone numbers.
Is he getting those numbers from their, like, confidential student records?
Yes, I believe so, because a lot of students are receiving different numbers from different teachers.
Who shares their phone number with their teacher when they're like 11 years old or something?
You don't give your cell phone number to your science teacher?
That's the other point of what I was going to bring up,
is our taxpayer dollars go towards funding these public schools in Florida.
And the fact that those records are supposed to be confidential,
and they're now being used and harvested by these very liberal anti-Trump teachers
who are using it to push gun control, I mean, that's a...
I think the school deserves to be investigated.
I think that the school deserves to be investigated,
because at this point in time they're leaking confidential information about students.
What has upset me, and I take a disinterested perspective on many things,
but I don't have children myself, but I'm not a monster.
And my husband as a kid, and what makes me horrified
now that I have that presence in my extended family,
you know, like a kid that you have to care for and look after,
you want to nurture and lead through a good life,
you want to teach them to be thoughtful and have integrity,
make up their own minds about things and to be educated,
is the way that left-wingers are increasingly leveraging children in their propaganda wars.
And this is, you know, the perfect thorn for them in a way.
You came on my show earlier this week and suggested,
not that the FBI had a hand in this, because of course they didn't,
but that there might be a reason why authorities in different branches of government
are perhaps not proactively getting these people off the streets.
I mean, this guy, was it 39 times, the cops were called to his house?
The FBI knew about him, but they didn't stop him from doing this.
Now, nobody's saying that they knew when and where and how it was going to go down,
but they knew about him, and they presumably could have done something
to make people around him safer, and they didn't.
Talk to us about why you think, is it, well,
is there an incentive, is there a reason why the FBI is not doing so?
Is there a reason why the FBI is not getting these people the treatment they need,
or just incarcerating them when they're found in school with, like, bullets?
What's that, what is the FBI thinking?
Like, not actively and enthusiastically investigating this stuff?
Are they really just all tied up with this bogus Russia investigation?
What is happening over there?
Well, I think there's two things that's happening.
I think that they're too busy having affairs
and sleeping with people who aren't their husbands or wives,
and I think that they're too busy texting people
and accusing Trump of being involved in Russia
and all of this nonsense that we've seen taking place at the FBI over the past year or two.
But the thing that's more concerning and most disturbing to me, in my opinion,
is the fact that this is a pattern, right?
We see it with the Fort Hood shooter.
We saw it with the terrorists who shot up the gay club in Orlando.
We saw it with, you know, just San Bernardino, right?
You can go through this list of terrorists and mass shooters throughout the past year or two,
and the commonality is that they were all known by the FBI
prior to committing their attacks or acts of terrorism.
So I personally wonder if the FBI has some type of benefit,
being the propaganda arm for the Democratic Party that they have become
and proven themselves to be by not taking out these threats to society
so that when they do commit acts of violence with guns,
the Democrats can immediately politicize the tragedy and call for gun control,
even though the FBI is probably working hand-in-hand with the Democratic Party
as we've seen on more than just one issue besides, you know,
targeting Trump and committing treason against our commander-in-chief.
Laura Luma up there in Florida. Thank you for joining us.
Laura, this does seem to be part of a, I have a little saying on my show
that Alex Jones just keeps getting proven right to the consternation
and confusion and fury of liberals everywhere, whether it's gay frogs
and it turns out actually amphibians do go trans or agender
with particular chemicals in the water.
Daily Mail reported that, and I mentioned that last time I was on this show.
Or it's the skepticism with which he has always regarded the intelligence community.
Now it seems that that healthy sense of critical distance is rippling out among the public at large.
It seems to me that the big trend of 2018, the red thread running through this year's news reports
and the big development is not going to be me too or Hollywood, but rather
an increasing skepticism and even hatred of our own intelligence agencies,
which is going to make America a very difficult place to govern
and a very dangerous place to live.
877-789-2539, if you want to talk to me after the segment,
show is almost over today. I'm sorry to tell you, we're running out of time.
Call us if you want to be on the phones.
We're going to be right back after a few commercial messages taking your calls on any subject you like.
We'll be right back.
Frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglenone to it,
which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
It is amazing.
Redpilt, now available at infowarstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
Matt and Ohio, you're on the air. Another Matt, go ahead.
Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars,
and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic,
and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me,
and it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, infowars.com on the right arm.
I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt.
Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign in the infowars.com on the back.
That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at infowars.com.
InfoWars.com is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
This is pollen block.
In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms
experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
They began studying the effects in their published trials.
Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress,
and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block, available now at infowarslife.com.
Until three, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife after years of research on the human microbiome.
Not all probiotics are made the same.
Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
That's infowarslife.com.

Last segment of the last hour of the show.
You'll be just as miserable that I am that is coming to an end.
And before we take calls, I've got time for a couple of calls.
Let me remind you about infowarslife's IQRIN.
Here we go. The best endorsement I can give you, because I'm very careful about what I put inside myself.
As many... I won't make that joke, actually. We go out on the radio, don't we?
Oh, let's do it. There we go. Milk-fissile extract, 600 milligrams of it.
More toxins and diseases find their way into your system.
More important is that your body's detox systems can keep up.
And the liver and the kidneys are the ones who bear the brunt of all of your smoking, drinking, and carousing.
Terrible things that you people do to your bodies while you're listening to infowars.
I'm going down Jim Bean and chain-smoking.
Well, you can help recover from all of that with some milk-fissile extracts and in-acetylcysteine.
Some amla fruit, bupallurium root, licorice root.
I had to check, because I thought they were making these up, because they didn't sound like real things to me,
but I've looked them up and they are.
It's like when you get the yoga hobbyists who will talk to you about acciberries and bebinga roots and things.
They are real things.
Liver and kidneys, take care of you, so take care of them.
Icurin, it's a formula that can support your liver, including your body, dangerous toxins, and so on and so forth.
Powerful set of ingredients, including milk-fissile extract, a clinically studied herbal ingredient,
proven to support liver function in the body with a complete 30-day liver cleanse.
Pick up one of these, I'll do it myself, and I'll report back and let you know how I got on.
This is the Alex Jones Show on InfoWars. I'm Ali Anopoulos, standing in for Alex Jones in this last segment.
Thank you to everybody who called in.
We are going to go straight to Joe, who is on the line now, wants to talk to us about...
What is it you want to talk to us about, Joe? I can't remember.
SSRI?
Ah, yes. Perfect.
Drugging our young boys.
Welcome to the show. Thank you so much for calling. How can we help you?
Yes, sir. I've been listening to the show for a couple of years now.
It's definitely got me woke.
I do want to say that being active-duty military, we get forced to drink a lot of water.
Yes.
And drinking fluoridated water has definitely had an impact on my health,
but as soon as I switched to the Alexa Pure, I've got two of them right now,
and I've never felt better.
My water is very pure. It makes your whole body feel good,
and I'm a big fan of all the InfoWars Life products.
I have tried the carnivore, the whey protein, the brain force, definitely the X2,
and I've never run into a product that I had any problems with
or was not very, very high standard.
Well, there we go. It's a much higher and more powerful
and more persuasive endorsement than mine.
There we go. Active duty. Thank you very much for that.
Talk to us about... We're running out of time in this final segment,
so talk to us a little bit about drugging kids.
I'll try to be quick, sir.
Thank you.
You are all a big fan of yours, my work center.
Thank you.
So you've got all these mass shootings,
and every single time there's a common threat, it's SSRI.
But nobody with any power is trying to change this except the right.
The left is more than happy to let this continue
and let all the drugged out people eventually snap,
which is what these drugs are doing.
It does seem to be the case, doesn't it?
It's the case that these drugs are having unforeseen effects on young men
who at some point suddenly start losing it a little bit
and commit these terrible acts.
You must have noticed from being in the armed forces
this culture-wide suppression and demonization of masculinity.
Masculinity being that essential quality that not only keeps us safe,
that is essential to the proper functioning of the armed forces
of law enforcement and everything else,
but it drives us to excel, drives us to explore, drives us to invent,
properly channeled and respected and appreciated and enjoyed.
Men are wonderful and men and women different, complementary,
equally fantastic in their own ways.
You must be frustrated with the constant demonization of men in culture
and it finds its highest expression in the hatred of the military
and of law enforcement from the left.
Have you seen that happen over the last few years?
You're constantly bashing the very men who keep us safe.
Yeah, there's definitely, I think, this demonization of the manly cut figure.
You know, the old-fashioned kind of Clint Eastwood,
just strong, tough, strong, silent type.
You don't see that anymore.
And if you're like that, the left and the liberal demonize it.
Like, it's a thing of the past. It's a dinosaur.
They want it to die so that we can open the borders
and bring in Islamic radical terrorists
and we can throw our Second Amendment down the drain
and be completely disarmed when the government goes full 1984
and wants to infringe on our very rights that the founding fathers gave us.
And they always want to throw up this argument saying,
oh, yeah, well, they had muskets. They had muskets.
Well, yeah, they didn't have automatic weapons.
Well, we don't have automatic weapons.
And you know, if you're a woman in a Chicago or a Detroit or a St. Louis suburb
and you're worried about getting raped or mugged or attacked or whatever,
you want a pistol in your handbag. Let me tell you,
if you are somebody living in one of those areas
or if you just are a patriot who is worried about the tyranny of government,
which is a sincere opinion held by 100 million Americans
that liberals seem to find ridiculous,
this is just as emotional as it is a rational argument
for supporters of the Second Amendment, perfectly reasonable.
Thank you for your call, Joe. Sorry we don't have more time,
but thank you very much for calling in.
Thank you for the compliments.
Thank you for the endorsement of the products.
There we go.
Somebody out there fighting for your freedoms is a fan of InfoWarsStore.com.
Moving swiftly on to Scott, who wants to talk to us about the trans issue,
I think Scott, are you there?
Yes, I'm here.
How are you doing, Pumpkin?
Oh, good. And I really enjoyed listening to you. You're great.
Oh, well, thank you.
And so anyway, I went through a sex resignment surgery from male to female.
And I got tired of being called to be from hell,
so I went back to my birth name and went back to male.
Oh, wow. So you went there and back again, as Tolkien would say.
You are an example of what I've seen increasing number of studies show,
which is the regret rates for transition surgery, for reassignment surgery,
are remarkably high.
What is it you'd like to say to people who are out there defending teachers
and educators and scientists who want to put kids on hormone blockers
and talk about removing the genitalia of young boys?
What would you say, just quickly, because we've got to run.
I would love to have spoken to you for longer,
but we've got to run to the next call.
What would you say to those teachers, to the journalists, to the scientists,
all these people who are advocating for this treatment and pathologizing of young boys?
What would you tell them?
Don't do it.
I'm 59 years old.
I've got the bone structure of a 90-year-old because of lack of hormones in my body.
And the other thing is, as far as the issue with the school shootings and whatnot,
and I am a staunch conservative, just like you,
and we need to arm up our teachers.
Absolutely.
Thank you for the call.
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry we didn't have more time.
I'm very grateful for your calling.
Thank you.
Finally, Lauren is a regular caller.
We have literally 60 seconds.
Lauren, thank you so much for calling in.
Welcome.
Thank you for calling.
I know you're a regular caller, so people are going to get to hear from you again.
I'm so sorry we're incredibly short of time.
Give us your quick 60 seconds of wisdom.
60 seconds I can do it.
I'll stick with the school situation.
I ran for state school board.
I was there.
I watched them.
They are dumbing down your children on purpose.
You know, deliberate dumbing down Charlotte Isherby.
And none of this would be happening.
How do you have three generations of lefties that don't understand guns is what made this country free?
Absolutely.
It's only been 200 years.
You really don't understand that you need to defend yourself.
Are you kidding me?
Are you suggesting, Lauren, that evidence, fact, reason, logic and history have no effect on social justice warriors?
You do surprise me.
This is your fault.
It's not the congressman that's going to save you.
It's moms and dads with common sense who decide they don't want to throw their children into this garbage pit.
It's your own fault, your own fix.
If you want your children to be upright, constructive, moral, productive, these are things that are taught and they're not being taught in the school.
Amen.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Lauren.
And thank you for the calls.
Sorry, we don't have more time.
Well, we didn't get to any of the things.
Well, actually, we got to some of the things I want to do.
We got to one thing that we might return to tomorrow.
Yes, that's right.
I'll be back tomorrow.
This is Michael Moore showing up to a Russia funded anti-Trump protest.
You couldn't make it up.
Literally, you couldn't make it up.
I'm Arlene Opless and you have been watching the Alex Jones show.
I'll be back again tomorrow.
You can find me at dangerous.com.
My pink flushed info wars studio will return tomorrow.
Thank you so much for watching.
Thank you for your freedoms.
Thank you for being watches.
You're great.
I love you.
See you tomorrow.
Have a great night.
Thanks for watching.
Take action now before we sell out.
You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from infowarslife.com.
But instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
From all the life's tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there.
And it's amazing.

And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
