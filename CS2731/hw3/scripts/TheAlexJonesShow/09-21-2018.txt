We're now only 46 days away from the most important election in world history.
All the roads lead together at this great crossroads and the globalists, the Chinese
Communists, the unelected dictatorial EU, the America-hating Hollywood, and the coastal
elites are hell-bent on driving the populist awakening into the sea.
That's not going to happen.
As long as those of us on the cutting edge of the fight stay the course.
Don't falter and don't waver and realize it's a great honor to be in the middle of history
taking place.
No, ladies and gentlemen, we're not watching science fiction adventure movies with super
action heroes.
We are the men and women that will decide the human destiny.
Will the Tim Cooks and other tyrants of the planet enslave us?
Are we crap like they think we are or will we transcend their attempt at massive social
conditioning and human depopulation on terra firma?
We have massive breaking news for you, ladies and gentlemen, and we knew that this was coming
because the Soros Group, the Group C Funds, the Democratic Party, and U.S. Democrat Senators
have all called for M4s to be completely shut down in congressional hearings, 100% authoritarianism,
the likes of which you saw in Nazi Germany or Communist China today.
And stuff like this happens in Venezuela, it's big national news here.
Well, the Democrats do it, it's part of the course.
You've got Governor Jerry Brown saying they need to basically kill the president.
You've got Maxine Waters a few days ago, he played the clip saying it's time to knock
him off.
It means kill somebody, that's the definition of knocking somebody off.
It's first definition in Webster means to kill.
So they are heating up and realize that our champion Trump is in the front lines battling
as hard as he can.
In fact, I went through all 200 articles with the one I don't have is the one about Trump
rescinds.
If I could have that, please, the declassification of the fake Russiagate documents.
He didn't actually really do that.
It's posted on inforwars.com.
What he said was like the JFK documents, he said release them and they said, okay, we
want to redact a few areas.
He said, fine, he went and had the inspector general check it, the same things happening
yet again.
But we need to get these out way before the election.
These are bombshell between Comey and the rest of them.
There it is.
Trump walks back his plan to declassify Russia probe documents.
That's the same headline RT has.
You know, RT is getting worse and worse and worse.
Pull up the RT headline.
It's the same stupid headline.
The RT's mainstream media, especially RT America.
Now, obviously the big news here, PayPal.
We got a call from our PayPal rep that we've been with PayPal 20 years and millions of
dollars a year goes through there.
And they tried to get us to a meeting a few weeks ago and wanted all of our other processes
and all our other companies are financial data.
And I told Tim, I said, don't go to that.
I said, they're getting ready to ban us.
I see right wing watch and the people from American Way and Soros calling for it to be
shut down.
They want a blueprint to try to harass everybody in my opinion.
And sure enough, he got the call yesterday from one of the reps saying, oh, we need to
talk to you tomorrow in a big meeting to let you know what's going to happen.
And he said, oh, you're going to ban us.
And they said, well, how do you know?
He goes, you better get your boss on the line.
So we got a senior person on.
We recorded them as well.
Tim did.
I may release the audio with the transcripts and article and infowars.com.
And what they're doing now is giving a story to all the mainstream corporate media.
And then they can release it at, I'd say, seven o'clock tonight.
That's the formula like when Apple banned our number one app, number one on News, a couple
million downloads since it came out two months ago.
When they banned you being able to download that, you still have it on your phone.
It's still there.
It was released at seven o'clock on a Friday night.
They find it the best time to bury something.
So we're getting the jump on them today.
Old exclusive PayPal bans, M4s that were lobbying by Soros Funding Group.
And I just decided I'm going to upload the five minute phone conversation to the site
as well.
So you can hear that for yourself.
So pretty incredible.
It's all coming up straight ahead.
This is next level authoritarianism.
It's Mark of the Beast denying people from commerce.
Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
to unhealthy levels.
To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
in the rainwater.
Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
It's Friday, September 21, 2018.
I'm your host Alex Jones and I was going to take off today because my 10-year-old daughter
particularly wanted me to let her play hooky.
She loves it when it's raining outside.
It's been raining trenchly.
She wanted to go around the green belt with a little hammer.
I got her like five years ago for finding fossils, a little geology hammer.
She wanted to go dig fossils in the rings.
That's a good time to go to the alluvial plain here in Austin, Texas.
There's an old extinct volcano we like to go out to and she finds quartz crystals and
things like that.
They're pretty spectacular fossils.
In fact, one of the places we've gone, they've found plesiosars and t-rexes.
You name it.
So she just loves it.
We go out and walk a few miles off into the woods, up to some creeks where nobody ever
goes and really finds some neat things, but I'm not here with her.
I am in this studio, ladies and gentlemen, so I'm not there with her.
I am here for a big reason, a very, very big reason.
We have seen the Democratic Party, foreign multinational corporations, the Communist
Chinese, George Soros, the famous currency speculator that's brought down over 20 nations,
the Hollywood media combine, all trying to destroy me.
Build me up as this demon, sue me, attack me, go after all our platforms to silence us
to really start the defamation.
Instead of the assassination, first they assassinate the character, then they assassinate a little
bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more until you basically are dead even
though you're still alive.
That's how they do it in the 21st century.
And so we knew when I was talking to White House sources and campaign sources and others,
and you heard Mike Cernovich on here a few months ago when they first banned me, he said,
listen, the big thing they're gonna go after is PayPal and credit card processors harassing
them.
And that's the group that Van Jones still heads up in a U.S. government office that
Trump hasn't even gotten rid of yet because there's such a mutiny against Trump, he can't
even get hardly anything done.
Despite that, he turned the wheel a few degrees and things have gotten much, much better right
away.
So the final thing that a tyrant does, whether you're Adolf Hitler or whether you're Joseph
Stalin or whether you're VI Lenin or whether you're Mao Zedong or whether you're Pol Pot
or whether you are Fidel Castro or whether you're Hugo Chavez or whether you are Julius
Caesar, is you have money that only you stamp an issue and then you can actually ban certain
people through licensure from being able to even engage in commerce.
And so America was founded about getting away from, if you weren't a British Lord, you couldn't
be in business.
Well, America was really founded over business and over the fact that better men weren't allowed
to set up shop or have a factory or any other service you can imagine if they weren't working
under some inbred, mentally retarded British Lord.
And so people were really sick of that royal licensure situation.
But if you actually read the writings of our founders, that was why.
That's why we had the war.
Wasn't over a t-tax.
So it's happening again and Hitler first grabbed political groups he didn't like, Jews and
many others and put them in ghettos and said, you're not allowed to engage in commerce.
First they demonized groups, then they started cutting off their banking, then their commerce,
then their shops.
Right, it was about crystal knot, all the rest of it, and that's been done by the Communist
in Russia.
It was done by the Maoist in China.
This is an exact formulae.
You would have the big oil companies and the big robber baron railroads in famous cases
in Colorado and the Dakotas and California, where you'd have towns of 300, 400, 500 people
that actually own the land, had the title, but the railroad wanted to come through it
and wanted the gold or oil, and they'd sit in Pinkerton security in famous cases and
kill hundreds of men, women and children in Colorado, you name it, there's famous cases
of Pinkerton massacres in the last century.
In the last century, in the 20th century, not the 21st century, 1920s, 30s, you name
it, they were still coming into towns and killing everybody, riding toddlers down on
horseback just running over babies.
That's what they did.
They'd pull up with wagons with gatling guns, and just, just kill everybody.
So, we've been through this before.
All right, this is the same crap, different, you know what?
And it's all being done high tech behind this wall of internet largesse by the so-called
tech titans and the techies, and they think we're stupid.
And because we've pioneered the fact that Google broke its search engine two years ago,
we use it constantly.
We know.
Because we pioneered the Communist Chinese social score coming to America five years
ago, three years before anybody else reported on it.
Because in thousands of cases, we break the story first that Google filed a patent 20 years
ago to start watching and listening to you over computers.
Or that Samsung filed a patent 10 years ago and told users six years ago.
They know we know what we're doing.
So they want us shut down.
They want us silenced in a big, big way.
And so it happened.
And at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to read this entire Paul Joseph Watson article
that I also contributed to, Bombshell PayPal Bands Info Wars for Lobbying by Soros Funded
Group.
And Bezos Lobby, to the Washington Post, have a shutdown.
Act, porches interference, interfering in business, racketeering, you name it, to have
Amazon, the biggest retailer in the world, through the Washington Post article after
article, calling for me to be shut down in my shopping cart to be shut down.
That is incredibly criminal.
But that's Jeff Bezos.
So that's where this is all going.
And I've talked to all the law firms.
We 1 million percent have winning lawsuits here.
It'll take years to win.
By then, it'll all be sewed up and we'll be under an authoritarian regime.
Again, there we are months ago pointing out Google search engines broken.
If you're looking on TV, real.video, our YouTube video was related to that.
And we break every bit of it down for you.
We prove it all.
And now that term's everywhere.
Google is broken.
Whether you do a search engine about bad reactions from measles shots or you want the drug insert
for the new meningitis shot where the own insert says it kills about 1% of people that
take it and sterilizes people.
That doesn't come up now.
PR and BS comes up.
So it's not broken.
It's a giant fraud.
What you do is you internally advertise if you're a Fortune 500 company with Google and
all they do is put your search results on top, not as an ad at the top.
All the search results, hundreds of pages of it.
That's coming out.
We're going to be playing, dealing with all of that.
So they're making their move into commerce now to block us.
Now, here's the thing, PayPal told us that we have 10 days to get off their platform
entirely.
They've already taken our ability to advertise on Google.
They've already taken us off AdRoll.
They've already taken us off Credio.
They've already are going after all our other systems and people go, oh, it's a free country
with their corporations.
The Democrats are directing it.
They're working with these leftist attack dog groups that are foreign funded and Soros
funded and this is just criminal bullying that's going on.
It's totally on its face, racketeering, not just a monopoly, but government involved with
the monopolies to do this.
And Congress and the president must and will be acting very, very soon.
But talking to White House sources and others, they said, Alex, your problem is not going
to be being banned off these platforms.
They're coming after the NRA, everybody's able to process money.
And they said they're going to even do it to average conservatives.
That's the word from the Democrats, a reign of terror if they get into office.
So if they ever get control of the House or the Senate or the presidency, they're going
pure authoritarian.
The good news is the White House knows that.
But as a little protest, I think a lot of people should delete PayPal.
They're famous for keeping your money of your emergent and scams.
Or you can dump out of your PayPal wallet before you delete it at infowarstore.com to
get a water filter, an air filter to get great t-shirts, books, films, our great supplements.
Go make a huge purchase to let us get a good signal that you want us to go forward against
this.
We're not going to back down.
I'm going to fight, keep swinging to the end.
It looks like we're going to win.
Now, they had that big article this week, Alex Jones is winning the Info War.
That really pissed him off, showing our numbers are way up.
Well, actually you're winning the Info War by standing up these bullets, but now is
the big test.
Alright, there's a lot of other news coming up as well, but this is next level, folks.
Please spread the live links right now.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out and I think it's going to be the same way with
this fiber, get yours today InfowarsLife.com.
all I can say is Trump is on fire, ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna be getting
more into the fact that the media spinning it that he is not going to release the secret
documents of the FBI, deputy director and Comey and others trying to set the presidency
up and trying to derail the candidacy as well.
Now he's going to release it, he's allowing a review by the inspector general, he's been
a lot more trustworthy than the attorney general, making sure there's no classified information
that hurts any innocent people but does expose the crooks that are involved.
But getting back to this bombshell information and it is bombshell, the Democrats are seeking
to go after individuals right to commerce and jobs.
They call it a global communist Chinese social score where everything you do political or
in life is put into a database by the big tech giants and by government and then they
start restricting your access to fly on planes, to travel, to buy, to sell, this is the plan.
In fact, Google and Apple and Facebook in the last month have announced they're going
to have trust scores for people that use Google, Facebook or Apple.
Remember the Nazis were bad for putting pink triangles on people and stars of David's on
others, this is a total control system.
So here's some of the headlines on this front that just tie into this bombshell PayPal bans
info wars after lobbying by Soros funded group, that's the big article on info wars.com that's
so critical to get out.
Here's another one, the end finally comes for Alex Jones, the Atlantic Monthly, that's
the left CIA, big tech censors Alex Jones, what's next, ban the app and then it goes
into Alex Jones' service by PayPal despite obvious terms of service violations and they
told us over the phone, they said, does it matter that what you're saying politically
that we call hate speech subjectively on your news websites, isn't on your shopping cart,
we're banning this because of who you are, unbelievable discrimination beyond not letting
people eat at lunch counters because the color of their skin, which was terrible.
They're saying I have access to no digital lunch counters and then it goes on, Alex
Jones rails against big tech, his info were stores still thrive.
That's the Washington Post on my Jeff Bezos calling for me to be shut down just a few
weeks ago and now it's happened.
Oh, look, George Soros stock up on PayPal stocks.
PayPal confirms that it's buying payments and startup iZettle for $2.2 billion in all cash
deal.
I think the president should block that for antitrust purposes because now they're going
to have with Soros a global manipulation into all these major markets and be able to sit
there and censor other people and other nations need to block the PayPal iZettle deal.
Everyone needs to call Congress.
Then you read this, a new color of censorship from the SPLC American greatness.
There's still this office of diversity still running the government by Van Jones.
They then came out and called David Horowitz this year a Nazi, actually say white supremacists.
He's a Israel first Jew, blood money, color of change, smear campaign seeks to shut down
the fundraising abilities of conservative organizations by pressuring credit card companies and payment
processors and I access the conservative groups, black listed by the Southern Poverty
Law Center, color of change, falsely accused all these groups of promoting violence and
white supremacy.
They had to then remove the ban against Horowitz because calling the American Jew a Nazi didn't
fly too well.
WikiLeaks Icelandic court battle against Visa for blocking donations.
They won.
Operation payback was a huge response, taking down Visa and MasterCard for blocking a signs.
I'm not calling for the hacking community to do that.
I'm simply saying this.
I have stood up for WikiLeaks and to believe in what they've done, even if I disagree and
I believe in their free speech and I believe in the power of the press to get secret documents
and to cover them and I think WikiLeaks has been very judicious about not releasing things
that hurt sovereign nations or individuals but expose criminal activity.
They have built a strong man against me, the globalist have.
They have demonized and assassinated my character.
Now they're assassinating our ability to even respond back on hundreds of platforms that
we've been banned from, 30 plus major tech platforms and they are now moving in for the
kill to cut us off from even receiving money from people that buy high quality products
at m4store.com.
So I'm asking for WikiLeaks.
I'm asking for the people that support WikiLeaks help.
When I had the petition that we sent to Trump to pardon Assange, I was told by high level
sources that was part of the calculus that went into having me de-platformed six weeks
ago.
Assange is a hero.
So I defend Assange even though they built strong men about him that aren't true.
They built strong men about me that aren't true.
I need to be defended now not by just this audience but by all the white-hot hackers
and by everyone else that understands what's happening.
I have dutifully stood the test of time and not back down from incredible demonization.
The media trying to have my children taken away from me, death threats, all of it.
And I'm asking all of you that stand for free speech and for justice, stand with us.
And I also ask PayPal to reconsider what they've done.
Now let me do this just briefly because here we are under financial attack.
We have other systems where you can buy high quality products via creditcard at m4store.com.
A lot of people choose to use PayPal and it will be crippling to say the least because
a lot of folks only use PayPal.
We still have PayPal for 10 days.
You can go there and make a substantive purchase of great products you already need as a message
to the globalist.
You're not going to put up with their garbage.
And I'm going to use this as a gauge of how serious you are about me going 110 percent.
Because I'm not going to back down but if we see major capital come in, I'll continue
our expansion operations.
If I don't see that, I don't want to stop expanding but we're going to have to start
contracting and that will only hasten blood in the water in our destruction and then that
means your destruction.
So I need everybody to go to m4store.com and get X2 the last run of the amazing good halogen.
Find out about the iodine conspiracy, the halogen conspiracy, the fluoride conspiracy.
It's still 25 percent off but it's got to end this weekend.
No excuses.
Super male vitality, incredible.
And super female vitality, compounded, cold pressed, concentrated herbs, then aged in
a proprietary process, thousands of five star reviews.
It's 50 percent off and it's our last run too.
Because here's the thing, these are super high quality formulas and the price, it costs
us a lot and in the position we're in, we can't even sit there and pay the prices for
these anymore and that's the point we've gotten down to and the enemy knows that.
They've got us under surveillance.
So if you want super male vitality, if you want X2, now is the time m4store.com, m4slife.com
or triple-A 253-3139 and we're here asking for your help.
We appreciate you.
We honor you.
We appreciate everything you've done already.
But this really is epic history taking place.
We really have changed the world with your help.
We really have relaunched Americana.
We really have exposed the global government.
It really is on the run worldwide but still has the power and the infrastructure and the
beast system.
And if you will financially stand with us, it will do incredible things.
But I need to see a major move at m4store.com, t-shirts, books, films, sign up for auto
ship, get an additional 10% off.
It's all there and why you still can use PayPal.
Dump out that PayPal wallet at m4store.com as a strong message and then cancel it.
They've backed off before but this isn't just kicking somebody off YouTube or Facebook.
This is saying you've been with us 20 years.
You've done tens of millions of dollars in business through our thing and now we're
going to shut you down because Soros bought our company.

X2, we were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was and
how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this
and that.
And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary
ingredient that goes in X2 that literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker
dish on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I dream of genie in this, it's purple
gas.
I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down, and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm
done, I'm breaking the contract, but I broke the contract last week.
And so this is potentially the last run, in fact, right now it is the last run, which
is Bible Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it, but it'll be gone in a couple
months.
X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowarstore.com, if you have experienced it, I suggest you
stock up on it.
It's available right now for a limited time, infowarstore.com, it's 25% off right now.

Don't write in starlight, because the words might come out real.
Don't dance in darkness.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
We are the Infowar.
And I'm quite cheerful, to be under massive persecution by the devil-worshipping, child-molesting,
communist-loving, God-hating New World Order.
Because when they're done, their whole world government's going to come crashing down,
and they're going to be crowned from the Communist Chinese, and Tim Cook, and Apple, King, nothing!
All right.
We've got so much coming up next hour, the latest on Cabinon, the just insane stuff
going on, that we're going to be breaking down in great detail.
But first off, let's get into the central situation that's happening.
The move to take the NRA, and every other gun shop, and every other hunting supply shop,
right to have a bank account or process credit cards.
It's Mark of the Beast, Isle of Patmos, John the Revelator, if you don't even believe
in God, the point is, imagine what Hitler would have done with the casual society.
And so, Google and Facebook, now once you're banking info to be on Facebook, and they want
to tie it all in this big race, and they want you to put little spies in your home, like
Alexa and, you know, the Google Home Assistant, and I see TV ads where the wife's gone and
the husband's there.
But the little Google Assistant tells the husband he's good in a woman's voice.
This is so sick.
These are big, ruthless corporations that we've trusted with everything.
And I've got stacks of news just today, where they're taking advantage of that.
Like Zuckerberg said, our users trust us.
What dumb efforts.
Google employees corrupted their own search engine to propagandize the millions.
We're going to play that clip from Tucker Carlson coming up.
I know you heard this a long time ago here, but now it's coming out.
Google workers discussed tweaking search function to counter travel ban.
Yeah, don't criticize radical Islam.
Apple gives you a trust rating based on your phone call and email habits.
Oh, Tim Cook's tracking everything you do.
Now, don't track what he does.
He supports Communist China.
Google admits it still allows apps to access your Gmail.
That's right.
Why not?
They even refuse to testify to Congress.
They do whatever they want, whenever they want, because they think you're an idiot.
But then there's a talk show host talking about all this and warning people and warning
the president.
We got to kick him off all these platforms where he's popular.
We got to defame him and lie about him.
And then we've got to completely remove him from the internet period, and then we can't
let him even sell books or videos or supplements.
We have to fully shut him down.
And then of course, once they're able to do that, what do you think happens after that
point?
Everyone else?
In fact, can you guys put behind me?
I wanted to do this.
It's the new Americans' current cover of their magazine, Alex Jones Censored.
And it says, first, Alex Jones was censored.
Who's next?
It's a pretty powerful cover.
I think Marley tweeted it out last night.
I meant to tell you guys, start of the show, maybe next segment, we'll have that and put
it behind me.
But right now, let's go ahead and go into this bombshell, PayPal bans info wars after
lobbying by Soros funded group, the Democrats and more payment processor terminates agreements
citing hate and intolerance, a perfectly nebulous subjective term.
You think teaching five year olds, they're another sex and trying to put them on sterilization
drugs is hateful.
You're banned.
The Islam throwing gave people off buildings and the government supporting it's wrong.
You're banned.
You think you should have your own first amendment, you're banned.
Payment processor PayPal has banned info wars and what represents nothing less than a political
ploy designed to financially sabotage and influential media outlet just weeks ahead
of the midterm elections.
Company representatives called info wars our city confirmed that PayPal was terminating
its agreement after a comprehensive review of the info wars site, which is not even the
shopping cart.
The company claim that info wars violated PayPal's acceptable use policy because it
promoted hate and discriminatory intolerance in certain communities and religions.
No specific examples whatsoever were officially provided to back up the claim, which relies
on the nebulous definition of hate, which is so vague that it virtually anything could
qualify.
And the one thing I asked Paul, they had the article he did and we're going to do another
article.
Maybe I've kept Daniels or Don do it or somebody else.
I don't want Lucifer kind of be taken off or nation of Islam.
I don't even want the Palestinians to be taken off the Muslim brotherhood.
That's a terror group or care.
They've all got their PayPal.
They've all got their Facebook and YouTube.
I don't.
And these are groups, you know, saying Jews are the devil and things that I don't agree
with, but they have a right to say it.
Homosexuality is punishable by death and all those other stuff, but I'm not saying that
I'm banned.
They're not because there's an open door to Islam in this larger globalist plan.
So we need to have a whole other article about PayPal bans Jones for hate won't just define
it, but then leaves groups funding terrorist up off records.
Info wars was told that criticism of Islam and opposition to transgenderism being taught
that children in school were the two examples of hate.
The man was instituted that despite info wars store.com containing no political content
whatsoever, emphasizing how the decision was a broader attack on info wars platform.
And they admit that you're being shut down because of what you do on other websites.
PayPal represents said they were given info wars, 10 days to switch payment processors
after which all services would be terminated.
The ban was handed down just weeks after George Soros funded group right wing watch.
By the way, George Soros has bought controlling interest in PayPal, I should tell you.
So it's now Soros, pal.
That's right.
If you have a PayPal account, you are now Soros, pal.
The ban was handed down just weeks after George Soros funded group right wing watch published
an article demanding the PayPal terminated agreement with info wars for egregious violations,
the platform's own terms of service.
The gang of leftist Soros funded Nazi collaborator thugs come down the street saying we're going
to burn you down politically if you don't ban him and they just put their head between
their legs and kiss their ass goodbye.
Right wing watch routinely violates copyright by opening entire sections of people's videos
on YouTube without any pretense of fair use yet the group's channel has not been deleted
because they're the ruling class.
Right wing watch is owned by People of the American Way which is funded by George Soros
Open Society Institute which is being banned in Europe.
In addition, the Jeff Bezos own Washington Post published an article less than two weeks
ago that serve as a dog whistle for PayPal to ban info wars.
Well, they actually said banning entitled, as Alex Jones ran against big tech, his info
wars stores still thrive online.
The article bemoaned the fact that despite Alex Jones being taken off every other big
tech platform, censorship had left intact key elements of his money making machinery
and digital storefronts, gotta blow that up.
The article then specifically mentions how info wars uses PayPal to generate a high rate
of sales and had CIA funded university professors detailing all the traffic and how to shut
it down.
And that's Obama and the stay behind network he has in the CIA and the Justice Department.
Yet another example of a competing media outlet abusing its dominant position to lobby to shut
down a smaller media outlet, PayPal banning info wars is the ultimate culmination of what
represents a de facto communist Chinese style social credit score where first you demonize
then censor before you basically destroy the ability to operate in the marketplace and
starve people to death.
Yes, from the gulag to the death camp.
We're now in the gulag folks.
The decision is also blatantly political given the fact that midterms are just 45 and a half
days away.
The crusade to ban Alex Jones and info wars from a myriad of other platforms was amplified
by Democratic Congressman Ted Deutsch, who demanded we have links to it all to know why
Facebook and YouTube hadn't banned Jones, both companies complied with Germany's demand
within weeks.
See Obama is still in office, according to them along with Hillary and the leader in
the government is Senator Warner.
So this little creature is just giving orders saying ban him where the government from
so legitimate he'll be gone soon and moving forward with this.
We'll finish up with this article straight ahead and then play Tucker Carlson, incredible
patron that he is exposing the whole thing straight ahead info wars dot com news wars
dot com.
You realize that we're like the Alamo here.
I mean, we're fighting hard, no matter what happens, we went in the end.
We knew it was coming.
The whole thing was for me like first demonize info wars lie about us, build a straw man
then sue us to add credibility to that.
Then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying
children and Islamophobia.
And then walla two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms
where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds go to info wars dot com forward
slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing
to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
It's also critical to go to info wars dot com forward slash newsletter and give us your
emails so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our
own platform.
But whatever you do, tell folks about info wars dot com forward slash show how they can
download the free Android and iPhone apps how they can then reach out to others with
the information and point out this is the verboten info.
This is what they don't want you to see.

about three years and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying, and they said,

now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2 that literally is so pure that

the last run. In fact, right now it is the last run, which is Vybel Shield X2, and we've got a
good supply of it. It'll be gone a couple of months. X2, if you haven't experienced it,
infowarstore.com, if you have experienced it, I suggest you stop up on it. It's available
right now for a limited time. Infowars.com is 25% off right now.
This is getting totally out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, before I start going into this New York Times story that just broke
Redlinked and Siren on Drudge headline, Rosenstein suggested he secretly record
Trump and discussed 25th Amendment. I'm going to read this whole article in the next two segments.
Rosenstein has already come out and denied this, so think about that. They can't even figure out
their own coup right now. They're so out of control. They can't even get their coup against America
straight because there's so many different angles and attempts to destroy this country.
But before I go into this article, here's what people need to understand.
This is not a political talk show talking point. This is not some political talk show narrative.
This is not for your entertainment. This is not me coming up with smoke billowing out of my ears
for you to laugh and point and cry and agree or whatever.
This is an unelected group of people inside the government, inside unelected bureaucracies
that are attempting a coup against the president of the United States. But it's not just the
president of the United States. It's against you. They believe they decide this country's fate.
They believe they decide who the president is. They decided it was Hillary Clinton.
We, the people, decided it was Donald Trump. So they decided they were going to remove Donald
Trump and stop us from having any Democratic Republic whatsoever. That's the story here,
folks. That's what needs to sink in. This is beyond Donald Trump. This is about a deep state.
This is about a shadow government. This is about crime at the highest levels, if not bordering on
treason, straight up treason, being committed by a shadow government, a coup against America,
where we elect a president and they say no. We put a Supreme Court justice in via our president and
they say no. Are you going to let a couple elites inside a shadow government that they even admit
now in the New York Times exist? Are you going to let them control your life? Are you going to let
them steal your vote? That's what they're doing, folks. That's what they're doing. They are trying
to steal your vote. And I'm going to tell you something here. They already rigged these elections,
folks. The will of the American people is so against the deep state right now. It's not even close.
If you had a fair election right now, and every single American, almost 330 million,
if you had a real election not rigged, a real election right now, 330 million Americans, 300,
I bet you 250 million Americans would support Trump and support his agenda right now.
But what do you have? 20 to 30 people inside a shadow government and operating from outside,
like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, trying to dictate this country using their propaganda
wings of television news like CNN, MSNBC, using their propaganda wings of press like Washington
Post and New York Times, using their propaganda wings of entertainment like the NFL and Hollywood,
the NFL and Hollywood to try to act like those 30 people that want to run your life or the minority
when it's a tiny few elite that are trying to destroy this country and destroy our Democratic
Republic. That's what you need to understand. And they use all of their propaganda wings and the
optics to make you think that you're not winning, to make you think that we're not having an American
revolution. We are having such an American revolution right now. It's not even funny and
they're trying to do everything to stop you. They want you, you're basically a slave to these people.
You wouldn't vote for Donald Trump. Don't care. We're going to remove him from office. That's
what they think. Now, let me get into this story from the New York Times. It's Rosenstein has already
denied that he tried to set up the president from Adam Goldman and Michael Schmidt at the New York
Times just published headline. Rosenstein suggested he secretly record Trump and discussed 25th
Amendment. The deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein suggested last year that he secretly
record President Trump in the White House to expose the chaos consuming the administration.
And he discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr.
Trump from office for being unfit, for being unfit. No, that's for existing, for winning.
That's why they had to get him out because he won because we decided the country. We decided
the president. We wanted Trump. We didn't want Hillary Clinton. We decided that. They decided,
no, you don't get Trump. Mr. Rosenstein made these suggestions in the spring of 2017 when
Mr. Trump's firing of James Comey as FBI director plunged the White House into turmoil. Oh, but
who wrote the letter of recommendation to President Trump to fire James Comey? Who was that? Rod Rosenstein.
A self-fulfilling prophecy. You write the letter of recommendation to fire Comey. He fires Comey,
and then you launch an investigation into him firing Comey. That is Rod the Rat Rosenstein.
Over the ensuing days, the president divulged classified intelligence to Russians in the Oval
Office. What is that even talking about? And revelations emerged that Mr. Trump had asked Mr.
Comey to pledge loyalty and end an investigation into a senior aide, which we're about to get the
FISA documents on that, which is why they wrote this story as a soft release to say, oh, well,
yeah, this all happened in the FISA, and they were illegally spying, and they were all behind it,
and Obama was involved, and it was a setup from the beginning. But we did it because we had to
stop Trump who was unfit. We did it because Trump was so uncouth. We did it for America.
Total bull. They did this to defeat America. Mr. Rosenstein was just two weeks into his job. He
had begun overseeing the Russia investigation and played a key role in the president's dismissal
of Mr. Comey by writing a memo critical of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation,
or how about the fact he just shut it down after it came out she was guilty. But Mr.
Rosenstein was caught off guard when Mr. Trump cited the memo in the firing, and he began telling
people that he feared he had been used. This is unbelievable, this propaganda. Mr. Rosenstein
made the remarks about secretly recording Mr. Trump and about the 25th Amendment in meetings
and conversations with other Justice Department and FBI officials. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Rosenstein's
denying this. Somebody's lying. Several people described the episodes, several, insisting on
anonymity. I can't even pronounce it. To discuss internal deliberations, the people were briefed
either on the events themselves or on memos written by FBI officials, including Andrew McCabe,
disgraced, then the acting bureau director that documented Mr. Rosenstein's actions and comments.
Uh-oh. Oh. Now the deep state faces off against itself. None of Mr. Rosenstein's proposals
apparently came to fruition. It is not clear how determined he was about seeing them through,
though he did tell Mr. McCabe that he might be able to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions and
John Kelly. Oh. Then the Secretary of Homeland Security and now the White House Chief of Staff
to mount an effort to invoke the 25th Amendment. Oh. Now we know why people didn't want
Infowars to get on the President's desk. Now we know why Jeff Sessions is doing nothing.
Now we know why people had to stop headlines like President Trump be warned they're coming
at you with the 25th Amendment from getting to his desk. Oh. The deep state becomes a little
clearer now. Hi. I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
And now your host, Owen Troyer. All right, let's get right back into this New York Times article.
I'm going to finish that. And then there's new breaking news coming from Judicial Watch.
And then there's another development with the Kavanaugh situation. But let me go right back
into this story. The extreme suggestions show Mr. Rosenstein's state of mind and the disorienting
days that followed Mr. Comey's dismissal. Disorienting days, extreme suggestions.
Sitting in on Mr. Trump's interviews with prospective FBI directors and facing attacks
for his own role in Mr. Comey's firing, Mr. Rosenstein had an up-close view of the tumult,
the tumult. Yeah, yeah, again. So they're building this whole narrative up. This is them
coming out with the soft release of what we're about to find out in the FISA courts,
acting like the Trump administration is out of control and the Comey's firing was unjustified.
And Rosenstein is just trying to keep everything under control.
Mr. Rosenstein had an up-close view of the tumult. Mr. Rosenstein appeared conflicted,
regretful, and emotional, according to people who spoke with him at the time.
You know, I bet that has something to do with the crimes that these people are trying to cover up
more than anything. Mr. Rosenstein, however, has disputed this account. He says, I quote,
the New York Times story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. I will not further comment
on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department
and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this,
based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.
Oh, talk about cover your ass. So it actually looks like what may have happened here,
as we read on, and it becomes clear, actual patriots inside the FBI and the Department
of Justice are calling out Rosenstein and Sessions and the like for not just a dereliction of duty,
but in effect, a soft coup against the president of the United States and against the American will.
It goes on. Justice Department spokeswoman also provided a statement from a person who
was present when Mr. Rosenstein proposed wearing a wire, going undercover against the president
of the United States, folks. Like, just think about this. They have positioned themselves
against America. Like, they have taken the position against America wearing a wire to
go in and try to set the president up that we elected. The person who would not be named acknowledged
the remark, but said Mr. Rosenstein made it sarcastically. But according to others who
described his comments, Mr. Rosenstein not only confirmed that he was serious about the idea,
but also followed up by suggesting that other FBI officials who were interviewing to be the
bureau's director could also secretly record Mr. Trump. That's treason. You're going to jail.
You know, remember what Hillary Clinton said? It's a good thing. Someone like Trump didn't
get elected. And what did he say? Because you'd be in jail. President Trump. No, no, no. Look,
President Trump needs to hear this. President Trump, they will put a bullet in your head by
the year 2020 if you do not act now against these people. You need to fire up military tribunals.
You need to fire up independent investigations. You need to launch special counsel against
these people or they will kill you just like they did JFK. Believe it. Just like they try to do to
Reagan. Believe it, President. They are on a full bore mission to bring America down. They are on a
full bore mission in a coup against this Republic and your public enemy number one to them, President.
You're standing in their way. If they can't remove you with the 25th Amendment, 25th Amendment,
they'll remove you with death. You have to act now, President. You have to act now.
These people know no limits. They do spirit cookings. They fly to pedophile island.
They lie to try to keep a Supreme Court justice off the Supreme Court. You have to act now.
We need military. The West. Oh, man. Let me just go back to the article.
Mr. McCabe, who was later fired from the FBI, declined to comment. His memos have been turned
over to the special counsel investigating whether Trump associates conspired with Russia's election
interference, Robert S. Mueller, according to a lawyer from McCabe. Oh, great. So the records
of high treason against this country are going to the man who's engaged in high treason against
this country. Great. Yeah, that'll go real far. A set of those memos remained at the FBI at the
time of his departure in late January 2018. Lawyer Michael Bromwich said of his client,
he has no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos. Oh, you mean the
deep state leaks? Wow, shocking. Oh, to the New York Times even? Oh, even more shocking.
The revelations about Mr. Rosenstein come as Mr. Trump has unleashed another round of attacks
in recent days on federal law enforcement. No, on treasonous federal law enforcement. Thank you.
Saying an interview with the Hill newspaper that he hopes his assaults on the FBI.
Oh, they use that assaults on the FBI. No, the FBI is assaulting him. The FBI is assaulting
this country. The FBI has been assaulting this country. They lied about the golf of talking.
They lied about Hitler. They lied about the JFK assassination. They'll lie about anything.
They're the treasonous ones. They're the ones assaulting this country.
And you know what? If President Trump actually drains the swamp, which is not going to happen
from tweeting, then it will be his greatest accomplishment ever. If he puts Hillary in
jail, if he exposes Obama for his high crimes, that will be the greatest achievement,
not just for President Trump, but for this nation's history. It will be. And it's the
only chance we have a survival. The only chance we have of survival.
Here's a quote from Trump. If I did one mistake with Comey, I should have fired him long.
I should have fired him before I got there. I should have fired him the day I won the primaries.
I should have fired him right after the convention. Say I don't want that guy or at least fired him
the first day of the job. Mr. Trump, President Trump, you're going to say the exact same thing
about Robert Mueller in two years if you don't fire him now and anyone else under him.
Days after ascending to the role of nation's number two law enforcement officer,
Mr. Rosenstein was thrust into a crisis. No, they created the crisis. On a brisk May day,
Mr. Rosenstein and his boss, Mr. Sessions, missing in action, joined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office,
where the president informed them of his plan to oust Mr. Comey to the surprise of White House
Aids who were trying to talk the president out of it. Oh, why is that? Mr. Rosenstein embraced
the idea, even offering to write the memo about the Clinton email inquiry he turned it in shortly
after. A day later, Mr. Trump announced the firing and White House White House Aids released Mr.
Rosenstein's memo, labeling it the basis for Mr. Comey's dismissal. Democrats sharply criticized
Mr. Rosenstein, accusing him of helping to create a cover story for the president to rationalize
the termination. Okay, so he writes a real memo about how Comey totally botched and even had a
rigged investigation at Hillary and they say, how dare you let the president know we let Hillary
off scot-free? How dare you let the president know we let Hillary Clinton break the law?
How dare you let the president know that Hillary Clinton had Chinese operatives inside her email,
her illegal email server, and then they killed 20 assets in China and tortured them?
Yeah, how dare you let the president know that Hillary should be allowed to do that?
Senator Christopher Murphy writes that scum. You wrote a memo that you knew would be used to
perpetuate a lie. You own this debacle. What lie? Oh, you mean Hillary Clinton didn't break the law?
I mean, see, this is what I'm telling you, folks. These Democrats, I don't know what it, are they
all raping kids? I mean, seriously, are all of these Democrats raping children? Why are they such
liars? What do they have to hide? Why do they hate this country? Why do they hate the truth?
No, I'm serious. I don't get it. I don't get it. Why are they so committed to the just total
lies? Why are they so committed to killing this country? Why do they sit here and ignore any and
everything accused or alleged against the Democrat? But if a mouse crawls out from a rat,
if a rat crawls out of a dumpster and goes, oh, did you hear that rat? That rat said Trump raped
it 30 years ago. Get that rat on stand. Get that rat needs to testify against Trump. That rat,
get that rat. That rat can bring Trump down. He's got real allegations to get Trump.
What the hell is wrong with these people, man? When will Trump act? Bring these people down.
They have freaking spirit cookings, man. X2. We were selling it for about three years,
and then they found out how big it was. And I was, we were buying, and they said, oh, we want
more money, more money, and oh, this and that. And so I've broken my contract. And right now,
we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2 that literally is so pure that
if you put it in a peaker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate, it gasses like I dream of genie and it's
purple gas. I mean, that is so pure. It just goes right into your body when you take it.
We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
ordered it six months ago. So I get the price down. I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
I'm breaking the contract. Well, I broke the contract last week. And so this is potentially
the last run. In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2. And we've,
we've got a good supply of it. It'll be gone a couple of months. X2, if you haven't experienced it
in foreshore.com, if you have experienced it, and how great it is, I suggest you stop up on it.
It's available right now for a limited time in foreshore.com. It's 25% off right now.
Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater. And we need to be
concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain
could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests
for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our
Alexa pure gravity filter. And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the
pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the
pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.

Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now,
your host, Owen Shroyer. Alright, I'm gonna finish up with the New York Times story and then
Breaking Judicial Watch story and then Roger Stone is gonna bring in his expertise here
to break this down. Going back to New York Times though, the President's reliance on his memo caught
Mr. Rosenstein by surprise and he became angry at Mr. Trump, according to people who spoke to
Mr. Rosenstein at the time. Well, how does that make any sense? If you write a memo suggesting
something to the President and then he follows through on it, why would that catch you by surprise?
Why would that make you angry? I don't know. I guess you'll have to ask Rosenstein.
Goes on. Mr. Rosenstein then raised the idea of wearing a recording device or wire,
as he put it, to secretly take the President when he visited the White House.
One participant asked whether Mr. Rosenstein was serious and he replied
adamantly that he was. Now, can you imagine if someone had a secret wire taping Obama?
We've already heard some of the stuff from Secret Service, what Obama was engaged in,
but I mean, my goodness. If not him, then Mr. McCabe or other FBI officials interviewing
with Mr. Trump for the job could perhaps wear a wire or otherwise record the President Mr.
Rosenstein offered. So here he is actively engaging in a coup against the President,
against America. White House officials never checked his phone when he arrived for meetings there,
Mr. Rosenstein added, implying it would be easily to secretly record Mr. Trump.
Well, I got news for you. Mr. Trump, as you put it, is not as dumb as you might think,
and he records everything already. I digress. Mr. Rosenstein's suggestion about the 25th Amendment
was similarly a sensitive topic. The amendment allows for the Vice President and majority of
Cabinet officials to declare the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of
his office. So just imagine here's President Trump making progress with North Korea, saving
the economy to degrees we can't even imagine, having huge rallies. He's doing two a week now
when tens of thousands of people show up cheering him. He speaks for hours on end without a teleprompter,
fully coherent, and they think that they can say he should be removed for the 25th Amendment
because he's unable to discharge his powers. I mean, folks, you know, this is just unbelievable
that they think they can get away with that. But this is what the Democrats do. They think
they can bring up some high school slut to stop Brett Kavanaugh from getting on the Supreme Court.
Yeah, I said it. Christine Blazy Ford is a high school slut, floozy. Go ahead and put that on
media matters. I don't care. Someone has to say it. Oh, but Judicial Watch comes out with a story
headline. New FBI records reveal stroke-authored initial draft of Comey letter to Congress about
Clinton emails on Weiner laptop. And so the picture comes even more clearer. Folks, this is such a
rigged job. It's not even funny. So I bring Roger Stone in now. Roger, something came clear to me
today. You started telling, you started reporting right here at Infowars and trying to get the
message to President Trump that they were going to use the 25th Amendment against him.
Right after you did that, whether it was John Kelly or other powers that be,
stopped Infowars from getting to the President's desk. They put a cease and desist on all Infowars
material getting to the President's desk. Do you think President Trump is going to recognize
what the hell's going on here? We told them they were coming for the 25th Amendment. Now the New
York Times tells them after the FISA warrant is about to be declassified as a soft launch to let
the President know, yes, there was a coup against you. Yes, it was the 25th Amendment, but they were
doing it for the right reasons. I mean, Roger, just what do you make of this? Well, first of all,
you're absolutely right, Owen. Infowars was the first major media organization in the country
to report on the fact that there would be a 25th Amendment coup to try to take down the President
that if the Russian collusion frame job failed, which it clearly has, that the next line of defense
for the deeply entrenched two-party duopoly would be a 25th Amendment coup. Now we have the deputy
Attorney General, the in fact, the de facto Attorney General of the United States caught red-handed
plotting against his boss, the President of the United States. The reason that they want to take
the President down is abundantly clear in the controversy over the President's order to declassify
all of the information pertaining to the illegal and unconstitutional use of FISA warrants by the
Obama administration. Now, defying the President's orders, the intelligence agencies insist on
continuing to redact part of that information, claiming falsely that it would somehow endanger
the national security or would expose their methods abroad or here in terms of surveillance.
These are fake excuses. They're covering up the political use and abuse of power to surveil
the Republican candidate for President. If President Trump does not now fire Mr. Rosenstein,
when will he do so? Their desire to remove him is directly related to the fact that he is about
to expose them in the largest political scandal in American history. Roger, I mean, I don't even
know how to explain my mood. I mean, people can see it from tuning in today, but we're in a state of
emergency. And I just don't know if President Trump fully understands it. Obviously, he's smart.
Obviously, he gets it. He talks about it. But I mean, what is he waiting for? That, you know,
that to me is the bit. What are you waiting for, President Trump? They're coming for you. They're
coming for this country. They have to be stopped. He doesn't just... Roger, he needs to fire everyone.
Everyone needs to be fired. I'm serious, man. Well, Owen, actually, I think today's a very
good day because the Rosenstein story is not in some obscure conservative website,
but it's broken by The New York Times. That means that there's zero chance that the president doesn't
see it. You see, around the president, there's a huge game of keep away that goes on constantly,
while Kelly and his other hindlers try to stop him from seeing what's really going on. Meanwhile,
they keep giving him terrible advice. For example, a story in the Hill today that says,
a number of our foreign allies are concerned about this order to redact because it may affect them.
This is nonsense. The president is surrounded by either timid advisors or advisors who are putting
their interests in the interest of the deep state that they serve ahead of the president's interest.
For example, arguing, oh, don't fire Mr. Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein before the election. That'll
hurt you in the election. Fire them after the election. Then, if the elections don't go well,
they'll say, oh, you can't fire them now. You don't have the political support in the country to do
so. The president really does need to fire everybody and start over again with a few
exceptions. Larry Kudlow is doing an incredible job implementing the president's plan to revitalize
the American economy. There are a few patriots in the White House, but not many.
Well, and look, I don't think John Kelly is the enemy of this country by any stretch.
I don't think John Kelly is bad, but if John Kelly is playing any sort of role as a filter or
keep away, he's got to go. I'm sorry. He's got to go, too, because nobody else is going to tell the
president what's actually going on. Nobody else is going to raise the red flag, raise the alarm,
like infowars. And if John Kelly is keeping us off the president's desk, then President Trump's
never going to understand how serious this is. Let's be clear. General John Kelly,
just like General Mattis, have a first loyalty to the military industrial complex to the deep
state. We know, for example, that Mattis voted for Hillary Clinton and spoke for her during the
election. The president keeps referring to him as Mad Dog, a nickname that, from what I understand,
he despises and he denigrates the president behind his back. Kelly thinks his job is to
save the world from Donald Trump, not understanding the president's eccentric operating and management
style, which, by the way, works. Look at the American economy. Now he threatens the deep state
as never before because their entire Russian delusion, collusion, fraud will collapse. It was
only built as a diversion from the real crimes of the Obama administration pertaining to the
misuse of FISA warrants. This fight is getting riper by the day, but unfortunately it's the drip,
drip, drip of information that comes out while the mainstream media continues to harp on
non-existent Russian collusion. We learned only recently that Bruce Orr had briefed
Adam Weissman, the number two man in the Mueller investigation on both the fabrication of the
dossier and that Andrew Weissman had been the deputy attorney general who signed off on the
extension of that illegal warrant. So the deep state is in deep trouble and that's why they are
talking about a 25th Amendment takedown. This is the fight for the republic. We are in the fight
for America right now. Do not be twisted, folks. Do not be confused. This is the fight for America.
President Trump is the last president to save America. Either we win now or America dies at
the hands of the Democrats. We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage and that's why we need
you to go to the site now. If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals,
please consider a contribution. Twenty-five, fifty-a-hundred, two-fifty or even five hundred
dollars would be of God's end to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to
destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.
on the globalist at point-blank range and with your help spreading it and with your help downloading
it, we are unstoppable. I want to plow into all of this. Then I'm going to spend a few minutes

started by talking about John Kerry. John Kerry, we hadn't used this past week, undermining the
United States once again. He's been illegally advising and negotiating with the Iranian regime
how to deal with and overcome Donald Trump's sanctions, trying to salvage the badly flawed
Iranian nuclear deal. Now remember, Obama's notorious 2015 nuclear deal transferred billions
of dollars on pallets and cash to the world's leading exporter of terrorism and it gave them
a pathway to acquire nuclear weapons at the end of 10 years. That would be 2025. Now Obama and
Kerry did not take the deal to Congress because it had no support. It was just a personal deal
between Obama and the Iranians and Trump canceled the deal, of course, and slammed Iran with new
sanctions. So John Kerry goes to Paris to meet with the Iranians and undermine U.S. policy.
Let's play this short video reminding us because we've seen this movie once before.
I want to see John Kerry before Congress in 1971. Let's remind ourselves what he was up to.
Okay, we'll bring that up next segment. I'm going to bring on Frank Hawkins has written
an article. He is the former U.S. Army Intelligence Officer, Associated Press,
Foreign Correspondent, and his new article, American Thinker, is John Kerry, a Trader
for the Ages. And Frank, are you there? Welcome back to the show.
Yes, thanks very much. It's good to be back, Joel.
Okay, so first of all, we got just two minutes before the break. Then we'll take it up again
with a video. What did John Kerry do in the Vietnam era? How much time did he serve in
Vietnam? And what did he do as soon as he came back? A couple things. Starting off,
Kerry served the normal kind of duty for someone serving in Vietnam was one year.
Kerry served a total of four months. And the reason he got out early was because he had
received a number of medals, including three purple hearts, the purple heart, of course,
being the medal that you awarded if you were wounded while under fire in a combat situation.
He had a silver star, and I think, yeah, he also had a bronze medal. So it's been,
it was well established some time ago by John O'Neill, who wrote a book together with Jerome
Corsi, who of course is very familiar to this audience. And basically, he ended up faking
those medals. He was able to gain the system, and it was a very, it was a totally despicable
bit of business. Okay, well, want to remind everyone, we are taking calls all this hour.
The phone number is 1-877-789-2539. That's 877-789-2539-789 Alex. You can call and talk to myself
and our guests. So we're going to come back after the break, continue with Frank Hawkins
about John Kerry, who apparently we know now faked his injuries to serve only four months,
apparently only enough time to get some film footage to come back and testify before Congress
and begin his political career. We'll be right back in a couple of minutes with Frank Hawkins,
former AP foreign correspondent on John Kerry, The Trader. Right back with you.
I knew we had no future. We didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success.
But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why
we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, if you spread the word
about our articles and videos, m4s.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal
scumbags. We'll win. We have huge sales, m4s.com right now. We're still able to operate the
shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact of trying to block our commerce,
and you're right to the market. But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
sorrow's the blood we'll spend when this is m4s.com. We're your support. I'm counting on you.
He aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex
Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Joel Gilbert coming to you from the People's
Republic of California. We're continuing to take calls 877-789-Alex. And we're talking about John
Kerry, part of the resistance. Ever since he came back from Vietnam, he's been advising the Iranians
how to deal with Donald Trump and overcome the U.S. sanctions. Frank Hawkins wrote an article for
the American thinker called John Kerry, A Trader for the Ages. Let's play a quick clip of John Kerry
in Congress when he came back from Vietnam. We rationalize destroying villages in order to save
them. We saw America lose her sense of morality as she accepted very coolly a me lie and refused to
give up the image of American soldiers that hand out chocolate bars and chewing gum. We learned
the meaning of free fire zones, shoot anything that moves. And we watched while America placed a
cheapness on the lives of orientals. Okay, Frank. So tell us about what John Kerry was up to in
Congress slandering the United States, slandering the U.S. military, and what was he trying to
accomplish? And then what did he do and talk about his meetings with the Viet Cong in Paris at that
time? Well, let me just point out, and it's very important to understand this piece of it. At the
time that he testified in this Senate committee, and at the time that he went to Paris and met with
both the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese, he at that time was in fact still a reserve navy
officer. So that's an important piece of background to understand what was going on when he went to
Paris. And at that same time, by the way, Henry Kissinger was involved in negotiating an end
to war with the communists. So and later, at one point, Kerry admitted, he said,
I've been to Paris. I've talked with both delegations of the peace talks. As I say,
the Democrat Republic of Vietnam and the provisional revolutionary government.
And so he admitted what he'd done. That was most astonishing of all. I mean,
the clear violation of the Logan Act. And a lot of people don't know, Joe,
that during that time, he also published his own book. And by the way, I still,
I have a copy of that book, and it is despicable what he did there. And one of the things he
wrote in that book was he said, we were probably angriest about all that we were told about Vietnam
and the mystical war to get that mystical war against communism. He went on to say that a new
soldier, and by the way, that was the name of his book, The New Soldier, he said a new soldier
has returned to America to a nation torn apart by the killing we were asked to do.
He said, we will not quickly join those who march on Veterans Day.
We will not readily join the American Legion or the veterans of foreign wars. We will not
take solace from the creation of monuments. And, you know, since I have written this article and
one of the other articles that I wrote for the American thinker that referenced Kerry as one of
the most, as the most destructive America in my lifetime. It's amazing how many Vietnam vets
have been in touch with me via email or by phone or whatever. And almost every one of them
were aware of what traitor's behavior that Kerry undertook and what he'd done. And I tell
you what, Joel, the anger is still out there among those vets, and it's very deep.
Okay, let's put up that tweet from President Trump where he talks about
John Kerry needing to be investigated for violations of the Constitution and the Logan Act,
where he's talking about this is a violation of U.S. law. You cannot go and negotiate with foreign
adversaries. That's only the role of U.S. government. Let's go real quick to, we got
Chris in Alabama. Chris, go ahead. You're on the Alex Jones show with myself and Frank Hawkins.
Hi, I'm Chris in Alabama. John Kerry should be, he should be indicted and although I have a lot
of friends in the military and stuff, he should be brought in and indicted and prosecuted because
the way I feel, he should be put in front of the fire squad and shot because what he's doing is wrong.
Okay, Frank, look, give us some other highlights of John Kerry between betraying the United States
with the Vietnamese to betraying the United States with the Iranians all in Paris. What
are some of the other highlights or lowlights of his career? I think he also went to Nicaragua
and cozyed up to the Sandinistas. That was one thing. And I think later on, of course, his daughter,
we know, married an Iranian tied to the Iranian regime. What else can you tell us on the in-between
years of these bookends? In between is, I mean, all the things that you have just pointed out,
of course, we're very much correct. You know, after he came into the Senate,
he, one of the first things he did in 1985, that he traveled to Nicaragua and he cozyed up to
Ben President Daniel Ortega, a far left-wing Sandinista who had at that time very strong ties
to Cuba and the Soviet Union, of course, and they had been accused on their own right of human
rights abuses, but these were the guys he was cozying up to. And then again, in 2005, he surfaced
with his old same old theme that he's always had, and that is slandering American troops.
That's one of his favorite things to do, it would seem. And in 2005, he claimed that the U.S.
forces were terrorizing the Iraqi people. And in fact, he told Bob Schaffer on Face to Nation,
he said, look, he said, there's no reason, Bob, that young American soldiers need to be going
into the homes of Iraqis and the dead at night, terrorizing kids and children. You know, women.
I mean, this is just outrageous slander against our good military. And it just, in my opinion,
of course, it's just, I think it's unforgivable. In fact, in 2006, he had a Democratic campaign
rally in California. He told a group of college students, you know, education, if you make the
most of it, you study hard, you do your homework, and you make an effort to be smart, you can do
a role. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq. I mean, where that- What about- What about a
Secretary of State? He was Obama administration, one of the most hostile to the state of Israel,
U.S. ally, only democracy in the region that has supported American defense initiatives for many
years. What was his role in the Obama administration vis-a-vis Israel and their conflict with Hamas
as well as Hizballah? Yeah, well, of course, see, he has- He- The Jerusalem Post recently had a
piece in which he was- They accused Kerry of having an accurate and obsessive place in his heart for
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Israel itself. And Kerry is one of those
guys who said he's actually blamed Israel, you know, for the rise of the Islamic State.
And he even went on to say the Islamic State's ideology has nothing to do with Islam. Of course,
we all know it has everything to do with Islam. And the Jerusalem Post also reported that Kerry,
earlier this year, met in London with a very close associate of the Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas. And the name of this guy is Hussein Aga. And he met for him with a long
conversation. And Kerry told him, told Aga, to tell Abbas, that Trump will not remain in office
for a long time. It was reported that Kerry said that within a year, there's a good chance that
Trump would not be in the White House. And what could be more treasonous than that?
Right. Well, the radical left has always been very hostile toward Israel, Israel being a
national state with strong borders, strong defense and Western values. This has always
been something that the left has been hostile and unhappy about. So it's no surprise that
being anti-Israel was part of Kerry's makeup, as well as being anti-American all these years,
someone who almost became president, don't forget. I'm going to come back in three minutes.
Keep your calls coming in. It's 1-800, I'm sorry, 1-877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539. We'll be right

Gilbert coming to you from the People's Republic of California. We're gonna talk about now one of
my favorite U.S. senators, Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz is considered to be in some trouble in Texas.
There is a lot of enthusiasm for one Beto O'Rourke, a Irish descended guy with a Hispanic name.
And Trump has agreed to go to Texas to do a big rally in October to bail him out, hopefully.
Let's take a look at a video of talking about a recent poll. What's going on in Texas with Cruz
and Beto O'Rourke. Let's take a look. Well, the Senate race in Texas is gaining national attention
ahead of November's midterms and one poll is giving an edge to the Democrats. A recent Ifsauce
Reuters poll gives Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke a two-point advantage over Republican
Senator Ted Cruz. President Trump has said he plans to hold a major rally for Cruz in Texas
in October. Alana Rocha is a multimedia reporter for the Texas Tribune. She joins us now from
Austin, Texas. Good to see you. Thank you. Good morning. So Alana, Texas is a reliably red state,
although it's sort of been inching towards Republican reporters some polls. You get the idea
that the news is covering a lot of polls that show an even or Cruz even behind in a red state.
So, look, Cruz's opponent is a lightweight. This guy worked as an Internet provider for
10 years like customer service. He ran for El Paso City Council. I think he was in a band.
Nothing wrong with that. But then he ran for Congress as a Democratic course. He never did
anything in his whole life. He's a lightweight. Of course, Ted Cruz, a lot of experience,
you know, Solicitor General of Texas, argued before the Supreme Court, deep knowledge of the
Constitution and the law. The problem with Ted, if you say what's wrong with Ted Cruz,
Ted's problem is he's not living up to his standard of excitement that he brought in the past.
He was exciting when he was a man on a mission. When he comes in with this kind of a boring
approach, he says things like, when there's extreme hatred on the left, don't respond in kind,
have fun, be a warrior. So, Ted used to be the guy that would be bold and get in your face and
stand up to Obama. First guy to stand up to Obama, shut down the government over Obamacare.
100% support for Ted Cruz. People remember even this one. He read Cicero on the Senate floor.
Let's remind ourselves how much and why people love Ted Cruz with the Cicero video.
The words of Cicero, powerfully relevant, 2,077 years later.
When, President Obama, do you mean to cease abusing our patience?
How long is that madness of yours still to mock us? When is there to be an end to that unbridled
audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now? Do not the nightly guards placed on the border?
Do not the watches posted throughout the city? Do not, does not the alarm of the people
and the union of all good men and women? Does not the precaution taken of assemblies?
Okay, let me break in here. This is the kind of thing that Ted did back in 2010, 11, 12,
you know, I'm sorry, 2012, 13, 14. He was the bold leader and people loved him.
In this campaign, Cruz is not giving anyone any particular reason to go out and vote for Cruz,
other than the fear of the negative. He tried that in the presidential campaign. He would say,
if you vote for Donald Trump, it's a vote for Hillary. So now he's saying, well, vote for me,
so I can continue the Trump agenda. It's not really a mission. And Ted has to have a mission.
And the reason for that is he's not a very personable person. He doesn't have the
personability of most politicians. People misunderstand him in that way. He's not a
natural politician. It's very hard for him. People mistakenly think this might be because Cruz is
aloof or he's arrogant, but that's not true. Ted is just extremely shy. He's a very shy person.
He doesn't warm up to people easily. Now, he's in politics for the principles upholding the
Constitution. All the right reasons. He's not there to schmooze and he's not there to make friends.
So Ted doesn't really have the personality or even the looks to get people to want to run out
and vote for him. He has to have a mission. And he's repeating the same mistake of his
presidential campaign where he didn't have a mission. He just said, well, I'm Ted Cruz,
you know, go out and vote for me. Even though he was the outsider candidate, he was the guy that
was going to drain the swamp. But when the election campaign started, he hired a very
establishment campaign team. He had an establishment campaign strategy. Have a chairman in every
state, a chairman in every county go through the motions of fundraising. But he was fundraising
with no mission, with no message. And he's got the exact same team now in Texas. He's doing the
exact same mistakes where he's just running around, raising money and giving a standard
stump speech with no mission. Ted Cruz has to have a mission, a special agenda to get people
motivated because he's not a natural politician that you're going to run and vote for. That's
what happened in the presidential campaign. Donald Trump came along and said, okay, Ted,
if you don't want to be Ted Cruz, you don't want to be that outsider guy that you've been talking
about, I'll be Ted Cruz. And that's how Trump won as the Ted Cruz candidate, the drain, the swamp
guy. Let's look at my clip from Art of the Insult and you'll see how the clash went down between
Trump and Ted Cruz, a clip from Art of the Insult.
So the media would love to see Donald and me getting the giant food fight. I'm certainly not
going to engage in that. I hope Donald won't either. Trump retweeted this image, Cruz's wife
in an unflattering pose next to Melania Trump. When I saw somebody tweeted a picture of Melania
and a picture of Heidi. With the caption, no need to spill the beans, the images are worth a thousand
words. An enraged Ted Cruz looking right into our camera to deliver this message to Donald Trump.
Donald, you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone. I have to tell you,
I think Heidi Cruz is a great person. I think it's the best thing he's got going at his kids,
if you want to know the truth. Leave Heidi the hell alone. So will you support him as the nominee?
I'm going to beat him. He was asked today about a National Enquirer story claiming he has had
five mistresses. This National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies.
And it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen. It is a story that quoted one
source on the record, Roger Stone, Donald Trump's chief political advisor. Let me break in here.
So you get the idea. When it came to a clash between Trump and Ted Cruz, Trump clearly won.
Ted became unnerved. In principle, he didn't want to fight back. He said, I don't want to go that.
I don't want to have a food fight. And, you know, Trump attacked him on all kind of areas and Ted
just kind of melted down as Trump made the point. Anyway, Ted needs to rally. He needs to come up
with a mission. He needs to explain why he can be the leader of this mission to preserve the
Constitution, the defender of liberty again. Without that, I don't think the Texans are going
to be so motivated to give Ted another six years in office. We're going to see Donald Trump go down
and to Texas to a big rally. And hopefully we'll see if Ted, one of my favorite senators,
he's the real deal. He believes in the Constitution. He believes in America.
And but he's not a marketing guy. And he needs to follow his instincts. Trump followed his instincts
and Ted did not. We'll be right back. We're going to talk about the socialism deniers
in the next segment, 877-789 Alex. I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.

X2, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and how much

Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. Joel Gilbert guest hosting from the People's Republic of
California right from the left coast. We'll be taking calls next couple segments 877-789-2539-877-789
Alex. Now we've all heard of climate deniers and the Democrats like to call everybody deniers that
doesn't believe in their view of the world. I have come up with a new term, I call it socialism
deniers. The Democrat Party is now an open radical socialist party and Trump is letting them know,
we saw even in the rally last night in Las Vegas, that they're looking to bring socialism,
Venezuela style and worse, to America. Let's look at a clip of Trump at the UN talking about socialism
in Venezuela. The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented,
but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves,
yet shortages of basic necessities like toilet paper and medicine abound. Citizens queue up for
food at bear-shelled grocery stores, others pick through trash. Okay look, socialism means the
things that Bernie Sanders campaigned on, breaking up American business, putting the government in
control, breaking up the banking and pharmaceutical industries, agriculture. It's all about
nationalization. The government takes over everything, the Department of Pharmacy, the
Department of High Tech, and government officials are very inefficient, they're not very skilled.
So you put state bureaucrats in charge of all these great businesses and the entire country
becomes one big failing socialist enterprise. But people still go to Bernie Sanders rallies
and they clap even though they have no idea what he's talking about. Let's look at a quick clip
of Bernie and his socialism from the 2016 campaign.
If Wall Street does not end its greed, we will end it for them. Not only will big banks not be
too big to fail, but big time bankers will not be too big to jail.
Right, this is communism. They put the bourgeois or the entrepreneurs in jail because they're
evil and the government takes over all the industries. And then all the industries fail
and everyone stars. I visited Russia when I was a student, 1984, the height of the Cold War. Andropov
was a prime minister of Russia. And I visited many of the refuseniks, the people who were
applying to leave Russia. And I'll tell you a conversation I had that explains everything
you'll ever need to understand about socialism. I asked one of these guys, I asked him where he
worked. He said, well, I work in a factory. I said, what do they make? He said, nothing.
I said, well, how's that possible? He said, in communism, you don't work eight hours a day,
you just have to be at work eight hours a day. And I said, why don't they fire you? He said,
well, the manager is drunk and he doesn't work either. And I said, but don't you need to earn
money? He said, why should I bother earning money? Have you ever been to any stores in Moscow? I said,
yes, I have. And they're empty. He said, that's right, there's nothing to buy. So why should I work?
So that's the story of socialism. It's depression, alcoholism, starvation. That's what they did in
Venezuela. They nationalized everything, oil, agriculture, finance, telecommunications, food.
Everything's going out of business. The history of socialism progressivism in the 20th century
is that they murdered 150 million of their own citizens in peacetime to try to force them into
this idea of this utopian world where the government controls everything and everyone is is so happy.
I'll play a clip from my other film in the infowars store. There's no place like utopia
talking about the communist ideology and what really goes down. Let's play that clip.
In Cambodia, the communists killed everyone who had glasses. Because if you had glasses,
you could read. You were educated. You have to do something with the people who have the
bad knowledge in their head. So we're going to start with a clean slate and just create new human beings.
It's a very evil idea. In the south, there are still generations of people
and they just have to die. They just have to die. The most evil atrocities of our time
have been committed by utopians in power. They think that they are the divinity.
That's why they're so dangerous. That's why they kill so many people.
All right. So look, today's Democrat Party has adopted this agenda. They're denying,
they're in denial that it's a hundred years of complete failure. So I call these Democrats today,
the socialism deniers. Let's take a look at the socialism deniers, Bernie Sanders.
He's a big socialism denier, but he's managed to get the rest of the Democrat Party to go along
with his socialism. Let's put up the photo of Bernie Sanders, the denier. Next one,
of course, Hillary Clinton. Socialism denier. Let's put up all those photos of the deniers.
Barack Obama. Socialism denier. There's Hillary. There's Obama. Cory Booker. I'm just going to
read them off. Socialism denier. Kamala Harris, right here from California. She's on the list.
Socialism denier. Progressive socialists, they're all in denial. They won't tell you the truth about
socialism. They deny the reality. Now they've got the new ones. Of course, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
She's in there. There's a socialism denier. We've got Andrew Gillum in Florida. Socialism denier.
And this is a technique that the left has been using since the 1930s. People have seen my film,
Dreams of My Real Father, and Obama's real father, real dad, the man who raised him, of course,
Frank Marshall Davis, the Russian agent who raised him, was recruited by white communists in
Chicago to try to trick black people into joining the communist movement. Now they wanted no part
of it because blacks were religious people in Chicago. They believed in love thy neighbor.
They weren't interested in class warfare or atheism. So they sent Frank Marshall Davis out to
Hawaii to try to start a strike to take over the island because they wanted to remove U.S.
naval forces from Hawaii. He started a strike that eventually failed. And in my film, I think I made
an argument with a mountain of evidence that that's Obama's real dad, and that Obama then
followed in his father's footsteps back to Chicago where white communists, Bill Ayers, former
Weather Underground terrorist, had his father bring Obama to Chicago where he became a community
agitator. They used the word organizer as a nice way of saying it. And Obama's job was to
infiltrate the black church groups because they thought if they had a front man who was black,
they could convince minorities to join the socialist movement even though it was completely
against their own interests. Even the black community in Chicago were no fools. They rejected
Obama. He was thought of as a phony, as a radical supported by communists. It was only when he put
his presidential campaign together that he was able to present this story of my father's a goat
herder from Kenya. I'm going to bring us all together and so on and so on. But it was a stealth
socialism. It was a socialism where he pretended to be middle of the road. I'm going to cut the
deficit in half. I'm going to support the Constitution. We're going to enforce our
border laws. And as soon as he got into office, of course, he threw the voters under the bus
and pursued this radical agenda that nobody voted for. Eight years later, the Democrat party is an
open socialist party, but they are denying the reality of socialism. That's why I call all of
these, let's put their pictures up again, the socialism deniers. It's going to be Hillary
Clinton denier, Barack Obama, of course, denier, Cory Booker, socialism denier, Kamala Harris,
socialism denier. These are the deniers of the reality. And now they've recruited these minorities
like Acasio Cortez Gillum. These people are trying to manipulate people of the same race or identity
into voting for this cause. And they're all put there by white socialists and communists.
We'll be right back taking phone calls for the rest of the hour. Come on back after the break.
Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
in Leilani Estates. But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater. And we need to be concerned
about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles. And acid rain could lower
the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals,
alkalinity, and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to
optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.

about john carrey the trader for the ages negotiating with the iranians behind the back
of the trump administration we've talked about ted cruz and the problems he's having in texas with
beto or rock because ted has not defined a mission as to why he should go to the senate again
hopefully trump will will bail him out and i've talked about the socialism deniers how the democrat
party today is full-blown radical socialist and they're denying the reality of the misery of socialism
all those illegal immigrants come from mostly socialist countries that are trying to get away
from socialism and the democrats are are wanting him more of the same as the world's the rest of us
we're going to take calls the rest of the hour let's go to craig in louisiana go ahead you're on
the alex jones show oh yes hi um i wanted to say uh first off it's an absolute um honor to uh to
talk to you joel uh i'm nice from time i listened to the program thank you sir thank you okay what's
on your mind lay it on yeah i have a i have a very very quick and easy uh it's a uh i call it my five
point plan for success for us to win this november one infrastructure it's so sorely needed um it has
to be big it has to be bold bye thank you um and you know and we got to get it going i believe
if the president pushed for it the congress forced it through the senate i believe uh
you got that plus cavanaugh okay i'm going to give you only one because we're limited on time
it's a great idea thanks for the call that uh you know trump pushed for the agenda to to rebuild
america why spend trillions in the middle east uh for achieving nothing why can't we give a trillion
to uh detroit or chicago or rebuild our roads i think he's made some progress on it and it's
it's definitely part of a winning formula uh thank you let's go to uh want to go to ethan
ethan in kansas go ahead you're on the alex jones show yeah so i have to talk to you jill uh a
couple things on my mind first thing is uh people need to stop feeling like we need to wait for
someone to take action to make the change if we want to see you know and the time is now
and it really does it feels good to be involved it's empowering to be active and you'll we've been
out recently doing some protests over the interstate bridges and holding up signs talking to people
doing interviews you know and and that's what it's really all about because i've been a long time
listener and not only for the information but you guys uh correctly identify the spiritual
motivation of of people that are trying to destroy this country and rule the most intimate
aspects of our lives as being you know leaning towards uh satanism as far as the uh upper echelon
of the control grid goes and we know that we're right you know we know that we have got on our
side that that we are standing for truth and justice in reality so so quick relying on other
people to go out there and do it for you we need to get involved we need to okay all right well
thanks thanks for the call look it's a good point these are interesting times and you hear obama
running around michelle obama filling stadiums you got to be involved you got to vote well that's
certainly true for everybody especially conservatives uh if we come out and vote uh we have the
ability to do things ourselves if you don't go out and vote uh the radical left is busy registering
everybody including uh illegals who can vote by mail and there's no way to track them voter fraud
is going to be huge in this election as it is every election people have no idea how bad it is but
that's that's for another show uh again one eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
one eight seven seven seven eight nine alex i'm going to go to uh benny in texas uh benny you're
on the alex jones show uh first of all tell me from what you know what's the mood uh and the
feeling about the senate race in texas between ororkan cruise
oh hey how you doing joe uh mr joe gilbert it's good to be on with you i listened to you uh
every time you get on with the alex jones and everything i'd like your video from uh uh the
art of the insult donald trump and uh but yeah um other than that um thanks uh well you you live
in texas what are you hearing and what are you feeling about the mood do people want to send
ted cruise back to washington or does has he lost the uh the edge what do you think well see yeah well
see i live in el paso texas actually and uh you know what um i'm a truck driver and i don't get much
of the of the you know local news but when i do it's not looking too it's not looking too too good
for for ted cruise because i mean well you know it's el paso for you but uh uh i mean uh okay well
all right and then what do you want trump to do uh in terms of the deep state what's happening right
now yeah see uh you know i'm hoping trump can do something about uh you know going um you know like
uh you know indicting indicting the people that he has to indict you know i don't know what's taking
him so long i mean i do hear you know alex jones and owens shroyer and everybody else rob do and
everybody else you know talk about that you know it has you know it takes time you know he needs to
get the people in place you know to get a good thorough investigation going but i mean sometimes
i mean you gotta you gotta think and wonder if this is happening like you know like uh biblical
proportions to like where it you know sometimes you you know you want to think that donald trump
may be the the the biggest uh you know like uh uh how do you call it like uh you know the
antichrist the biggest deception but you know i'm i'm still believing that he is not you know that
he is thanks for the call look uh it's definitely a somewhat of a frustration and a mystery uh
donald trump built a career on your fired uh and he just doesn't seem to want to pull the trigger
on all these clearly conflicted uh bad actors the bias the deception uh bruce or i went to
high school with bruce or i've known bruce or since i was six years old and uh he should have
been fired a long time ago now i can tell you about bruce or that he actually is a very honest
person and i think everything bruce or did was probably at the direction of his wife nellie or
or who was a red diaper baby her mother was a uh communist supporter uh she went to russia studied
russian became heavily involved with uh the whole russian collectivization writing about it so i
think bruce uh got in way over his head but he should have been fired along with everybody else
and trump seems to be holding back that's the one thing that the conservatives are just super
frustrated why can't this guy pull the trigger already uh let's go ahead to uh dr kelly in
california dr kelly from the people's republic welcome to the alex joneshow hey i'm used to
having about 40 seconds so i'll make it quick um i'm thanking you for pointing out the issues with
john carrey and i started faxing congress a couple years ago about violations of the logan act and
that's 18 united states code annotated section 953 for those interested and the uh the socialism
deniers jerry brown and uh camilla harris uh are also bar attorneys and that's the one thing that
i'm grateful for is that donald trump is not a bar attorney and i think ted cruise needs to read the
art of the deal and uh get it straightened out and um thank you for your work all right dr kelly
thanks for all your comments look we've been through it on this show uh ted cruise is just
going through the motions fundraising giving a standard speech he doesn't have the personality
or the looks to be someone that you just say wow this guy i really want to send him to washington
again he's just kind of hanging on like he did in the presidential race he needs to find a message
and an agenda to justify why he needs to go back to washington hopefully uh trump will straighten
him out when he shows up uh let's go to raffael in the bronx bronx new york raffael you're on the
alex jones show hi how you doing i just want to say first of all thank you because you guys have
made such a big impact i'm porto rican i'm calling from the bronx i just want to let donald trump know
that he has a huge latin support i want him to know that and i feel that he should get more bolder
you know there's so many people out here ready to take the streets as far as you know the same way
that they're doing a peaceful protest we should he should lead us and and know that the support is
definitely there we're waiting for him to just push that button and tell people to go out there
because we're ready he has a huge support and i just want him to know that we we have his back
and we're not okay well i tell me raffael why does he have that big support in the hispanic community
why because because people need to realize that the latin community has always been conservative
they they've been people people have been you know brainwashed to think that we're just supporting
this this uh system of welfare and and that's not true i'm a working i'm a working class
porto rican male from new york and we've i come from a conservative family and when we look down
at it yes we've been we've been forced to vote democratic but you know when you really look
down at it you know we have republican views and and and you need to support i'm a republican now
i'm a republican registered republican in new york state and there's so many okay raffael look
these are great points thanks for the call we're just ending our our hour thank you for the call a
