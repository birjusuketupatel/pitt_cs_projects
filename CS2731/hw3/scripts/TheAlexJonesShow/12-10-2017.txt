Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
so does he live from the Infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones
welcome to the Alex Jones show it is Sunday December the 10th 2017 I'm David Knight I'm your
host today usually you'll find me at 8 a.m. Monday through Friday but today I'm here on the Sunday
show and we have an amazing sequence of events over the last couple of days one of them you
probably haven't heard of but you have heard about the attacks by the Washington Post coming out with
tweets trying to pretend that nobody showed up to hear President Trump at the rally that he had for
Roy Moore then as President Trump says you're absolutely lying showing this empty stadium
here's what really happened then you have the journalists lining up to defend this Washington
Post reporter who put out this fake attack piece and then that followed CNN the previous day
coming after Donald Trump Jr. this is weaponized media folks but yesterday we had an attack against
Owen Shroyer as he was covering a memorial service and for for Kate Steinle here in Austin, Texas
and a lot of anti-pop people showed up to try to shut that down and they shut down Owen and they
didn't just shut him down they committed very serious assault against him and we're gonna
have a clip of that when you talk about the laws understand when you talk about assault and battery
assault is threatening somebody and being able to credibly do that and these people had
masks on they had weapons they had shields and one of them at least was carrying a gun
when you're carrying a gun wearing a mask and brandishing the gun that's the official way
that the legal term for that when you're carrying a gun and using and threatening somebody either
with the gun by the way that you're holding it or threatening them as you're holding a gun that's
called brandishing a weapon that's called assault and so tomorrow Owen Shroyer is going to file a
criminal complaint because the police didn't do anything about that they let them mace other people
they got together in a big group I mean at one respect it looked like a Larpers convention
because that's the way the NFA people are but it was a very serious assault these people were
threatening violence they were shoving him hitting him in the back with a stick as he was trying to
just get to the rally the people who were at the rally for Kate Steinley remember that the illegal
immigrant who had been transported it was either five or six times I think he was either he was
about to be deported for the sixth or seventh time when he said he just found a gun that was laying
on the bench and and the gun just went off just like in the movies he had nothing to do with it
it wasn't premeditated murder it wasn't even manslaughter it was just the gun did it the gun
did it and so still no justice for Kate Steinley and that's what we're seeing over and over again
and no protection of anybody who isn't politically correct there is no protection for people who are
using weapons against the media and certainly no concern about that by our weaponized media
who comes after conservatives who come after President Trump we're also going to give you
some updates on some other stories in the news Roger Stone will be joining us to talk about
what's going on Michael Flynn and also Tom Arnold and other issues that have surfaced many many
things coming out in the last couple of days we have the Pentagon is now saying they're going
to have their first ever audit well maybe it's about time because there's several trillion dollars
missing they even have 44,000 troops missing how in the world do you do that are these
they don't even know where their troops are they're not saying that it's classified that they
can't tell you they're saying their destination is unknown and this is coming out of Stars and
Stripes magazine people in the conservative media have just picked this up this is how big
the US empire has grown America has lost track of the number of wars that we're fighting we've
lost track of our soldiers just all over the place I mean this is the insanity that we're
looking at here is there some way that we can ever get back to a constitutional government
is there some way that we'll audit the Pentagon or maybe even the politicians in Washington DC
maybe I don't think that it's going to happen I think maybe instead of auditing the Fed we may
be able to transcend it with cryptocurrencies it's a given that other countries are going to
transcend the petro dollar that's the only question is what's going to happen with that
so let's be right back I'm David Knight
Mike in Arizona you're on the air worldwide go ahead
oh Alex you can rent any day of the week thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot
and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local

waging war on corruption
it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
welcome back to the alex jones show on david night on this december the 10th 2017
yesterday was a pretty amazing event there was a rally in support of kate steinley to
draw attention to that travesty that happened in san francisco the sanctuary city that is now
given sanctuary to the murder saying he had absolutely nothing to do with her death even
though there was a loaded gun that was stolen out of the seat of a plm officers car somehow that just
went off close to this individual who was about to be deported for either the sixth or the seventh
time kept coming in he'd have been convicted of multiple felonies but he said that the gun just
went off on his own just like in the movies he had absolutely nothing to do with it you know
he just set these things down and they're so dangerous that the liberals think that they
go off without anybody even touching them and so they didn't even convict him of manslaughter they
just convicted him of having possession of a firearm when he wasn't supposed to have it
but when you look at this event yesterday owens chore went to report on this here in austin and
look at these larper idiots who are very violent quite frankly they were very intimidating they
were pushing and shoving him as he was trying to get by they would get one side of the other
i mean at one level if it wasn't for the violence that we know that they're capable of and if it
wasn't for the fact that they are threatening him with one of the individuals not having just
sticks and shields and helmets and masks but also one of the group had at least one of the group
had a rifle that he was brandishing and i'm using that in the legal sense when you have a weapon
and you are displaying it or using it or holding that weapon as you are making threats against
people as they were against owen that is called brandishing a weapon and it also is called assault
when you're making credible threats against somebody whether it is with a stick with
with a nail in the end of it or even if it's just a stick and a group of people he was surrounded
by people there were people in the back of him that you don't see in that video so let's play
some of this video and i'll narrate it for the people who are listening on the radio this is
owens chore yesterday at a memorial in recognition of kate steinle and austin texas and the people
who showed up in force were antifa marxists you can see some of them wearing masks that have
a hammer and sickle on it so here's that video owens chore here for info wars dot com i am in
downtown austin texas i am about to walk into woldridge square here where you have a kate steinle
march happening that has been invaded how are you guys doing info wars i thought you'd say
something like that after all we're trying to honor a dead person here but that didn't stop
protesters from showing up with megaphones and shouting obscenities hey how you doing man hey
what are you guys doing out here today he's not saying anything just staring at us you
don't know how kate steinle uh killer got off with a jury it's people like this that we have here
in austin it's basically an ad drunk to san francisco you're protesting kate steinle
hey what brought you out here today sir you know my name so maybe he'll talk to me i'm just trying
to talk to you guys what's up i'm a person too you know now he's doing this thing where you you uh
this is very popular with the left where they bump you you know you saw that was shyla buff
bumping people excuse me excuse me doing that thing they did it to alex are doing it to oh and
they do it everywhere uh so i guess we're both crackers this is really strange yeah all right
i'm gonna just smile and and bang into you and say excuse me and it's not aggressive at all okay
okay what is this is so aggressive like honestly what is the big deal why are these guys wearing
masks you won't even talk to me like why can't we talk if we were if we were like we would get
along masks you would throw me out you would beat my ass if we were at a bar you'd beat my ass
yeah there's a guy with his hand on the trigger uh standing right behind these guys looking at
on and he's got a mask with a hammer and sickle on it they're saying are you afraid you should be
afraid and uh it's not like in what wearing a trump hat is a safe thing to do suddenly you're
against the second amendment when did i say that well you are the one that's saying this is not
exercising the second amendment it is assault with a deadly weapon it is brandishing a weapon
those are felonies i'm literally surrounded by a bunch of guys compounded by the fact they're wearing
masks because they know that they're breaking the law or about to or want to oh my gosh look
at this guy he's scared are you not trying to intimidate me is that not your purpose out here
so all i'm trying to do is to get to the cage silently march
and as he tries to walk around them we're trying to honor dead people and this is they create a
wall with their shields or sticks and their firearms with you guys seriously kind of like the uh
black knight from monty python done shall pass like pharmaceutical drugs like an aggressive
like he was as well somebody needs to cut them down to size do you know that you all are adults
you're behaving like children you know that you're behaving like children yeah gay frogs
right atrazine why don't you read a study before you come out here and cover your face what are
you doing dude aren't you a journalist now you're blocking my reed to free speech rights free speech
yeah kind of like the washington post put her facebook all those yeah they don't
no free speech for other people rami they encourage rami with your wooden weaponized
people using weapons against the media y'all so do i literally have to go in here and then
you guys have to assault me and get arrested by these guys is that what has to happen right here
because you hate me so much even though you don't even know me or anything about me
and you cover your faces why do you cover your faces at least this guy has enough courage to
not have his face covered why won't you guys uncover your face with a peaceful streets project
so are these guys not peaceful then yeah don't talk to me so you're with the peaceful streets
project that's why your face is uncovered why is there's faces covered so they can punch you
and get away with it all right here i go that's right here i go literally they won't let me in
here this is obviously insane oh my god i can't even we're the police i'm in care right now you
know the police were johnny on the spot whenever we were there whenever you got people who were
protesting for the right to open carry carrying a black powder rifle which is legal by the way
open carry and the police arrested those individuals but they don't they don't care if these guys if
guys with masks and firearms and sticks and shields are there they don't care about that interesting
how what nazi scum nazis are socialists just like you how am i a nazi scum you are a nazi scum
what just happened to you who maced you i don't know she ran like she maced me and then she ran
the other way antifa was it antifa hopefully hopefully some of these violent protesters
are being arrested here all right we're being protected out here antifa is getting out of
control antifa is now getting totally out of control here all right so the police have shown
up they are walking their bicycles which they also use kind of as shields in this particular
kind of situation they were beating people are you all right sir yes did you see the mace people
i didn't see no mace yeah i didn't smell no you saw the mace people i saw the mace jim moe
and one chick just elbowed me you got hit you got elbowed i did you got mace too yes you got elbowed
in the chest it looks like they may by the antifa people they're macing people attacking
and you know there's there's more the antifa people there than there are i think uh people who
are there to honor kate steinley she'll talk both of us and to draw attention to the miscarriage
of justice man that was having a conversation with us that these people are violent and then
it happened so this is what we expected with these people so this is one of the antifa members
who just got arrested and um he's still telling people to f off outside the car he's got an ear
piece in i'm wondering why that guy has an ear piece in this is an antifa protester out here
with an ear piece in that's very strange all right if you want to see that we've got an article up
at info wars dot com antifa violently protest of a royal for a woman killed by illegal alien
and we also have the video uh that is unedited in the full video we have up on alex jones channel
this is what we're seeing over and over again and that is the attempt to intimidate people
the mainstream media doesn't care about that we see here's an example of this you know we'd look at
this white teen who was tortured the guy who has an iq of a four-year-old and there were three black
people he's been let off kate steinle's murder has been let off not even charged with manslaughter
just let off uh that's what we see happening the death threats against the fcc chairman
over net neutrality they just leave that up no problem they leave that up meanwhile youtube takes
down poland the polish government's video exposing the migrant invasion and say this is bad policy
it's coming from the e you we're not going to allow that to happen here in poland that's taken down
by youtube essentially isolated in a purgatory they they left it up but they told people no no
you can't watch this content matt in ohio you're on the air another matt go ahead yeah hey listen
i just wanted to say real quick i'm a long time listener of uh in fours and i i just wanted to
say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic and that really is a great

these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing well thank you my favorite

we'll come back on david night on this sunday december the 10th 2017
we're going to get back to this event yesterday it was a memorial service in honor of kate steinley
to draw attention to the injustice that happened in san francisco but as you saw if you're watching
that last segment you saw that the hateful violence of antifa is not limited to california
we have quite a few people here in austin that are just like that but it's also a story of
all across this country we have the situation where the three black teens captured a young white teen
and tortured him he's got an IQ of a four-year-old tortured him and filmed it they thought it was
great they put it up on social media and the judge basically let them plead guilty to a hate crime
aggravated battery and intimidation but let them off without any prison time to just get
to community service he said i'm not sure that you'd come out of prison any better well that's not
the point there's a punishment element there's a message that needs to be sent that we're not
going to allow you to get away with no punishment that's the message that he's sending certainly
they're not going to be any better and nobody else is going to be any better if they realize
that they can take somebody with the IQ of a four-year-old torture them and pay no penalty for
that 200 hours of community service whatever that means they dropped charges of kidnapping
which would have given them serious time but basically give them a walk students meanwhile
in a coffee shop at a university this is in a bronx campus a social justice warrior got them
booted out of for them university they're in a coffee shop and they had the audacity to wear a
trump make america great again hat and so that violated their safe space policy they were thrown
out of the coffee shop they said we weren't even talking politics we were talking about final exams
they said get out five minutes as a worker i'm protecting our customers you're wearing
hats that are completely violate the safe space policy you have to go that is the attitude
and the training that results in what we just saw with these antifa students
and austin attacking oh and short aggravated assault brandishing a firearm wearing masks
while they were doing it body blocking him checking him uh hitting him from behind hitting him from
in front saying excuse me you know the shallow buff approach and then look what happens on social
media we've had twitter this is an article from drum coursey this last week on info wars twitter
allowing death threats against the fcc chair pie ahead of the net neutrality vote listen to the
things that twitter thinks are okay remember they banned roger stone because he criticized cnn
and uh they leave people up it wasn't the language that he used it was the fact that he
criticized cnn but listen to the language the people who are threatening the fcc commissioner
say and this is okay with twitter they leave this up i hope you get assassinated another one i have
your address i will go to your house for answers if this passes another one people will murder you
congress trump and they'll put your heads on spikes there's already talk and people are getting ready
so if you want to live leave our internet alone these are the idiots who have been brainwashed
by the press brainwashed by their universities and they feel that it is absolutely okay to be violent
and that is reinforced by the judges who let them off the judges who let off the illegal aliens
uh like the one that killed kate steinle here's some more tweets we should rape his wife and
tie him up with a tape logged on his mouth hear him cry while we have some fun another one kill
yourself another one reminder i hope bad things happen to you and your family another one i hope
you're killed children get cancer and another one someone needs to walk behind adjit and inject him
with bleach or introduce a meat cleaver to his skull and short i agree he's a horrific person
and he deserves the absolute worst finally if net neutrality actually gets repealed you will be the
most hated person in america you best delete all your social media and get plastic surgery now because
if anyone recognizes you after that you're going to get the blank kicked out kicked in or hopefully
killed this these are probably teenagers who are not being censored by twitter by social media
but who gets censored the polish government by youtube what did they say they had a video that
said europe opens its eyes and admits that we are right that the polish government the problem
is connected with what the west of europe is struggling with decades of a policy of multiculturalism
and political correctness our government chooses a responsible way to fight the problem of illegal
immigration the short presentation was flagged by youtube as being age and appropriate that's
the way that they censor they say wow we still left it up there but we just flagged it as age
and appropriate why would that be age and appropriate why is it language like we just saw
on twitter why isn't that age and appropriate why do they allow isis videos up why do they
allow death threats up why does the judiciary allow tortures of disabled teenagers to go free
they say of course you know when they label it as age and appropriate that means that you
don't have any comments it can't be shared it can't be embedded it doesn't get any view count
it doesn't get any user ratings nobody can find it we've had them do that to us for things that are
not violent to say what they call a limited state essentially purgatory as we point out on news wars
purgatory for content deemed as offensive or extremist by faceless information gatekeepers
that's the weaponized media and the weaponized media of course
is part of the social media because the old dinosaur media whatever you want to call them
nobody is paying that much attention to cnn to abc nbccbs where the real power is where the real
censorship must be is on social media and this is crony censorship if the government were to come
in and shut things down some people might wake up even some liberals at that point might wake up i
don't know maybe they wouldn't maybe their hatred has blinded them so much they wouldn't wake up even
if the government were to directly censor people that day is coming soon make no mistake about it
but they don't want to head on with anybody what they want to do
is have their corporate surrogates who operate under a position of crony capitalism they want
them to do the censorship we've seen this before when i've been involved with the third party
wanting to get into debates and of course we had to jump through hoops that the democrats and
republicans never had to jump through to get on the ballot once on the ballot the debates are being
run by a private corporation usually it was a media association some kind of newspaper
or a news association would run the debates and they would choose to exclude us arbitrarily
and we would say uh how how can you just we would appeal to the government they say well it's a
private organization they can do whatever they want who gave them that power oh that would be
the government run by the republicans and the democrats would give them the power
of censorship over other people to decide who's going to be included and who isn't
and of course the government was there at the beginning funding through incutel the cia's venture
capital firm and other means funding the creation of google and facebook helping to give them a
default monopoly and then standing back and proclaiming innocence as they shut other people
down as the surrogates for the government they have to go a little bit further they have to
shut down all political debate do it with algorithms and then once they do that then you'll have the
hardcore censorship that'll come straight from the government just like it does in china but right
now they're using their surrogates that's the weaponized media that's the media that doesn't
complain when weapons are used against real media when they're used against people like

waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
welcome back i'm david night and this sunday december the 10th 2017 a lot of things have happened
in the last couple of days a lot of fake news coming after president trump and we've also had
another sexual harassment case this time coming after a judge in the ninth circuit court the
liberal court that gets overturned and all the rest of them combined i believe i'm just kind of
guessing because it gets overturned so frequently but it's one of the judges there unfortunately he
is supposedly the conservative at the court now being outed for sexual harassment we'll tell you
about that as well as some updates to the latest sexual harassment circus that is going on in
washington dc before we do real quickly i'll let you know about some of the sales we have at info
war store dot com that's what funds this news program as well as the other programs that we've
added of course i have a program monday through friday at eight a.m. in the morning and oh inshore
we've added a program war room and the afternoon after the four hours of the alex jones show monday
through friday that's another three-hour program we're able to do that because of your support
and we're proud to offer you products that support your health so you're able to support
free and independent media at the same time you support your health and your family's health
dna force is now 33 off at infowarstore.com it's a great time to stock up on that that's a big
savings folks because it's a very expensive product to produce so the price is high on that
typically higher than most of our other supplements because of biopqq it's a very difficult and
expensive ingredient to add there are a lot of clinical studies if you go to infowarstore.com
you can read about biopqq and find out about the clinical studies that talk about how it
preserves your dna health and what we're talking about here is a little telomere the little end cap
on the end of your dna strand it's one of the things that scientists have found if they look at that
telomere they can predict your natural lifespan because that gradually decreases over your life
there are some things that will accelerate that and the absence of some things as they found
from some studies of some amish people who did not have a protein that makes that disappear
they found those individuals had a 10 year longer lifespan because that protein did not
eat away the telomere so there are things that you can do or things that can take away
destructive elements in your system that may be there due to hereditary instances or just
due to environment there are things that you can do that can help to prevent or to slow down the
erosion of the telomere because once that comes off it's just like the end cap off of your
off of your shoelaces once that comes off your shoelaces start to unravel and that's what starts
to happen with your dna as the telomeres disappear we also have vitamin mineral fusion drink mix

introduced alpha power so take a look at the products that we have at infowarstore.com and
we appreciate your support especially this time of year all right so we've got Al Franken
who resigned last week or maybe he didn't resign who knows we had a poll up i put a poll up on
liberty terry in my twitter site and we had about 11 and a half thousand people vote on it 50%
of them think that he's planning on staying i think he is i think it's looking to him as well
as to other people that roymor is going to win in alabama they are now even having their polls
come back this is that line from the hill saying more bumps jones from the top of an alabama senate
poll jones has never been on the top of any of these alabama senate polls this is one of the most
republican areas most pro trump areas you're going to find and they're now moving from the push poll
stage we do polls and you pick the mix of voters democrat and republican to get the outcome that
you want then you tell everybody look my candidate is winning so they went through this push poll
stage and now it's not worked it hasn't worked they realized it's not working and they're going
into the damage control stage where they tell people yeah we we knew that roymor was going to win
and so now this is uh very telling i think when you see the hill and others start to come out with
this and the fact that he is getting so desperate that he is bringing in cori booker and the uh
governor of massachusetts devol patrick campaign for him after having criticized the more campaign
for having steve bannon come down to call steve bannon a carpet bagger uh do you think that the
senator from new jersey and the governor of massachusetts as liberal as they are might be
considered to be carpet baggers by the people in alabama this is the desperation of the dug
jones campaign and of course president trump was at a rally in pennsycola which is really close to
one of the larger cities in alabama mobile alabama uh he was there he talked a good deal about
roymor and the election in alabama had a direct appeal to the voters there and he's going to be
in alabama campaigning for roymor tomorrow but i think as al franken is looking at this i think
it's very important for him there was a real revolt building against al franken with the women in
the senate especially the um you know the democrats especially the women but it was not just women but
mostly women coming after him he had to tamp that down whatever he's going to do whether he's going
to try to have a career go back to saturday night live or whatever he's going to do with his life
after this uh he had to tamp that down number one number two he never never uh admitted to doing
anything wrong he held a press conference and he criticized president trump and roymor and said
in the coming weeks i will be resigning he didn't resign and he didn't admit anything wrong he said
he called the women who accused him liars and i'm surprised that there hasn't been more reaction
from uh even the democrats on this the fact that he presented himself as a champion of women and
said they have a right to be heard but not to be believed not by al franken anyway so i think that
he's not simply just staying for the christmas party i think he's waiting for roymor to get in
and then say see uh you can't throw me out and i'm staying when in reality what is happening
is the people in alabama do not believe the charges against roymor and we have just had
and we'll talk about this more later in the broadcast uh but now gloria allred's client the
one with a phony yearbook came out and said yeah yeah some of that i wrote this is just collapsing
on them at the last minute it's it's going very badly for them and so nobody believes those charges
but everybody has seen pictures they've seen a lot of contemporary charges against al franken
a lot of stuff has surfaced from him there's no question about it with al franken and uh
he's going to try to create an equivalency there and there you can see these people showing the
the yearbook we're going to get back to that in a moment i want to talk about what's going on in
the ninth circuit court of appeals as fox news reported a prominent appeals court judge of the
ninth circuit court has been accused of sexual harassment he was the former chief judge on the
ninth circuit court of appeals his name is alex kazinsky 67 he was actually appointed by ronald
reagan somebody on the ninth circuit court of appeals was appointed by ronald reagan imagine that
and he may be a conservative i don't know maybe everybody else is drowning out all of his votes
here but this isn't actually his first rodeo he has been accused by several women two women
told the washington post that he asked them to look at pornography on a computer in his chambers
but back in 2008 he actually maintained a website with sexually explicit photos and videos and he
got called on it there was an ethics investigation and when they looked at this website he said
i know i shouldn't have put that up i'll take it down right away they go okay that's fine just be
more careful in the future that's that's the state of our government yeah just be more careful in
the future well i guess he wasn't careful enough because instead of having this public website he
just kept it on his on his computer and decided that he would show it to the women who worked for
him as they came into his office and we look at this and we look at the fact that we keep hearing
that the us house is considering changes to the law that would protect that protects the identities
politicians and pays off the women that they sexually harass this is believe it or not the
office of compliance and it was part of the congressional accountability act that they say
well we can't tell you who these people are they call it the congressional accountability act
you know just like we had the patriot act which and and we had the usa freedom act or the affordable
health care act which was not affordable didn't have anything to do with health care and now this
is the congressional accountability act which conceals when these people engage in sexual
harassment and pays up to 17 million dollars so far i'm so excited the new product at info wars

welcome back i'm david night
you know sololensky and his rules for radicals one of the rules said ridicule is the most powerful
weapon and i think that's what's behind a lot of these ad hominem attacks that we see against people
in the trump administration the most vicious ones coming from chelsea handler now attacking
sarah sanders who's the white house press secretary she's doing a great job the only thing
that they can say about sarah sanders is try to destroy her with ridicule and chelsea handler has
been all over this course i don't think that chelsea handler probably isn't smart enough to realize
to use sololensky's rule for radicals as a strategy i think she's simply looking at this and saying
hey it worked for steven cobert his show was failing until he started mocking president trump and
republicans and trump voters worked for jimmy kimmel it even works for failing saturday night
live they can keep doing the same joke every week with alex baldwin and it never seems to get stale
to their audiences so i guess chelsea handler as she got her netflix show canceled as we have
seen in the past that chelsea handler will do anything anything to try to get an audience
including taking her clothes off and admitting hey i wouldn't be doing this if i didn't want to be
fam famous and yet she comes after sarah sanders and calls sarah sanders a whore because of the
way she puts on makeup she doesn't like her makeup oh really really uh that's uh that's
chelsea handler so she gets somebody who is a comedian and uh i guess the comedian i use that
term in uh lightly they would call themselves that and they do a video now mocking sarah sanders
putting on makeup uh a morbidly obese woman putting on makeup and here's part of that video and i
want to give you the response of sarah sanders father mike huckabee after we finish this it was
a masterful and really quite truthful and compassionate takedown uh he threw some shade
on her that she deserved but it was very uh compassionate really uh kind of reaching out
to her and talking to other people uh like her but let's take a look at the latest hit piece
from chelsea handler against sarah sanders hey y'all it's me sarah huckabee sanders here's my
first makeup youtube tutorial now i like to start with a nice moisturizer i like to just
sop it up here right now my skin is dry just like portorico right before that this is a man i'm not
really sure i'm gonna go ahead get this moisturizer in my hand i'm gonna arm on this face right up
and just i don't know put it all over your face i like gravy my face is a big fat biscuit this is a
primer that goes on funny are you are you all rolling on the floor laughing at this comedian
quote unquote you can't even see it after you rub it in it's invisible just like the link to sign up
for obama care get a look at that this is just like the help i get from obama care it's invisible
to america it's republican it's strong and it's white actually it looks pretty brown all right
so you're gonna take this foundation and grab you a beauty blender oh this is a beauty blender right
here it may look like a butt plug but it's not stick a beauty blender up your butt once okay so
let's just kind of leave this this is the this is the left and you want to know why we have so much
perversion and sexual harassment there is because women are like that if that is in fact a woman i
don't know scroll a little bit to the end so people can see the end result here of this quote
unquote comedian fortune feimster is the person's name not sure if that's male or female and i'm
not sure that that's funny certainly isn't funny to me uh there we go that's the end result of this
child in front of a camera rubbing makeup all over his or her face uh to make fun of sarah
sanders who is taking down the press every day left and right like a boss and all they can do
is try to make fun of her putting on her makeup here's what uh mike huckabee had to say of course
sarah sanders is his daughter here's what he has to say when people asked him about that
really quickly though to another topic and that is late night host chelsea handler she
as i'm sure you saw made i thought a disgusting mocking video of your daughter press secretary
sarah sanders uh and this is my thing governor as you know i have very little crossover politically
with your daughter but i have to tell you i think she's doing an incredible job in a very difficult
role and i was sickened by this display of just anti-feminism backfires on the rest of the stuff
that they're doing backfires on chelsea handler which her reaction as both a politician and also
father well as a father you never like to see this kind of stuff on your kids but you know my
daughter's an adult she's uh lived in the political arena her whole life she understands it she gets
it she doesn't particularly like it but it doesn't get to her like i'm sure chelsea handler wishes it
did uh my daughter's a very balanced person she wakes up every morning uh to a loving husband
to three adorable children whose arms circle her neck and it's something that gives her a balance
that i i feel sorry for chelsea handler it's not something she understands her vicious attacks are
beginning to backfire on her and you know she's called a late night host i think it's so late now
that she's not on anymore well the thing is she's moving into the realm of keith olbermann
where she just no longer people can take her seriously but honestly i i feel sorry for her
and i owe her an apology because last week in talking about some other vicious things she said
about my daughter i said well yeah she's almost my age she you know she needs to kind of start
mellowing out and then i realized she's nowhere near my age she just looked like it and i thought
that's unfortunate and and i'm not saying that to be mean but i no seriously and i'm trying to be
honest here when people are bitter and they live their lives in anger in hostility to what others
it shows it it just it takes away accountants that that people need and and i'm not trying to be funny
honestly people who are bitter and angry and lash out at others and have no sense of personal
balance and joy um it's unfortunate and and that's why i say with all sincerity i feel sorry
for her i don't envy her and i guarantee in my daughter deaden nope mr more you know that's
interesting hang on that's uh yeah that's where i'll read we'll get to that in a moment yeah i
was reminded i can't remember who it was who said it but uh there was a a wit who once said by 40 we
all have the face we deserve i think that's what what mike ikebi was talking about what he said
i thought she was my age and he was saying the bitterness that is inside of telsie handler
just bubbles up to the surface in a very ugly way she doesn't realize the blessings of life
of a home a family of children and she is viciously striking out just as her show was
canceled he pointed out it's gotten so late that it's now i disappeared uh it is now late as in
dead and gone the uh telsie handler show that was on netflix it's canceled so uh this is why
she's she's desperate she says she's going to focus on politics um i don't know if that's really
the focus of before she's done but it's backfiring just as the attacks against president trump or
president trump are backfiring one of the people uh coming responding to telsie handler on twitter
a lot of people uh kicked back on her uh i said glad to see how much of a strong feminist you are
telsie handler by promoting positive body image of other females uh because she said this woman
deserves to be taken down she is pure evil so she's going to do anything that she can
and to destroy sarah sanders personally she's not evil she is able to restore some rationale to
these press conferences where it is nothing but weaponized irrational attacks against president
trump but um anyway my click would be is right these vicious attacks are starting to backfire
and here's another one that backfired a vicious attack against president trump and uh it was from
dav weigel washington post reporter he tweeted out pictures of an empty stadium as president
trump was making his speech in pizzicola florida except that it was simply a hit job and as zero
hedge points out a day after cnn botched their hit job on president trump and his son uh which came
a week after the erroneous abc report on general flan sent stocks tumbling which came a month after
bloomberg's justin sink launched coy gate during president trump's trip to japan then we have this
guy dav weigel tweets out photo of an empty arena uh before the trump rally it was taken
hours before the rally and of course there were a lot of people there and they took pictures of
the rally as it was underway so clearly that was um a lie he got called out on it he eventually
uh came back and apologized but president trump says uh why why aren't we uh doing something
about this and uh why are we uh and when we look at the cnn issue you got glenn greenwald out there
saying how did this mistake in the date get past all these different people they said no action is
going to be taken against the cnn reporter who falsely reported this information against uh
president trump's son no action will be taken it was reviewed and we followed our procedures all that
means is that your corruption and your fake news is systemic it runs throughout the organization
wasn't the error of one reporter we all did that we all looked over that we all did our
non-diligence on reporting that information so they owned that they owned that but then of course
they're saying wait a minute president trump you shouldn't criticize that guy for putting out a fake
picture of your rally and saying that nobody turned up you're not entitled to do that that's
censoring free speech no they're the ones who are censoring free speech by their fake narrative

newly appointed fbi director christopher rey was on the hill attempting to save face for the bureau
clearly overcome with a biased political agenda wielding federal powers to benefit
mulars russian witch hunt hillary clinton's breach of national security obama's corrupt d o j
and combi's lapdog fbi here's what i think director rey i think peter struck head of counter
intelligence at the fbi peter struck the guy who ran the clinton investigation did all the interviews
peter struck the guy who was running the russian investigation at the fbi peter struck mr super
agent at the fbi i think he's the guy who took the application to the faiza court and if that
happened i mean think if this happened if you had the fbi working with a campaign the democrats
campaign taken opposition research dressing it all up and turn it into an intelligence document
and taking it to the faiza court so they could spy on the other campaign if that happened that is
as wrong as it gets and you know what maybe i'm wrong you can clear it all up you can clear it
all up for all of us here all the congress who wants to know and frankly all of america wants to
know you can clear it all up by release we sent you a letter two days ago just release the application
tell us what was in it tell us if i'm wrong but i don't think i am i think that's exactly what
happened and if it did it is as wrong as it can be and people who did that need to be held accountable
surely you've examined the definition and the distinction between extreme carelessness and
and also extreme carelessness and uh and and the gross negligence that's within the statute
you're really going to tell us today that you don't have an opinion on that distinction gross
negligence is the language and the statute i believe but i believe also that almost anybody
who grabbed a thesaurus would say the gross negligence and extremely careless are pretty darn
close to each other the democrats are actually scared that the whole russia investigation is
going to turn against them i mean these are pretty remarkable revelations that we saw yesterday
with christopher ray who by the way is another deep state operative he was part of the enron
prosecution with wiseman and call me and we know it's pretty clear that that was a uh an operative
prosecution that was largely discredited overturned in the district the circuit courts
and christopher ray was part of that operation yesterday he refused to answer questions about
whether this fusion gps dossier the discredited dossier was used to get visa court approval
to wiretap electronic surveillance on the trump campaign and i think it's very clear
as jim jordan pointed out yesterday in the house judiciary committee that this is at the core of
the corruption and now we find out that this judge who recused himself in the flin prosecution we
didn't know why until we found out that he is on the faiza court and could be perhaps the very one
who gave the fbi approval to wiretap trump and his campaign based on this lying fake dossier and
now we've got fake indictments out of the swamp out of these kept grand juries and the word is
miller's looking at an indictment maybe even of trump by christmas are they crazy enough to try
to pull this off when in front of god country and the whole world naked as jay birds there are all
one big crew engaged in massive fraud openly following the oversight hearing representative
tray gowdy wrote on twitter when all other institutions we trust including congress appear
to be broken we want to be able to look to the fbi i am counting on director ray to go back to work
for the blindfolded woman holding a set of scales well we'll see about that the fbi needs to begin
by investigating itself john bound reporting for info wars dot com all right and i'm david night
and we're here live and right after the break we're going to give you an update on what's

welcome back i'm david night on this sunday december the 10th you know it's amazing because
this last week we had cnn come out and say trump the promise keeper that's what's got them so upset
they never expected him to do half of what he said he was going to do and here we are a year in and
he's delivered on quite a bit of stuff in spite of the fact that you have the uniparty leaders
both republican and democrats who try to block him on every measure and even people in his own
cabinet which is interesting how he has surrounded himself with people who are against the agenda
that he campaigned on and yet he continues to outmaneuver them and shut them down and deliver
on his agenda one of these items was of course the moving the u.s. embassy to jerusalem the
announcement that he would do that but also recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel
and it got all these democrats upset they're really angry about this and here's two of them as we've
got julian assange tweets that says bernie sanders along with 90 other senators unanimously
voted to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem just this last june you know we talked about the the
jerusalem embassy act that was passed in 1995 and the senate it was passed 93 to 5 i don't
imagine if you go back and look i'm just guessing here but sanders and feinstein have been there
for so long they probably were the ones who voted for it even back in 1995 and since then
we've had all these presidents not doing what they said they were going to do they would promise so
that they could get elected they would promise certain interest groups and that's the key thing
to understand here whether you agree with this or not understand the way the politicians lie to us
and the way these people are complicit because we saw the same thing happen on the republican side
with obama care they kept coming out and saying we're going to get rid of obama care we're going
to campaign on that we're going to have votes to shut it down and so forth but then when it could
really pass the republicans refused to vote for it and so you see on the democrat side
they kept promising their constituents in areas where they had a lot of jewish voters who wanted
to see this happen the majority of americans don't really care more than 50 of americans don't care
where the embassy is or they think that it was already in jerusalem they already thought we'd
recognize that as a capital but there's about a quarter who are very strongly for and another
quarter they're very strongly against and these people are people that could be used
when it comes time to run for office diane feinstein was one of these she's out there saying
this is a terrible decision it is dangerous there's a reason that for the last several decades all
these presidents have not done this and now you've done this because he said he would and you said
you were going to do this and you got elected and you took money from these lobby groups who
wanted the embassy moved you voted for it multiple times diane feinstein and now you're outraged
because donald trump actually did it and that's what we see all the time we see it on our issues
as well that's the way these people govern and that's the thing that is so amazing to us and so
refreshing and so infuriating to them bernie sanders says there's a reason why none of these
presidents would do this this is going to undermine the peace process and uh bloominthal out of
connecticut and so on they all are saying the same thing and then you've got trump's action
in terms of shutting down the illegal executive orders of brock obama in terms of stealing
hundreds of millions of acres and trump just reverses a small part of a couple of these
in utah the bears ears and the grand staircase escalante national monuments they're not monuments
they don't want to go through the whole process of declaring a national park instead what he did
was he went back and he found an obscure law that hadn't been used never used in this way it was
never intended to be used in this way the antiquities act which was set up to preserve land that uh
was some kind of indian antiquities or whatever to preserve a small area there so it would not be
alluded by people who are looking for souvenirs and so forth to protect that area the famous
the famous devil's tower that you see out there was done that way and they only uh it took uh like
a couple hundred acres around devil's tower they didn't take hundreds of millions of acres
which is the way obama used it because obama wanted to lock up these lands for federal control
and that truly is stealing our land stealing the people's land that's what the whole bundy issue
is about the fact that the federal government owns 80 to 90 percent of the land in some of these
western states and they're going to use it for their crony capitalist buddies they're going to
sell this as a senator whether you're harry reid or you're john mccain if you're part of that corrupt
establishment you can pass that over to some foreign corporation as john mccain did the tonto
national forest obama didn't protect that they're going to turn that into a massive crater and it's
being turned over to a foreign corporation this is something that has historical significance to
the indians cultural significance to them religious significance to them it is a natural
area that was recreational area that other people wanted to preserve instead it's turned over to
a foreign corporation it's going to strip mine it you'll be able to see the hole from space
and that's what they want to do throughout utah that's why they were running all the ranchers off
that's why uh while clive and bundy took a stand all the other ranchers in that area have been run
off they said from where i am all the way to the pacific ocean they run all the ranchers off
because they want to take this land they can use it for the uranium they can use it for solar power
projects with the chinese you name it they've got a long list of things that they want to use it for
personally as part of the agenda 21 idea they're going to lock us in the cities the rest of the
area is going to be off limits so when president trump rolls back just a little bit of these two
projects where obama misused a law and did it by executive order and so president trump came in
and with his executive order he repealed it and so patagonia the people who sell clothing uh for
those of you who are outdoors remember this as you're shopping it was patagonia who comes out
and says the president stole your land that's right but they didn't say which president it was
obama who stole our land uh not president trump patagonia posted a small message underneath
a message on his website calling trump's executive orders shrinking utah's bears ears and grand
staircase escalante national monuments quote an illegal move no it was obama's moves that were
illegal but this is the way we're seeing the react that they react to this even the people
like diane feinstein bernie sanders and others who have voted time and time again to move the
drusselm embassy are outraged when president trump actually does what he says he's going to do
and that's why you've got these journalists coming back and attacking president trump when
he exposes this false narrative and again why would this guy think it was important to tweet
out an empty stadium well it's because he wants to ridicule the president he wants to mock him oh
look nobody showed up to his rally uh no actually they did but then when president trump did that
you have these other journalists backing up the washington post uh the guy who tweeted this stuff
out he apologized and he retracted it but the other people are saying he's a great reporter
he's a fantastic guide to this political age i would say he is the icon of this political age
the hit and run false attack another one dan fifer says trump is attacking dav waggle because
he is sad in vain so it continues on or another one tommy v tore i don't know who he works for
the irony of this clown wanting someone fired for misrepresenting a crowd size is too much
and yet they were the ones aren't they who made such a big deal about the size of the inauguration
crowd and went on and on and on about it why did they do that why did they do that well
that was their intent their intent was to ridicule another one jessica valente the president of the
united states targeting a reporter for mass harassment is a much bigger deal than a reporter
mistakenly tweeting a photo why why is it a bigger deal why is it the president to again they every
time he makes a comment every time he points out how they are lying in a weaponized way for their
own political agenda when he points out that they are not objective that they're highly politicized
and partisan when he points that out they go furious and they accuse him of being a tyrant
who wants to shut down free speech now he has a bully pulpit he has a right to speak as well
and this other guy cryol griffin says the president calling for a journalist to be fired
seems like a public threat to the first amendment see that's where they're always coming with this
and it's like no you know gelling him would be a threat to the first amendment or maybe
destroying his business as these people support with the gay wedding cake issue right who's who
has free speech can you compel other people to do things that they don't want to do see when you
jail people or you shut down their businesses but when you say hey this guy ought to be fired or you
ought to fire these players who are disrespecting the national anthem the flag veterans at these
football games that's just good business advice for these people advice that they won't take why
because the nfl just like the washington post cnn they're highly politicized and they care more
about their politics than succeeding they'll be willing to let the nfl burn down just like
they'll burn down cnn and washington post and we'll be glad to see it matt in ohio you're on the
year another mat go ahead yeah hey listen i just wanted to say real quick i'm a long time listener

you're listening to the alex jones show
he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones
welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host
we have a couple of sales i want to tell you about before we go back to the pentagon
trying to figure out where all the money and troops went they have they have lost
trillions of dollars worth of money and 44 thousand dollars of 44 thousand dollars 44 thousand
soldiers yeah it's that bad uh when you get government decided here's here's the problem
with washington when it has grown to the cancerous size that it is now there's absolutely no way that
anybody can control it and we're seeing this a good example this is the pentagon uh how the
purpose of government has been perverted and it is absolutely totally unmanageable unmanageable
before we get back to that though i just want to remind you some of the sales we have an info
war store dot com we have dna force 33 off at infowarstore.com this is an advanced formula
designed to help energize mitochondrial function and sustain healthy cell cycles take a look at the
research on biopqq there's hundreds of clinical studies showing biopqq and how effective it is
that is why dna force is such an expensive product and so difficult to produce and a 33
percent discount off of that is a massive saving so take advantage of that right now it is something
if you look at the studies that is very important for your health it can have a great deal of benefit
for your health at any age also vitamin mineral fusion drink mix has been 50 off for a while it
is selling so quickly we're going to have to take this off very uh in the next day or so
i'm not sure if this is the last day or if it's going to be ending at the beginning of the week
but it is now 50 off it is our multivitamin and mineral formula you can put it in a drink mix it
tastes great the way it is or you can add whatever you want to make it taste uh you know to to conform
to whatever your tastes are and you don't have to swallow a lot of pills that's what i like about
vitamin mineral fusion drink mix now 50 off finally super blue fluoride free products 50
percent off that's our toothpaste our mouthwash again it doesn't have fluoride which can be harmful
if you look at the instructions on a typical fluoride toothpaste it says hey if you swallow this
stuff contact poison control we don't want to poison you we've been trying to warn people
and give them water filters so they can filter out the fluoride that is put into the water
source there's been numerous studies showing how that's harmful but iodine is actually very good
and it fights bacteria along with nano silver i don't think you're going to find any other
toothpaste anywhere that has nano silver it's a great way to kill bacteria that cause gum disease
the gum disease causes tooth loss and it also causes heart disease and super blue fluoride
free toothpaste is a great tasting toothpaste so try it now if you haven't tried it's 50 off
you don't have a thing to lose i guarantee that if you haven't tried this uh you're going to love it
and if you have tried it you love it that's a great time to stock up on it 50 off super blue
fluoride free toothpaste products mouthwash and so forth at infowarstore.com and we thank you for
your support let's take a look at what's going on with the pentagon again one of the few legitimate
uses of the federal government under the constitution is to defend the country but even that legitimate
use can be abused if it is taken to extremes and as zero hedge points out the spirit of this country
is totally adverse to a large military force they didn't say that thomas jefferson said that
he said that in a letter he wrote in 1807 but what do we have now we have a global force
to enforce the american empire and as i point out the united states has military personnel
in nearly every country in the world ranging from two liaison officers in fiji to tens of thousands
from all of the service branches in japan and germany according to the report has it made us
safer i don't think so when we are at war in seven different countries i don't know how we
continue to afford that i don't know how that makes us safer i don't know that how that makes us freer
or more prosperous and i say but perhaps the most important and equally absurd part of this is one
considers the original beginnings of our humble republic envisioned by people like madison and
jefferson is the fact that america's worldwide military presence is so big that the pentagon
itself can't track how many us service members are deployed or where this is something that is
coming out of stars and stripes the military newspaper and the headline i said this is not
the onion the headline is report 44 000 unknown military personnel stationed around the world
so the us military has more than 44 000 troops across the globe the pentagon claims it cannot
track according to a recent report they are labeled as unknown and again this is not classified it
isn't like oh we can't tell you where they are they put down unknown and so stars and stripes is
saying uh what's going on here so they they asked some officers about this they said um well uh
we're looking into it they said recent press conferences they've said well we have about
2000 troops in syria but that was four times the previously acknowledged figure so then an army
spokesperson told reporters that 4 000 troops were deployed to syria after which he awkwardly walked
back the statement that less uh less than 30 seconds later saying uh uh i'm sorry i misspoke
there there are approximately 500 in syria so what is it is it 2004 500 they don't really know an army
spokesman talking to stars and stripes said our commitment is to be as transparent as we can
within the constraints of operation security but it's also the case so it's not just classified
stuff it says also the case that the pentagon acknowledged in a statement that it has no
good way to track how many service members are stationed overseas where they are and when they
were there according to stars and stripes there is no one personnel system in the defense department
that tracks a daily location of the personnel so it isn't just oh it's classified and so i
want to look at this and say um you know they're looking at the missing money in 2015 alone they
had a staggering six and a half trillion dollars in funds unaccounted for out of their budget 2.8
trillion of wrongful adjustments occurring in just one quarter somebody should show this report
to um bob corker who said he would not spend another penny uh he would not allow the deficit
to go up by one penny just remind him that uh we've we've got about nine nine and a half trillion
dollars missing here so maybe if he wants to be uh mr fiscal hawk maybe he should start looking at
the defense department but i don't look at these 44 000 soldiers now they don't know where they are
i mean are they like marooned on a japanese island or something since world war two where did they go
they don't know because it's such a big bureaucracy and that's the point
if you want to have better government we're going to have to have smaller government
we're have to go back to a government that's the size of the constitution it isn't going to help us
to have campaign spending limits or federal campaign finance if you've got a black hole
of power and money you are going to draw the most corrupt people and programs into that
and there's nothing you're going to do to stop it no reporting system no system of prohibitions
when you're talking about tens of trillions of dollars to be had by any criminal who gets
influence and peddling in washington dc it's going to happen and no prohibition is going to stop it
the only prohibition is going to stop it is to get the money and the power out of washington
and back to the people to decentralize it that was the original plan the original plan was not
to have us be an occupying force in every country in the world the original plan was for america
to not be an empire the original plan was for citizens to have the ability the training to
defend this country when and if that was necessary and this is an absolute gargantuan distortion
it is like a metastasized cancer and that is every aspect of our government but of course
pentagon especially we see the national defense authorization act always gets passed and they'll
put anything in there and get it passed that's why you see so many corrupt things finding their way

live from austin texas broadcasting
welcome back i'm david and i don't want to be talking to roger stone of course an info wars
contributor you find him on the war room monday through friday that begins at 3 p.m to 6 p.m and
roger is on there pretty much every day aren't you roger i think for one hour but i want to talk
to roger today about a couple of things that are happening because roger always knows what's going on
the inside baseball and washington and he wrote an article for daily color talking about the time
it's time for real net neutrality you know roger when i was talking about the news earlier looking
at the death threats to fcc commissioner pie i mentioned the fact that they shut you down for
nothing and yet these are people saying hey we should sneak up behind him and inject him with
bleach we need to kill him kill his family all that stuff is left up there they put this term
up their net neutrality just like they had the congressional accountability act which provided
a 17 million dollar slush fund to hide the sexual assaults of congressmen we now have this thing
called net neutrality they always they always come up with these wonderful labels because that's the
high ground for their arguments isn't it yeah no it's it's uh as they say bass akward uh it is um
ironic that they have grabbed the moral high ground in this argument let me try to break
this down david the net neutrality rules passed under barack obama are anything but the only
neutrality that they provide for is for the the isp's the service providers comcast verizon at and
t it guarantees their equal access and equal treatment but it leaves untouched the google's the
facebook's the amazon's the twitter's they're free to censor or defame conservative contributors
uh to silence our voices entirely precisely what's happened in my own case now i feel sorry for
agit pi the fcc commissioner because every single day even though i'm still not on twitter
you will find threats to kill me disfigure my wife kill my children kill my grandchildren kill my
dogs go back in time and kill everybody the all of your ancestors exactly yeah that's that's
introductory and those people are not banned they are still very much on twitter so um the new net
neutrality rules provide for real protection of the first amendment and free speech so when you go
online and you see liberals talking about net neutrality that's the last thing they want uh
they want to continue to censor voices like alex jones or info wars bright bar daily caller big
league politics uh they are uh they're manipulating the algorithms they're using a a technique called
shadow banning they are attempting to provide us unequal access to this vibrant and important
media uh the that's right we just had julien assange tweet out today he said the the ai revolution
will not be televised because they will use ai to censor people's speech about what is going on
that's what we're now seeing you're talking about the algorithms uh to censor people and it's what
we saw what was it uh two or three weeks ago when you had the twitter executive going before
congressional testimony and uh giving congressional testimony they said wait a minute we saw this
story from info wars uh why was that there why wasn't that well we took care of that we took it
out well why did it take so long well let's talk about that privately congressman it's out in the
open they're talking about us and others by name this is where the censorship is coming
confirm it's coming from the people who are pushing this so-called net neutrality thank goodness for
the election of donald trump and the appointment and majority of commissioners at the FCC who
understand this issue we are going to strike a blow for freedom here very very shortly yes very
important people understand where that is is coming from and what you know we look at this
and we look at the case that's being argued before the supreme court right now that we've
seen several of these where you have a gay couple come in and say we want a photographer
or we want somebody who's doing a wedding uh to uh to be at our wedding and they say no
i find that offensive that's my personal choice not to do that and they say but you must do that
and yet they don't whatever you think about that particular case why if a small company
an individual local baker or photographer must do this because they have a marketplace here
why aren't those same rules being applied to these massive social media companies uh like
youtube twitter facebook or google itself why aren't those same rules being applied to them
when they have a de facto monopoly why shouldn't they have to evenly serve everybody that's the
the question that i think anybody's asking well it's time for these big internet companies to be
regulated like a utility i mean at&t is a private company but you cannot be denied a telephone look
i'm for individual freedom that's the right to marry anyone you want it's also the right to either
deliver the the wedding cake or not deliver the wedding cake depending on your individual view
i hope both of these things equally if we are for individual personal freedom it must
to extend in this area as well for too long libertarian and conservative voices have been
silenced on the internet we have seen repeatedly the demonetization of youtube videos by
conservative commentators and voices like alex jones and others uh enough is enough uh donald
trump selection is going to allow us to grab back free access of the internet for everyone by the way
right under these rules liberals and progressives could not be censored either i'm for free speech
for everyone david that's right and when we see the mainstream media is we have several times it's
almost a daily occurrence we have some major story where they lie about the data or they
misrepresent it uh saying oh look this came out at uh before president uh trump was elected we had
conversations uh that we've now oh no that happened uh later on and we already knew about that or
just as i did in the last uh a couple of days saying that uh president trump's son was uh
trying to get wiki leaks information and it turns out that it already been
tweeted out a day earlier somebody sent him an email he said i hadn't even seen he said people
are sending me emails all the time but when they put this stuff out and president trump exposes it
and criticizes them for these false attacks they always accuse him of censorship it's not censorship
yeah no look it's laughable the hypocrisy of the left is extraordinary you will remember when
alex jones and i first raised the questions about hillary clinton's health um this wasn't
based on something we'd seen online this is based on our own two eyes you can see her coughing fits
you could see based on her two eyes as well because they were going in different directions at
certain times right right she needed help to get up one flight of stairs yeah uh now suddenly
that was off limits we were we were denounced the clinton campaign attacked alex by name they put out
a written statement accusing me of making the whole thing up now however you see the mainstream
media viciously attacking don trump over his health oh he's sick he's not well he's crazy
he's non-compassmentist that's perfectly all right look this is laughable yeah i predict this on the
alex jones show months ago if muhler uh shoots and misses which i think he certainly shoots
how that plays out we don't know then they will move to the 25th amendment strategy
removing don trump because he's quote unquote crazy which he most certainly is not uh but you see
senator corker you see don limone from cnn you see all these voices uh more and more uh teeth
oberman although i don't know how he tweets from a straight jacket must be interesting
you know this whole idea that trump is uh is not mentally well that's perfectly acceptable
commentary but when we criticized hillary's obviously frail health well we were bully boys
and of course it's the uh it's the vast left-wing conspiracy that they keep repeating over and over
again the the russian conspiracy for which they have no proof whatsoever and they cannot get away
from that that's we're gonna talk about that when we come back want to ask roger stone about a
column that he had about the bad advice that president trump is getting from his lawyers also
want to ask him about the reports that retired cia agents working with blackwater founder
uh claimed that the that hr mcmaster approved the spy job on the trump family won't be right

live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
welcome back i'm david knight and we're talking to roger stone and ask roger about this tweet
that president trump's lawyer john dowd took credit for it a mia culpa it was a head scratcher at the
very least it really got the left fired up it's another one of these uh nothing burgers that they
thought they really had something but it certainly got them talking and the fact that he would word
something like that and precisely and then take credit for saying i had control of the tweets
we're going to talk to roger about that before we do real quickly i remind you of some of the items

roger you've been saying that this tweet that went out saying i had to fire general flinn because
he lied to the vice president and the fbi that was then used by the left to say look this is
obstruction of justice he fired call me because of this and then the attorney his attorney john
dowd came out and said well i wrote that it was sloppy it was very inaccurate i mean what do you
think about his lawyers here i think the president's lawyers are giving him incredibly bad advice i
really don't think they understand the enmity of the deep state and the two-party elite duopoly
that have run this country into the ground they have every intention of removing our president
it is unrealistic for ty cob lawyer who obviously stole his name from a baseball player
tell the president that he will shortly have a letter from Mueller clearing him entirely on the
question of russian collusion i'm telling you that isn't going to happen uh instead i believe the
president's lawyers are sleepwalking him right into the blade uh this this is an extraordinary
mistake the president needs to take uh the muller inquiry more seriously this is a completely
partisan uh uh get trump effort that is not going to stop and that tweet um at least on the face of
it appears to set the president up for an obstruction charge remember previously he told us that flin
was fired because he lied to the vice president now he's suddenly saying no flin was fired because
he lied to the fbi that would of course mean that when he told comey to uh end the flin investigation
he was arguably guilty of obstruction uh so then john dowd dives on the grenade and says no the
president didn't send that i sent it this is not only sloppy but i think it's dangerous the president
needs to get real as i said in the first segment i'm convinced that if muller shoots uh and misses
that there they will then move to a 25th amendment strategy removing trump because they claim he is
non-compassmentist that he is crazy around the ben i've talked to the president he's
just as sharp as he's ever been this is a false narrative being promulgated mostly
by the talking heads on cnn but the political establishment will never rest until they can
negate the results of the last election that's what this is really about and you are not doing the
president a service by uh telling him that he's about to be cleared when in my opinion he is not
now uh the drugs report picked up my interview the new york daily news on this subject last week
for which i am gratified um but i think it's very important that the president's supporters
and the president's friends tell him the truth that his lawyers are leading him down the primrose
path to the gallows i i believe that uh with my entire heart and soul and i am deeply deeply
concerned that they are not getting the muller inquiry seriously enough you know i i think
probably his best defender maybe he needs to get rid of these guys and hire ellen dirshowitz you
know he wrote a book called trumped up he said there's nothing here there isn't any crime he can
fire the fbi director the fbi director works for him under the justice department and he said uh
and so so has uh judge napolitano he says look it's not obstruction if you're not trying to hide
something that is criminal there is no crime here and so the only thing you could say is that hey
i don't like uh i want you to go spend your your time trying to find criminals and terrorists
who are uh trying to do things here in the united states instead of going down this
rabbit trail with this that'd be perfectly legitimate to do and if you feel like the guy
is wasting resources on a political witch hunt it'd be perfectly fine to shut that down as well
because if this isn't about a crime if comey and uh muller and the rest of these people rod
rosinstein if this is a political persecution looking to get something on trump and others
with a process crime they'd be perfectly fine to shut that down there's absolutely no reason
that you couldn't do that well it's obvious from the president's tweets and some of his public
comments that his lawyers have convinced him that it's somehow improper for him to give direction
to the justice department that's false the justice department is an extension of the
executive branch the president has every right to give direct orders to jaff sessions now i personally
am opposed to the idea of firing muller although he certainly merits it because of the uh obvious
mainstream media analogy to the saturday night massacre and richard nixon it's unnecessary
david the president needs to direct jeff session give him a direct order appoint a special prosecutor
in the matter of uranium one that would immediately entail a federal investigation of mr
muller the former fbi director mr comey the former fbi director assistant fbi director andrew mccabe
and the supervising u.s attorney and the uranium one matter rod rosinstein that's right the whole
groups if those four gentlemen are under federal investigation by a special prosecutor say
andrew mccarthy or judge andrew napolitano or tray galley or some other honest broker
well they cannot possibly continue to function uh in this get trump brigade that is the special
council um it is interesting that as soon as i propose this within minutes literally vanity fair
and uh raw story the worst of the worst left-wing fake news sites we're out with stories saying
why the president should not and could not do this that's how i know it's exactly the right thing
oh i think that would be a genius move because again he doesn't have to make it look as if it's
they're going to argue obstruction if he tries to fire uh muller even though he has the authority
even though there isn't any special prosecutor law that was allowed to expire in 1999 we don't even
know the rules under which the special prosecutor is operating because there is no law and so
there isn't any process actually david we do know he's operating under no rules that's right yeah
they won't declare it yeah under the old special prosecutor law expanding the scope of his probe
requires the written permission of the attorney general this guy does anything he wants that's
right stunning and there was oversight by three judges and so forth none of that stuff applies
anymore he's just that's what everybody wishes and the most chilling piece of information this week
is the fact that the special prosecutor has subpoenaed the deuchess bank records into the
300 million dollar portfolio of real estate developments by donald trump yes what does
this have to do with russian collusion nothing whatsoever it's a witch hunt it's time for mr
muller and mr comey and mr mccabe and mr rozenstein it's their time in the barrel so to speak if you
want to get a process crime against somebody the easiest way to do it first of all is to have a
surprised deposition on them and say oh you lied on some of the details this is what they did to flint
but the next easiest thing to do is financial crimes because it is so complex and there's so
many different rules and regulations and it's subject to interpretation as anybody who has
looked at the irs rules know it is far more complicated with these international rules
and that's ultimately what they're after i think your strategy is exactly what needs to happen
roger son the idea that that they would start to investigate uranium one which is where all of
these people running this thing without any oversight without any rules without any law
they were all involved in uranium one well that's it for today's broadcast thank you again roger for
