resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones well i tell you this
civil war the globalists are trying to start in this country has gone from
smoldering to explosive we've got all these clips of top democrats on
television on msnbc on cnn at hollywood award shows rob reiner on friday
saying we're in a civil war and we're fighting nazis and we're fighting
russian agents and they know it's a fraud they're just branding their
opposition is that because they are a dying party
well last time i had these guys in uh we just kind of ran it and raved about
anti-fun intimidating people and working for soros and trying to
go around you know pointing guns at people and stuff and i in customary
fashion talked to everybody but i've i've invited the guys back to actually
get into what a civil war that went hot would look like
the different factions that could basically break out
because these guys won't get into their backgrounds but they have specialties
in that that maybe one tenth of one percent of people in the military
have had so we're going to be discussing how
tier one military operators from from from their research their view as
citizens think this is going to go down because the democrats have decided to
get violent and they said they have and through their channels they announced
the violence and then we pointed out they have
media matters again the mouth of soron the mouth of soros
say it's insane it doesn't exist none of what's happening classic military tactic
so that's all coming up in the second hour roger stone
is going to be in the third hour it is all coming up
today and of course we have the great jack posovic as well hosting the fourth
hour than the war room with oan shroyer
steven bannon complete snake on the grass the entire time
very very saddened by that he now is a darling on cnn and they talk about how
wonderful he is remember he was the white supremacist leader just a few months
ago but now he's wonderful and oh he says that the
hashtag me too will bring down trump and they just build this crescendo burning
a few of their own hollywood people as i predicted six months ago
and then create this wave and say well trumps gotta go
and it's about civil war culturally between men and women
so that's coming up today and then meanwhile etna one of the biggest
insurance companies in the world serving 23 million to share in the us alone
who helped write obama care to make you pay for it so they can increase the
prices that's a dream of these big corporations you want to know who runs
the planet it's the big banks that own the insurance companies or vice versa
and at this right up there at the top of the capstone
their top technician top ceo came out and said look
we don't even look at your request when they come in for surgery or whatever
and then it's a big firestorm oh california's investigating what do you
mean you don't even look at it and they go well don't
don't worry about that we'll tell you once we have congressional hearings
and they're going to use this as a way to roll out that it's computers
so they're so fair in fact here's a headline cnn
california launches investigation following stunning admission by etna
medical director now here's the real news from cnn
getting occasionally right from what uh earlier this year
the computer that decides if we live or die
you see they started it out about nine years ago strangely enough when obama
got in said what you want about bush he didn't put that in
where it's not even bioethics boards of doctors that decide who lives and dies
with a mix of hospital or company administrators you've got to have a
doctor signing off on the death warrant it's the thomas
watson computer and you cannot make up the richness of that little sweetheart
remember they want major halls changed from lynch hall
even though in several cases it was liberals that donated money and last
name was the irish name lynch because it sounds like lynching
that mental illness but then you can have it called the thomas
watson computer that decides who lives and dies
when he invented the first computers they're the same thing in
german death camps on record
so see there's people are scared to name lynch has nothing to do with lynching
and but but oh a computer's actually named after
the guy that got the highest award in nazi germany thomas watson the
creator of computers and then the machine named after him carries out
nazi tactics against veterans fuel your body with carnivore the new
digestive enzyme product by infowars life
digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the
bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily
absorbable components they also help prevent
discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food

carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present
in the body enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods

high meat diets just one pill with every high protein
meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of
amino acids the building blocks to your muscles

and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals

head to infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now that's infowarslife.com
live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
all right you don't want to miss this broadcast uh we've got
tier one patriot operators who don't even get into what they've done and do in
the military and for other organizations uh today when they come in
they're going to be here to talk about the second amendment a lot more but i'm
going to try to get them to talk about what things will look like in their
research view not from a classified perspective of cog
uh but from just a citizen perspective with the left out there calling
for total civil war and now saying that they put us into a civil war
and preparing to up the amount of violence that they've already engaged in
so that's in the second hour will intersperse a lot of breaking news
obviously third hour roger stone will be in studio with me co-hosting right into
the fourth hour with jack possebe another great patriot uh here uh the
big news is that hezbollah out of iran has used the fact that the u.s has
begun to pull out of most areas of syria do again moving up to the border with
israel and has shot down one of their aircraft had drones and other aircraft
coming over the airspace uh israel has
reasonably struck back against bases uh where hezbollah was attacking from uh
and has become large bombing runs and is now threatening basically to attack
iran itself if they don't back down iran has come out
and said that this is a new strategic era uh and that they'll do whatever they
want basically iran uav that entered israel airspace
seems to be an american stealth knockoff now that is just some of the news
meanwhile billionaire george soros has already donated billions to overthrow
european sovereignty and just the last week he donated
500 000 pounds and now another 100 000 pounds to try and derail briggs it
american investor uh defies critics to take total
spent on keeping uk and eu uh to over 500 000 pounds
and how is he a weird eastern european nazi collaborator
involved in our politics and involved in sovereign politics in in the uk and
then he's the one funding this baloney that all of us that want u.s sovereignty
our lower taxes are russian agents
he is the communist he has been the socialist who of course is tax exempt
he's mega wealth to control people as it always is
so that's simply incredible we're gonna get into that billionaires and athletes
freeze as winter olympics uh have record low temperatures
also vice airs documentary on black uh healing retreats for people who need a
break from white people i talked about this last week we had the clips we
never got to them now it's a big national news story
but i'm gonna air some of that in the third hour roger stone they actually
say white people shouldn't have any rights and
shouldn't be allowed to travel and i don't like seeing them and they go you
lease this property uh for your black retreat from a white person well that's
okay you talk about what the public schools and the
media have done turning some black people into beyond kkk
i mean the kkk isn't calling for black people not being able to have
passports or move around freely uh it is truly
naziistic the nazi's control where you could go and what you could do it is
it is unbelievable but it's like the left saying oh we're getting all these
people organized these professors and msnbc we played the clips last week
we're gonna block the military parade that trump wants to have
because he's not going to invade new york
or invade dc depending on where they have it that's not troops invading that's a
parade that's not tenement square tenement square again was communist
coming and attacking civil rights activists protesters who are
peacefully speaking out for free speech amazing
bunch of communists a bunch of socialists down saying oh we're going to lay in
front of the tanks like the heroes at tenement square
you're the left on the campus trying to borrow free speech you're the left trying
to go after the veterans you're the people saying
we shouldn't be able to have a parade by the way i think trump should have a
parade because the globalists don't want us to have one
i'm against a police state i'm against martial law i'm against civil war it's
the democrats calling for a civil emergency calling for martial law
calling for overthrowing the election calling for banning free speech and
doing it at campuses all over the country as they admit they are
banning halloween parties banning costume parties banning fiesta parties
banning everything to have total control
and they point their fingers at us and they say that we're the fascists no
i support our military because our military is one of the most weight
groups to the globalist threat and the globalists want to get control of our
military to use it against us and it's t that we totally engage the military
and wake the military up so they understand that duty and they
understand it better than we do on average that's why it's a natural ally
with the american people is our military and they want to drive a wedge
there they're the folks that love killing cops
they're the people that hate the military that hate flyover country that
admittedly hate this nation but now hollywood are the ones telling you how
all of us that are america firsters all of us
trying to take the sabotage controls off the country trying to end the global
of sabotage we're the traitors total bull
the dowels jumped 307 points as stocks bounce back from their worst week in
two years we're going to get into all of that but first
little steven bannon has proven himself to be a classic benedict arnold in the
vein of judice iscariot or brutus has slithered out and is giving
interviews to see it and others saying hashtag me too he thinks will bring
trump down oh what a tactical genius you are it was set up six
months ago the democrats admitted that they were unpopular with women because
of all the right connections to the clintons and the cover-ups and the
lelita express and and and all the raping and the children and all the rest of it
so as a facelift they started burning a few of their own and now he says women
need to take charge of society a classic globalist talking point by the big
multinationals who want to use you as a wedge to further break up the country
hitler said first you get the women then you got the children so follow the men
hitler targeted women told them they were in charge
so the whole issue here is that this is classical advertising
80% of advertising targets women and he's playing into that whole leftist
talking point saying this will bring down
trump he believes on his belly like a little
goblin creature dragging it like a little snake in front of them hoping to be
relevant again truly truly sickening by the
hollywood screenwriter who posed as a patriot but he was always a globalist
leftist we now learn let's go to that clip
paperback release of the new book you talk about watching the golden globe
awards with steve bannon and you got his reaction to the red carpet protest
supporting the me too movement he said quote the antra
anti-patriarchy is going to undo 10 000 years of recorded history
you watch the time has come women are going to take charge of society
and they couldn't juxtapose a better villain than trump he is the patriarch
this is a definitional moment in the culture it'll never be the same
going forward you know i think bannon despite all his
flaws is a pretty shrewd analyst of american politics and particularly
american political anxieties are national anxieties and he recognized
in those golden globe awards that this was a movement that could potentially
be an existential threat to republicans not just the majority in the house
but also to president trump and there's a wonderful revealing moment of fruity
and angst in the scene as i described bannon watching opera
where he says look if they were to roll out a guillotine right now
these ladies would chop off every set of balls in the room
which is which is a blunt bannon way of saying essentially you know this me too
movement they're coming for our manhood and i think that expressed
a lot of the anxieties that bannon that trump the people of that political
persuasion have about this this new rising movement of
of women which is really a backlash to the man that that bannon calls the
patriarch trump himself all right let's decipher that complete absolute bull
remember we told you that was actually eight months ago
that they were in the whole me too thing was a deal to bring down trump that
that was obvious they now admit that that was an alfreight and shed i
shouldn't have resigned because none of them are resigning i shouldn't have
been you know agreed to this to be the sacrificial lamb
so that's what's going on what's happening is multinationals know they've
taken the country over they want to divide us from each other
hillary was supposed to get in and in any criticism it wouldn't be that you're
racist like it was with obama now is going to be your sexist and you don't
like hillary and they're still going with that she says that every time she
opens her mouth so there's just still playing
the very same playbook they had that's why they had law and order and homeland
all these shows already produced where there's a woman president
and now they try to assassinate her she goes from being hillary to now
she's a bad trump person so all of this is propaganda just basting
emotional people men women you name it and then men
cucks are supposed to signal to women oh i know we're bad you're in charge here
you go work and you bring me food and i'll sit her on the couch
and of course she leaves you about a year because you're a cuck
i mean it's it's amazing that's not what women are looking for
and so this this this is total fraud this is scientific warfare the attack on
the family all of it and that's all that is and now
the little cuck ben and it scared the women are coming to get my testicles
and that's the idea they're always invoking violence hashtag kill republicans
women chop men's genitals off it's war guillotines cut their heads off
it's all this violent rhetoric but rob riner said we're in the last battle
of the civil war we were gliding in we were going to screw america over and
break its back forever but america woke up before we finally slid its throat
and we can't let that happen hollywood we will defeat america

you're listening to the alex jones show
live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you so much for joining us i am
your host alex jones so what have i told you that major
insurance companies for more than a decade
have been testing and now installing system-wide
computers that serve as bioethics boards now first they created bioethics boards
in the last 60 70 years as part of the eugenics movement
in western europe the uk the u.s australia new zealand
canada you name it where a board of physicians and then a board of
physicians and hospital or corporate executives
would decide who gets a liver transplant or who gets
a cadaver transplant for an achilles
heal sounds reasonable you're a big drinker
you're 65 years old there's a young person needs a liver who isn't a big
drinker not their fault we're going to give you the liver first
but once you open that door up now the computers can do whatever they want
that's the famous clip of bill gates saying
was it six seven years ago to the group of teachers he said if you don't give
that old person that last year of care you can hire 10 teachers
well he knows that's a fraud when you start cutting quality
everything implodes you always demand more quality in your civilization
and then that increases the level of service the level of viability the
level of excellence and a great example i use
this is well known by economists by the way is just 15 years ago there were
almost no nice theaters where you could eat
eat dinner and have a drink alamo draft house in austin texas made it ubiquitous
wash it nationwide and then suddenly five years ago
every theater began converting except discount theaters and now
all the old cruddy theaters have a full bar
and big huge relaxing seats and are better than alamo
that's what innovation is but they teach you in a zero-sum game
that the cake is only so big that the pizza is only so big
and that we can't innovate our way out so
there's been a bunch of big headlines out the last day the big scandal is cnn
exclusive california launches investigation following
stunning admission by etna medical director
and the etna medical director came out and said we don't look at the reports
and of course they're setting everybody up they said we look forward to
testifying in california and the congress both about this and of course i
knew what they were going to say and etna's already put out statements to
their board they put out statements to their shareholders
they're going fully to computers and they're going to use this stunt to say
see it's not a human deciding who who lives and
who dies it's a computer so everybody can wash their hands
like punch's pilot and of course where did it start that computers
would decide how much you were fed how much you were worked and when you were
finally either killed or starved to death oh it was a place called
nazi germany and the top right hand man of adolf
hitler who received the highest award in germany above hitler
look it up just just just type in thomas watson of ibm
received the highest award from hitler there's photos of him receiving it
it's like some triple iron cross with double double eagles and all that stuff
but what's key here is ibm leads and at the va
runs the thomas watson computers that are supposedly
ai when it comes to making decisions and that is who created that we all
discovered six years ago the secret death list on the va
and i told everybody at the time
by the way they've been pulled a surprise winning books written on this
ibm the holocaust you name it we've had the authors on it's a fact
hitler gave speeches with watson i mean only the person he liked as much as
margaret sang or they had a planned parenthood why she is worship on the
cover of time in newsweek is the best feminist ever because she said hall
hitler and he learned he said everything he knew from her and david
rockefeller's granddad who funded him who funds the
colesprings harbor facility today run by ibm computers so you need to understand
this and i'm not bashing ibm the company i got a family has worked for it
i'm simply pointing out that this is the facts it's incontrovertible
it's history and they think you're stupid so
seeing in though in the last couple years and others admitted this they're
leaving it as a mystery right now the computer that decides if we live or die
a serious injury leaves a loved one in coma relatives may face the hardest
decision in their lives to wait it out or turn off the life support machine
the program may help families decide what action take
either critically on it goes on here's another one probe finds more secret va
waitlist in colorado washington times still going on
trumps trying to stop it he is made a good effort to do it
double the amount of appointments that veterans are getting but there's a
culture in there that is very eugenical that blocks that so
here's the facts you can look up the national health service
uh paul watson runs every day super healthy guy he got
what was it strep about three years ago they wouldn't let him see a doctor for
a couple months he almost died coughing up blood
you have to get permission to see another private doctor and pay a lot more
so it's a two-tier system and their whole system was designed to collapse
it's always been horrible it's always been for social control and now they
admit it's collapsing cnn's headline today was
after 70 years of being a model of goodness it's collapsing
that's in the news today after 70 years after 70 years of universal health care
is the nhs at a crisis point there's the headline and then admits that it's
just all falling apart oh they need total control
they need social control now to make you you know live the way they say and then
then you'll get your health care so what did
zika lomania will say he said after we bankrupt health care with obama care
which is only increased prices massively we'll come in with single pair but
it'll still be administered by big insurance companies
and then computers so i'm gonna explain this ai computers
autonomous computers decision-making computers is the proper term
are already in control of your life on medical care
they're already all the new cars coming out all the upper end are
autonomous so robots are already in 2018
taking your life over the military admits they're rolling out all these
killer robots but the big killer robots aren't
gonna be the ones that are on the battlefield
it's the ones that decide if you live or die that run the system that tell you
in the megadopolis when you get food where you work where you travel when
you get the authorization to travel it's the nightmare model of the zeitgeist
sold to socialist as this wonderful utopia we're an all-seeing robot the
sky an electric guy runs our life but who programs it
so there's the rest of the story and it's total control it's totally evil it
needs to stop but they always sell it like oh
it's just for you know if somebody's in a coma no it's not
you'll see thousands of cases in the news i've watched parliamentary debates
even back when tony blair was in he admitted where you could have an
operable tumor on your skin you name it if you do within six months they make
you wait two years and you die
you understand that
think about that we're talking about veterans not getting knee surgeries
when they get hurt in the military here's a cane
this is their model they're taking your health care away and now
the big globalist bill gates warren buffet
and others are getting together with uh bezos to quote
save health care and everything they do is taxpayer funded tax exempt uh boondoggles
where they get your tax money on everything they do yep the dark secret
at the heart of ai even mainline scientist elon musk you name it the real
white papers all the brains say this is a nightmare it's already ubiquitous it's
deadly turn back now but i get up here and tell the public
about oh 90 of young people have chemicals in
their body to give them cancer and change their sex partially
let's y'all shut up gay frog man shut up hey hope you don't enjoy that cancer

all right i've got massive economic news huge winter olympic news north korean
news pbs host compares white house to communist east berlin
when it was always the leftist supporting communism and still supporting
north korea over the weekend saying they hoped kim jong-un's bloodthirsty
sister would physically attack the vice president so that that's all coming up
uh just amazing so we're gonna be getting to all that but i wanted to show
this article one more time there were a bunch of these last week and i barely
mentioned it that big new studies are coming out in the u k the u s
europe you name it where 86 to 90 plus percent depending on which study you
look at
of individuals in the united states and in europe and we're going to put that
article up on screen if we can place there it is gender bending chemicals
found in plastics and linked to breast and prostate cancer are found in 86
percent of teenagers bodies and it goes on to say they're in adults and even
higher levels in some cases and let's scroll down i'm going to read part of
this article here between all a is found
along with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
other chemicals that in samples of 94 teenagers found
80 plus of them had high levels of the chemicals in them
and what do they admit those chemicals do
they admit that they gender bend and they affect the brain and they affect
how your olfactory nerve smells the different
scents that are put off that are part of mammalian activity
and then it manipulates and jacks with that there's another one new scientists
gender bending chemicals found to feminized boys
now that's back in 2005 by the way that's when i first made the gay frogs
comment and i said nothing against the fact
that most of the frogs are gay the fact is they're sterile and they're dying
they then edited that then made a joke out of it
to then make sure no one had a serious debate about this
but i keep going back to this because it's such a central issue
that now they're coming out admitting all of this in 2018
but it was already admitted back in 2005 and before
it was only though in scholarly journals
so what's the bottom line here i personally do things
like take alpha power that's got natural herbs in it
that are known to counter veil the effects of this garbage that's in our
environment and i personally also take super
male vitality and people say well you've got anthroplex you've got alpha power
you've got super male which one do you like the best they're all
different formulas they all affect things differently
different people like them better one person i mean here in the office they're
split between the three products some people like super male better than

well but it is so critical that with what's going on in the
environment take x2 the good halogen they put the bad
halogens in the water and the food it bio accumulates it fries your glands on
record lowers IQs all the studies look it up yourself
and then you take real pure iodine that we've got from deep earth crystal
sources people are completely blown away by what it does
i mean it is it is it is such a game changer the weight loss the energy the
stamina it's it's crazy but if you've already got thyroid issues and stuff
everybody should check with their physician before
you take it even though you die without iodine they've artificially keep
lowering the rate they say you need the government used to put a crappy form in
the salt then they took it out because IQs had gone so low
goiter was so bad across the country especially the midwesters are not eating
seafood look that up yourself 15 IQ IQ boost within just a decade
so look it up yes there's a conspiracy to make us dumb
okay i'm done talking about that but it's very important in forestore.com
10 surprising facts about iodine absolutely
iodine salt gave us 10 year IQ boost say researchers see just i went from memory
and in a 10 year study it went up 15 points on average see my memory served
here that's the same study when there's so many of these i'm not telling you
a secret here say 15 15 points boom
boom my memory served holds that article
2013 and that was from the Centers for Disease Control
because see they were having a discussion about whether they should put it
back in the salt but oh we don't force medicate you we're a free country
we just put hydrophoresic acid a acid based weaponized form of bad halogen
to make sure it fries everything and fries your
adrenals and and and fries your your
reproductive systems it's simply incredible okay i'm gonna stop ranting
about it be sure and check out x2 today
everybody should be checking out x2 and m4'slife.com
okay let me do this let me just tell you what's gonna come up in the next
seven because i've already been ranting here
uh there's so much to get to house democrats give
democrats help with winning the GOP strongholds conservatives who vow to
stop spending keep spending we'll get to that
this is really important i'll cover this when we come back first
zombie bots are coming for lonely singles on valentine's day
and i talk a lot about this most of the bots especially the target young people
and leftist according to uh Sean parker former head of
facebook and others most of your friends on facebook and twitter are
fake if you're a leftist that's the real bots the
russians came and figured out to do this
it turned out that came on congressional hearings
in 2016 twitter came to the russians and i forget the amount with some huge
amount like 12 million they said why don't you spend this huge amount
and we'll push your stories and we'll tell you what's trending and we'll tell
you what one of your stories to push and on there was black lives matters
second amendment not because it's a conspiracy
like shiff says that's in the contract that rt released
that's what they told him to push and they signed a smaller contract i forget
to tell there's a couple hundred thousand dollars
the point is is that the bots our facebook our twitter our youtube
and they admit that most of the people in there are bots and that they go and
make leftist more depressed make them more scared try to keep them in longer
try to make them afraid to go out and then they socially engineer them
within those echo chambers so that's coming up
it's so critical because other media will report on this but just oh
those so-called sweethearts you think are reaching out to you
those things you think are actually valentine's request they're not
there it is how twitter bots are recycling cold war techniques to so
political division yeah it's it's it's it's twitter
doing it at a scale unimaginable compared to
and so they like little short things because the computers to come up with
short things that's why they started early with only a few characters
characters characters because people would know it was a bot
if it got too long now the bots got better so they massively increase the
amount of the bots uh and how much they can write remember
the cia announced seven years ago that they're going to start writing fake news
with bots type that in cia to use computers to write
articles and then it says it's a bot and you put in what the disinfo you want
and then it runs around saying it and then they point at the russians when
hillary and all the bots failed and got defeated by the american people
they point at russia and say oh that's where the bots came from when the whole
bot thing was a couple hundred thousand dollars we'll look it up during the
break um of twitter coming to them and saying
help us push you for election coverage advertising
all right we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen yeah we've got wired magazine
on screen as i told you stay with us these are the facts

you're listening to the alex jones show
waging war on corruption alex jones
should the top of the season so the facts are in
there's been so many news articles from hre media the last decade it makes my
head spin how the big tech companies the cia you
name it we're developing fake news bots to go out and propaganda dies
and shan parker came out last year and said that we're targeting helpless people
we're controlling them we're manipulating their dopamine levels
facebook documents came out in 2017 out of australia at the highest levels
about how they target liberals and try to keep them alone
and radicalized and scared their main target is
leftist that just translates into domesticated millennial with no future
and then the parasites that usually kind of beatnik types that feed on them and
control them you'll see it everywhere you go to a leftist rally none of them
will talk to anybody because they're not supposed to talk and none of them can
talk they'll be like one communist minder
they're usually driving a Mercedes so continuing
here the cia's fake news campaign even the new york times last year admitted
that uh and and the whole bots wired magazine said
what do bots mean to the future of journalism well
twitter is mainly leftist bots so is facebook and it's fake people advertising
things to you it's it's all of it and there
here's the key though it's fake bots bullying you
when you say something that's true or patriotic or pro america
just like veritas got the documents out of twitter
and the employees on video saying i'll give an example we banned sharing the
american flag and then you think you're sharing it but
you're not we don't like white people we don't like rednecks
now again it's mainly white people saying this just like
hbo and just like all the stuff that's happening
at these other platforms like vice billionaires
that run that channel want the public to see things like this
vice airs documentary on black healing retreats for people who need a break
from white people and we're going to place them that the third hour today
some excerpts it's amazing they say things in there
that are just dumbfounding like well whites are inherently evil white
shouldn't be able to travel outside the country
true true brainwashing so that's going to be coming up
as well so that's the point i'm trying to get at is
it's fake people you're talking to it is fake bots it is fake propaganda
and it is creating race war division culture war
men against women women against men families against families
america against russia but open the borders up to islam
and don't check anybody and let them come in unvetted and
find european countries a hundred thousand euros a year if they don't bring
in military aged men on and on and on and throw old
pensioners out of their sectionate housing and put islamists in it
because they've got to advertise and sweeten the deal
to get people to come there for the Balkanization of
europe that is the plan and as soon as people start realizing how diabolical
all this is and how this is planned and how this is admitted
the sooner we can beat it because you got fake bots trying to run your life
you've got fake bots bullying you you've got ai autonomous computers already
running your health care already running the va already
deciding who gets a knee surgery who doesn't
it's here and they cause a national debate because etna comes out and says
well humans don't review it it's machines
everybody freaks out that's the plan
we're under it oh now the national health service is falling apart in the u k
it's always been horrible but now there's a problem because they're about to make
it worse and put it under the big corporations to totally privatize it
but it's not going to be privatization like we think of it's going to be
privatization where computers run it all and screw everybody and only big
mega corporations get to be in the pool
that's the opposite of trump's free marketization where he's actually trying
to have an open bidding process which will drive down prices in
every single case but the more money you put behind education
the more money you put behind health care the more the price goes up and when
you make people buy health care like a national health
service everybody's got to pay into what should do it drives the price up
and when you make people buy obama care that doubles and triples prices with
grubber saying thank god you're so dumb i was hired to double and triple prices
thank god they have no memory they're like a goldfish
ha ha ha you're so effing stupid like zuckerberg said about you if you do go
along with that you are dumb aren't you
but people that don't have any friends that sit there in a little apartment
and are lucky if they have a job and are totally scared and watch
cobear all night and then they go out on the street
and and and none of them really talk to each other or friends they all just
virtue signal they're all really alone really
scared with the screen sickness they're all only looking at their phones when
you see trendies walking down the street they're alone
they're isolated
under the smart phone spell under the smart phone sickness
which they admit programs your brain lowers your iq lowers your brain waves
it's incredible
now i have so much news it makes my head spin but
coming up we're going to have a couple really interesting really smart guys in
studio really interesting backgrounds and i wish both of them would tell you
more of their background but they've seen quite a few things
and we're going to get their take on that they were here before about a
month ago about just a magazine ad that shows
antifa attacking and burning thing and an image of veterans
saying not on our watch not today antifa and since then newsweek time all
attacked the national news which only brought them more success and blew up
in their face but now the democrats are calling for all this violence
we're going to be discussing that coming up uh at the six afters when we're
going to bring those folks in i've got a special report that needs to be seen
social media giants meet for orwellian control
that's coming up the first five minutes of the next hour
and then we're going to uh the illusion of globalism is getting to fade
we must reclaim our republics some really powerful pieces but what's
sickening is steven bannon the videos up on info wars dot com
judas is scary it meets benedict arnold they had a baby
it'd be called stevy bannon little stevy weavy bannon
lemon squeezy bannon uh he has come out
and he has said oh the me too they always stage it like in private
meeting with a reporter he he clutched himself and said the women are going
enslave us they're too powerful they're too incredible
they'll bring down trump i'm scared they'll cut my testicles off i i don't
know what to do mommy mommy let's play that club again
and and and this is just meant to hype women into this oh you want power
oh look even the elites the bad guy that the evil man bannon is now a good guy
and he he admits he's scared of you women power against the men i mean this is
the most ridiculous sophomoric advertising like
edward bernay's saying we can't get women to smoke cigarettes in the 1920s
they said finance every feminist suffrage march and have the women smoke
cigarettes and say my man can't stop me well that was men owned the tobacco
companies no i was going to kill you deader than a hammer so it's the same
total manipulation uh so here's little stevie bannon
i don't normally play clubs twice an hour but here's here's one of the
reporters on cnn fawning over oh yeah so
how they built up the whole me too movement to create this
that the obvious direction to quote empower women
to hate trump and hate recovery and hate america
and then celebrate the north korean's dictator sister
who's so sexy and cool on the very same channel here it is
in the paperback release of the new book you talk about watching the golden
globe awards with steve bannon and you got his reaction to the red carpet
protest supporting the me too movement he said quote the antra anti patriarchy
is going to undo 10 000 years of recorded history you watch the time
has come women are going to take charge of society
and they couldn't juxtapose a better villain than trump he is the patriarch
this is a definitional moment in the culture it'll never be the same
going forward you know i think bannon despite all his
flaws is a pretty shrewd analyst of american politics and particularly
american political anxieties are national anxieties and he recognized
in those golden globe awards that this was a movement that could potentially
be an existential threat to republicans not just the majority in the house
but also to president trump and there's a wonderful revealing moment of fruity
and angst in the scene as i described bannon watching oprah
where he says look if they were to roll out a guillotine right now
these ladies would chop off every set of balls in the room
but which is which is a blunt bannon way of saying they're good and we're bad
me too movement they're coming for our manhood and i think that expressed
a lot of the anxieties that bannon that trump the people of that political
persuasion have about this this new rising movement of
of women which is really a backlash to the man that that bannon calls the
patriarch trump himself so this is trump's supposed best buddy
now saying he's the patriarchy he's evil he's got to be brought down
total bit of carnal behavior with this whole made-up narrative that women are
going to be empowered if trump was taken down and this is how you're
powerful ladies when seeing in funded the whole arab spring was part of it
promoted it turning most of middle east over to
total killers that enslaved hundreds of thousands of women killed tens of
thousands sold children to sex slavery cover up for radical islam
and they're just up there saying women you're supposed to get mad at trump now
and go do something and this is how you're empowered and everyone's scared of
you because you're so powerful when all of this is multinational
corporations trying to kill an american recovery and an american move to get
control over our government again from the globalist this is the second
american revolution the left admits that those videos are coming up rob
reiner and others they say we're in a revolution
they say they're gonna stop america's recovery that video is coming up spread

you're listening to the alex jones show
alex jones here back live coming up what news writing bots me for the future
of journalism and the media admits that zuckerberg
and facebook is starting to collapse that their whole operation is in flames
first this powerful report social media giants me for orwellian control
representatives from google facebook twitter and youtube
faced the british parliamentary committee on us soil at george
washington university they were reminded of their own
unchecked power to gather their users data there's an ask in the times today
in the uk and the headline is how to win two billion friends and destroy
civilization the biggest surveillance enterprise
in history and this is by a very well-known journalist
and he is is suggesting that there's whether facebook like it or not the
position that you've got yourself into is this
disposition it is it you hold so much data about people that you are now
very very powerful i just wanted to know how long
do you um do you hold people's data for that you collect about them
do you limit yes as long as they want us to oddly enough
after demonizing the social media giants reach the orwellian panel dove head
first into the need to control and regulate free
speech to accept them that there is a problem of
bogus news misleading news disinformation and you also accept that you
have both the responsibility to and the means to address that
we recognize that there is a problem of misinformation and we are dedicated to
making sure that we are um promoting authoritative
content when it comes to news and demoting misinformation when you're
talking about misinformation well let's face it misinformation
disinformation fake news uh can be sort of sexy i mean people like
ghosts they like conspiracy theories they like ufo stories and they follow it
and this creates i would imagine a huge amount of traffic
both propagating those theories etc and those who want to quash that so that
would be good for you because you can then harvest the data from those people
uh who we who are doing that doesn't it demonstrate that perhaps
it's time for regulation it's time for rules that set out the roles of
responsibilities and all of these things because all of this is affecting
our society we are not the arbiters of truth
we are not going to remove content based on that this is untrue and
the one trend that twitter has is it's a hive of journalists of citizens of
activists correcting the record and correcting information
if an account was created for the sole purpose of abusing somebody that would
cross our sole purpose abuse if it was using uh language based on a
protective characteristic and it's hateful conduct we'd move it for that
but the the truestness of a piece of information is not the ground upon
the deliberate use of your platform to distribute
absolutely false and inflammatory information uh can continue in election
time according to what you've just said do you agree with me that twitter is
addictive but i don't think it's uh in in our position to say that because it
depends very much on the individual i think it's exactly your position to
say that because it is your product we have a large
team of what we call raiders uh 10 000 people around the globe who are
constantly at work assessing our results against different
queries uh are we surfacing the right kind of
results are we surfacing results that have appropriate authority
and they we use that those hundreds of thousands of bits of data
from those evaluations to continue to train our systems
this is an ongoing effort i just wanted to mention some
research that was done recently by The Guardian that suggested that
the largest source of news uh for false uh news channels came from youtube and
came from these videos that tend to be recommended by the
next button and more research by Oxford academics demonstrated
a lot of this had a far right bias so i put it to you that if that is the case
uh you are indoctrinating society ultimately regulating social media
information will ensure its own downfall credible sources
truth and valid opinions are not exclusive to the establishment media in
fact the opposite has become increasingly
and overwhelmingly true john bound reporting for info wars dot com
you know i've got some talking points here about caveman from info wars
live dot com but instead of going on those talking
points let me just give you what i've experienced personally
from all the lives tales in every culture we know that the bones have the
essence we know chicken noodle soup it's great for people that are sick
again in every culture this has been reported because it works
and there's no way to quantify how strong this is but the amount of bone
protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of
concentrated life force that is in this is
incredible ladies and gentlemen whether it's for your joints
whether it's for your arteries and your veins whether it's for your brain
whether it's for energy this ladies and gentlemen
is the strongest most concentrated bone broth formula out there
and it's amazing find out for yourself today at info wars store dot com

support you are funding the information war in 2018
Well, the kingpin of Hollywood, Rob Reiner says the left is in a revolution against America,
against Trump, and they're calling for more violence. Here's a little compilation of
some of what they've been saying lately.
Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody
decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the secret service.
All right, there's so much to cover on this front that if I start talking, these guys
will never get a word in edgewise. And some of these folks, we just flew back into Austin,
so I want to get to their views of what's happening currently with Kit Cope of Spicetatical.com
and of course, Lincoln Osiris, which is a joke name, a gnome deplume from Tropic Thunder.
And we're going to get these guys to hold backgrounds or anything, but they're really
interesting fellows. And of course, my good buddy over here, Quentin Carter. But we do
have the Democrats calling for civil war, calling for killing people, attacking people
all over the country. You guys a few months ago did a full page spread, photos saying
none on our watch, not today, Antifa. The media went crazy. I wanted to get you guys
back to talk about just how you see with your backgrounds, being in the third world, being
in dictatorships, also, you know, knowing things about different aspects of COG without
getting classified where this country is because the Democrats put out that we're in a war.
They're attacking us. They want to overthrow things in their own venues at their own award
shows at the New York Times. But then when we cover it, they say, you're insane. None
of that's happening. What is that military tactic? So again, Kit Q. And of course, we've
got Mr. Mr. Lincoln Osiris over here who wants to take it first.
I think that's I think that's you, Lincoln. You've got the you've got the most. You have
the most experience with that sort of bottom line. I figured he did. He definitely does.
But bottom line is the insanity that that people will blindly follow an ideology that
they have no idea what it is. So the Democrats are out there calling for civil war, knowing
that they're not the ones on the line. They're trying to manipulate ignorant people to go
out and fight that war for them. So the whether it's the people in Charlottesville or anywhere
else that come out and they write and they do all this stuff, they're not doing it because
they think that's the right thing to do. They're doing it because they've been manipulated
by someone who has a different idea of what it is that they're doing.
Well, by sensationalism and emotion as well. Just like George Soros and them pushing the
Black Lives Matter movement. They know that that black on black violence kills black people.
It never affects the ultra rich white globalist. It only helps them. That's right. And to
be honest, some of these guys actually may believe that they're doing right. But that
just kind of really helps explain the difference between our mindset and their mindset. I'm
just concerned because there's a massive gear up and George Soros is in the news. Everyone
are funding it and people say, Oh, well, they're a joke. I get they're a joke. Like you said
to you, they're just the cover for this. But the Democrats aren't giving up and going along
with the election and the recovery. They're fighting. Here's a great example. They cheered
the North Korean dictator's sister at the opening of the Olympics and said in the news,
we hope she kicks the vice president off the podium. They then said, Oh, Trump was a military
parade. That's fascist. We're going to lay in front of the tanks when a parade isn't tanks
coming into the capital city of China to crush peaceful demonstrators like Tiananmen Square.
The left are the ones trying to block free speech everywhere. They're the tanks.
Absolutely. Absolutely. And you know what's so strange? I just did an interview the other
day regarding the very same advert that's behind us right now. And the guy that was
doing the interview, he said to me, he said, Oh, well, you know, I'm fairly left leaning.
You know, I'm not, you know, I'm not in the socialist party like a lot of my friends.
And I said, wait, right there. Stop. You just said a lot of your friends are in the socialist
party. Now, when I was growing up, that was a really bad word. That meant like impending
doom. Oh, no, they're socialists. There's people here that are whole show that half
of millennials, half of millennials identify as socialist or communist. Amazing. No one
I mean, I think part of that is because they've grown up in a society where the last eight
12 years, everything was given to them. So they think that's the norm. Like everything
should be given to me. I deserve free college. I deserve this. I deserve that. I don't have
to work for anything. I don't have to do anything. There's there's no military obligation. Like
I don't have to go somewhere. Lincoln and myself both have free college. That's what
they say. Well, it's not free at all because we both spend lots of money for many, many
years earning it. So let me ask this question to Lincoln. Looking at this, looking at the
battle space in America, if you're just a citizen, where do you think the country is
right now? What do you think Trump is with the recovery? Are we turning the tide? Are
we winning or I mean, what do you expect to happen because the left has just gone into
a total craze mode and I'm really concerned. So we spoke about this last time I was on
the air. They don't have anything else. I think at this point they've got to resort
to this is the last resort. We our stock markets are looking great. The economy is turning
around. We're at the lowest point of unemployment for blacks in history. And what do they have?
They've got nothing but let's just create violence. If and I don't believe they say
they're for free speech unless it's in opposition to what they're saying. So I think this is
all they've got left. They're just trying to create drama. But what I don't understand
is why. Like I really cannot fathom at all. Like what's the whole idea? All about controlling
us. They want power over America to control the planet. It just blows my mind. I just
can't see it. I don't understand how it works. They can't afford to have anyone look at our
administration and think things are going well, that he's doing a good job. They cannot
afford that. Therefore they've got to take the truth and twist it. But in your mind,
where do you think that you stand to gain something by bringing us down? You're an American.
You're one of us. You should be sitting here. Well, that's the thing. They openly root for
the North Korean dictator. Right. And that's what I'm saying. I need maybe some psychological
expertise to tell me like why this is okay. And why are there so many young white male
kids out there wearing skinny jeans and beanies right now talking about communism and all
of this other crap that they have no idea what it is. We messed up. This is what we
should do. This is the result of the participation trophy. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. This is what happens
when everybody gets a ribbon. Exactly. That's what Matt and Zach, some of the producers
say is that it's a live action role playing when they go out with guns and block people
from going to rallies and attack people or hit a woman there with a bike lock. For them,
it's like larping. It's not real. Right. Because there's never been a repercussion
for their actions because they grew up in a household where daddy didn't whip them and
mom was like, Oh, don't be mean to him. Let's be really soft about his feelings and don't
yell at him, but give him his phone and his computer and his car back and let him go do
whatever instead of taking a whooping like we did as kids. If you messed up, Dr. Jones
will war you out if you acted the way that these kids act today. But that's from that.
That's from the street level, uh, from the upper echelon, from the level controlling
that level. You know, obviously you've, you've got your, your theories on, on why and how,
but from the, from that street level where, where all these kids are just, you know, gimme,
gimme, gimme, and I don't have to pay for what I've done or anything. The, the blind
following is, is really what's confusing. Exactly. They're never running to Venezuela
or Cuba or North Korea anywhere. They're just here bitching with their smartphones and
their new car and like, I want communism bitches. And they're like, you're like, are you kidding
in communism? You wouldn't have anything. We'll be back to talk about then what their
next move will be as they lose and there's a global awakening.

We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com
studios. We are back live. We've got big news coming up next segment, but the biggest news
is right now with KitCup of Spicestatical.com. We've got Lincoln Osiris of PipeHitersUnion.com,
some of the greatest t-shirts and other materials out there. But before I go any further, we're
talking during the break, we have all these COG groups, the Democratic Party, in Atlantic
Monthly, you name it, saying we're already shopping around the Pentagon overthrowing
the president extrajudicially. You have Brennan, you have Clapper last year saying he'll be
gone by December in October. That didn't happen. You've got Phil Mudd, the former head of counter
terrorism at the CIA, who says he's a proud crap holder. That's a quote, two of you haven't
seen it, saying the government's going to kill this guy about the president. My concern,
just to you guys as citizens, veterans, as patriots, what happens if the president is
killed? What happens if all the left's threats to do this and try to overthrow the election
and all of this? What happens in your mind if that unfolds?
I would imagine, I mean, I would imagine in the interim, right after the overthrow, there
are, you got to think of, okay, well, who's in charge? Who's controlling what's going
to happen next? So you would think, okay, it's just a police state. Well, then who
runs that?
Right. And then you start thinking of police state. You start thinking about things like
that. You start talking about big government being shut down, the welfare system, free
food, free water, free groceries, all that kind of stuff. What's going to happen in the
inner cities? We saw it, what, two years ago when California turned off EBT for 12 hours
and they started trying to burn the place down. But what happens when that system shuts
down completely? And my big thing is, is what happens amongst veterans and patriots when
something happens for whatever reason, whether he's removed or killed or whatever. And now
someone else decides they're just going to come into our place and take what's ours and
change that. How far is the normal person going to be pushed before they decide, okay,
my back's against the ropes and I'm coming out swinging.
And will it even get that far? The reason I say that is, all right, you take over the
government. How do you hold it? Yeah, yeah, that's what I can't imagine. Even for even
a minute, most units, most military units, of course, they're going to have to implement
martial law. But most units are saying, Hey, I'm not down with this. I've got a family
at home. I'm going to go take care of my family because when the world's on fire, guys are
thinking about home, they're thinking about their families. They're not thinking about,
Hey, this unlawful order that was just given to me. Yeah, so it's one thing to, you know,
kill the president. But now you've got control. How do you hold it? Yeah, I don't think it
recovers almost impossible. We've had this conversation is that aren't going to lay down.
Right. We've had this conversation in many different countries in the middle of the
night, random, you know, conversations between guys who do the things that we do. You know,
if it came down to it, could you fire on Americans? You know, if you were put in a position for
martial law, for the National Guard, for whatever is, what's the reality that federal troops
or state troops will patrol the streets and fire on Americans? And it's just not going
to happen. I don't believe it at all. I'll tell you what, I've done a whole lot of horrible
things in the name of the country. But that is one thing I couldn't do. No, and that's
why I'm not that guy. And that's why I think it doesn't recover. I don't think the system
recovers at all. I don't think you can overthrow the president, take over the system and establish
your own regime. I don't think so. I think you, you start that process. Everything's
going to turn to, I can't curse. Crap. Bravo, Sierra. Yep. There we go. And, and we've got
a, we've got a feudal system. You guys got in like 10 minutes before you went on air.
We haven't even talked for a long time there. I asked that question because that's the common
sense answer. I figured I'd get, because I get that from other veterans and active duty.
You name it. And the only reason we're raising this is mainstream media is pushing the narrative.
This is coming. Probably overthrown. He's a Russian agent. Rand Paul's a Russian agent.
Tucker Carlson's a Russian agent. Roger Stone's a Russian agent with no proof. And then they're
the outside globalist power trying to sell us. It's just what you just said. Kit and
what Lincoln said and what Q said. No one's going to go along with that. And that shows
the bravada and the insane disconnect of all these senile people and really crazy people
like Michael Moore who says, we want martial law, arrest, you know, Trump, you know, bring
in all this stuff. It's like they're the ones pushing this. And I don't think they'll ever
get away with it. I'm just surprised how tolerant it's been so far when they're in the news
saying we're going to kill everybody. We're going to overthrow. We're planning to kill
the president. We're planning to do all this stuff. We're going after his family. And then
we're all sitting here taking it. I just, I mean, there should be grand juries convened.
The FBI should be visiting people. If I was on air saying let's organize people for violence
to start killing people over to the government. I mean, I should be visited, but, but, but
no, they're all doing it. And it's fine. Yeah, they can go about their normal day. They go
to work. They go home. They live their lives and they should be hemmed up. And those are
the ones that will fall in line. March step to the beat of the drum. Those guys will fall
in line. I think they want to be told what to do. Michael Moore and those guys, they
don't think about something that because they don't live in a reality we live in. Martial
law means civil unrest. It means killing and all kinds of crazy stuff. It means that there
are people at home that don't have anything that they're going to go find it from somewhere
else, right? I've got some food. I've got some water and the leftist elites with their
10 foot walls out in California. Boy, guess what? Um, if, if hypothetically, if, if I
needed something and I needed to go find it, I'm not going to go to an urban area of Atlanta
to find what it is that I'm looking for. I'm going to go to some big fancy house in the
hills with a 10 foot fence because they have everything they've ever wanted and ever needed.
And that's where I'm going to resupply myself. So when you start calling for this war, um,
I think you're, you're not fully thinking that, you know, someone's going to come take
what belongs to you because there are people out there with skills and tools and a need.
If I need to feed my family, if I need to get something to take care of them, I'll stop
at no means to get what it is they need.
Well, take, take Bet Midler. We're going to go to break here in a few minutes. She came
out when Rand Paul voted against the budget, which was, you know, a reasonable thing. I
get why Trump had to do it. So to stall the economy, but, but, but, but Bet Midler came
out and said, Oh, I wish his neighbor would have finished the job basically, you know,
attacking him, not even knowing that Rand Paul was an opposition to Trump. They're so
politically ignorant. They don't even know who the players are.
Well, it's all the projection as well. Uh, like, like we talked about last time, you
see the Antifa guys out there. Uh, they, there's actually signs that say that their, their
rally is supported by the Communist Party. And then it says on their website. Yeah.
And then you've got, and then you've got them calling the right communists. It's just projection.
It's, it's just, look, this is what we are. We know it's bad. We're going to tell them
that that's what you are. And something to think about too, like the, what's being shown
right there on the screen right now is those guys are role-playing. They're, they're not
being serious. They don't feel that's not in their heart. They're just out there playing
a game. They left their mom's basement. He grabbed some AR. It may be even some airsoft
guy. They're not ready to kill or take the consequences of being killed whatsoever. Do
they have any skill set or any idea of what it takes to, to pull that trigger? And they've
got a very false sense of confidence. These guys have played too many video games. You
know, they think, you know what's up. And it's like that famous quote, everybody's got
a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, that's exactly what's happening here.
They're walking tall, looking strong, but the moment things pop off, they've got no idea
what they're doing.
Henry Rollins said it, right? It's easy to hold a hammer. Do you have what it takes
to hit the nail? That's it.
All right. We'll be back to talk about some incredible breaking news on the other side.
It's a no-brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period. You need a water
filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides,

Well we got some great guys in here with us. Kit Kulp of spikestatical.com, Lincoln Osiris
which is a joke name. Who by the way make t-shirts here in America for us at less of
a price that are higher quality than we had before. So we really appreciate him right
here in Austin, Texas. I'll leave it at that.
I know you guys don't want to talk about yourselves. You said don't even get into my bio, but obviously
a lot of your bios are secret and stuff, but take Kit, you're a MMA title contender, world
champion, Muay Thai, fighting for major countries, winning on and on and on, combat veteran, whole
bunch of different secretive groups we can get into. Lincoln Osiris, I mean, wow, guys
like this talked. What type of books could they write? He hasn't even told me any of
the stuff he's involved or anything. He just comes on the show and gets the system watching
what we're doing. It's just crazy to then see you guys committed to the country, proving
what you stand for versus the Democrats. And I'm in here during the break going, you didn't
see Phil Mudd on TV say we're going to kill the president. You didn't see Clapper and
Brennan right after they were kicked out. Middle of last year, say he'll be gone by
December extrajudicially. It won't be an impeachment. We're going to take him out. They're the stories
right there. Why aren't we seeing that daily? It's only on CNN. That's what I'm saying.
On their echo boxes, they're saying we're going to kill the president. And I was told
by sources, they said, Alex, they're stay behind networks are so scared in the Justice
Department FBI committing these crimes. They're surrounded by good agents. They have to say
this to look like they're still winning. Then Mudd came out last week and said, we're winning.
Stay there. Stay at your post. We're winning. So I guess that's true. It's like desperation
is why they're saying this, but I don't want to be too arrogant because if somebody's desperate,
sometimes they can cause some damage.
They're right. That makes sense into the corner thing. Absolutely makes sense. Dealing with
a problem like that right now. And just so that we're not very, very dangerous individual.
Just so that we're not CNN and we don't put on any fake news. Yeah, there's a great
bit of our combat veteran. It is a contractor has worked around the world done security.
Yeah, but I just, there's somebody out there right now that's going, kid, it's not a combat
veteran. If a war is lying in there, whatever, like, no, fake news, simply misspoke. He is
a contractor. He's done security high threat around the world. But I can't keep track of
that. We know, we know, you know, which, which is actually, you know, let's you guys know
out there that you can get all of that training just like these guys, you know, get all that
training that all the tactical training and still do the work. Absolutely. Or your country
and they can end up, you know, helping the folks over at the gun operation you're involved
in. I do, I do that as well. That's like tactical. I want to get into that here in just a moment,
but I don't want to sit here and rant. And then, and then you guys don't have time. What
is on your mind about the country right now? Cause all I know is the left's running around
saying they're going to kill everybody. They're going to overthrow everything. They're going
to burn everything down. They're going to open up the president. I mean, I guess Lincoln,
you could see the articles when I was calling for them on screen, the videos of them saying
what I was saying. I know that sounds unbelievable. If true, the things I said, what do you make
of those? It is very unbelievable. It is, I can't imagine that every media outlet on
the planet isn't having this discussion right now. It is, it's unfathomable that someone
would actually come out and say, Hey, we're going to kill the president. It is. And it's,
I think it's a call not only on their side, but ours. It's a call to action. Let's be real
by no means in my advocating violence. I'm not saying go out there and burn stuff down
and do whatever, but I am saying that they're calling for an end to our reality. The way
that we live, our democracy, our justice system, all these different things, they're calling
for an end to that. They want a war and it's time for you to be prepared, whatever that
means. If that means that you need to stock up on some stuff or that's what I'm saying
exactly right now. I've never seen the left worldwide as wound up and out of control as
they are. And they say they're in this existential death battle and that they're not giving up,
but it actually, it actually appears as though they are moving forward with an agenda. They
are actually trying to execute plans now. I've never before felt that we were on the
verge of civil war like I do now. And that's a very scary feeling to step back. I've been
to civil wars. I have seen the death and destruction in mayhem. It is very, very hard to believe
that that, that we're so close to that here in the now neighbor versus neighbor. Right.
Yeah, it's scary. Which clip do we have ready? You guys have Phil Mudd saying the government's
going to kill this guy or do you have Rob Reiner ready? Pardon me? Phil Mudd. Yeah, let's play
Phil Mudd. He's made a bunch of these statements, but here's one of them. What was your response,
Phil Mudd? A couple of surprises. Let me give you one bottom line as former government official.
Government's going to kill this guy. He defends Vladimir Putin. Their State Department and
CIA offers are coming home. And at Langley and at Foggy Bottom, CIA and State, they're
saying this is how you defend us. And Phil, before... Oh, that's good. And then we've got
Rob Reiner just last Friday saying all these lies and then saying we're on a glide path
to take over America. But the president's here. So we're in the last battle of the civil war.
Here's that clip of Rob Reiner. Then he gets into office and there are good people on both sides
in Charlottesville. And there are people coming from f***ing countries. And it goes on and on.
And you see the people that he hires that are in his administration. And we see
that this now becomes the last battle of the civil war. And we're fighting it right now.
And we're going to win. We're going to win. But we thought we were on this glide path. We've been
dragged back and we're going to win because if we don't win, the promise of what this country
started as, which is we are all one, we are all created equal, that promise will not be realized
unless we can overcome what has happened in this last election. And I know we will.
I have so much to say. Like, I don't even know where to start.
Like, what is he talking about? Backsliding and all of this craziness and...
They're the ones who want to destroy the country.
Right. What's backsliding? The economy, jobs? They're trying to backslide it.
All of these things are doing great. Lincoln, you can hear us talking about it.
What do you make of Hollywood saying that we're in a civil war?
Well, it's quite interesting. Hollywood, those guys are literally living in a fantasy land.
It's your job to pretend.
What is their job in a fantasy land? But their reality is also a fantasy land.
These individuals that are calling for a civil war and martial law and to take out the president,
they've got no idea what that would mean. What would follow? They're not prepared for it.
They've got no idea what it would bring. There would be the first people to like...
Everywhere left to take over, everything collapses. Why do they want to do it then?
It reminds me of the... Who was it? Tom Cruise thing where he said that
that his job is just as hard as like a recon marine or something like that.
Because he's been through all of the same training that they have and that kind of thing.
They're not living in reality at all.
If Rob Ryan wants to see civil war, he needs to jump on an airplane and take his self to Africa.
Go watch where people mutilate other people simply because they're from a different tribe,
where men, women and children are killed and burned and hacked into pieces.
He doesn't know what reality of civil war is.
That's a word he's using based upon something he read in some liberal year book 20 years ago.
And he doesn't like that far. Jump on a plane down to Caracas, my friend.
There you go. There you go. Good luck with that.
It's just... It's emotional, fear mongering and sensationalism.
And that's my point is they're trying to start this war and if they do, they're completely out of luck.
When we come back, we're going to talk about Pie Pitter's Union.

and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
All right, we're back live. Roger Stone's coming up about 15 minutes in the next hour in studio
with me, but I'm here talking to my buddies, Spikes Tactical and Piper's Union, also Quentin,
the DC Mall cop. I'm a combat veteran of the DC Mall.
I moved up. It was Atlanta. Now I'm in DC.
You're in the DC now. It's even rougher. Hey, seriously though, Vanessa Trump taking a hospital,
NBC reports, as precaution efforts, suspicious letters, sent her home and the anthrax they think
or something, and so she's been sent to the hospital. The amount of threats that family gets.
It's not about kissing Trump's ass, but he really has stood up to a lot of bullying,
delivered on so many fronts. It's crazy. I want to get into Spikes Tactical, Piper's Union,
all of this, but any other comments that you guys want to make during the breaks?
In the past eight years, how many times did we hear anything about a personal attack on Obama
or his family? Yeah, didn't happen. Never heard one. Did you never heard anything about his kids
being threatened or his family being threatened? Or conservatives beating liberals up? Or chasing
somebody down and beating them up? What happened to the inauguration trying to get in?
Multiple things. I mean, how many times did we get in in fistfights, literal fistfights,
just trying to get in the building? I mean, just getting in the mall. Yeah. Just to get in there.
Like, it was insane. But we never saw any of that. So, that's just proof that they'll stop at no
means to disrupt our normal standard behavior by me cost. That's all I'm saying. It's not like I'm
saying they're badass and scary and they're like Godzilla coming out of the ocean. They're just out
of control. But they want to make us the conservative gun owner threat. They want to say we are the
bad guys, but we're not the ones out there creating havoc and hurting people in public and, you know,
beating up old ladies with bike locks and chains and pipes. So, we took a call. This is the level
of intellect that we're dealing with. We took a call the other day at Spike's Tactical. We've
gotten a lot of calls since our ad. And the guy in the same sentence, or not in the same,
in the same phrase, said, Bible thumping, Bible thumping, gun toting, Nazis, two sentences later,
you Jew loving something. Fascist. Fascist. Yeah. That's right. Like, that's what I've noticed is
the anti-Jew folks are now anti-Nazi too. None of them make sense. It's like, if we just throw
enough spaghetti against the wall, something's going to stay. So, I'm just going to call you every
name that I can think of. Everything. That's like that gun shop in Washington where the guy walks in
and goes, you sell the, and uses the K word. Right. And the guy goes, yeah, we sell their
buddy. And then the guy just flips out, well, let's talk about this. There's a way to support
the broadcast. Plus, it's a way to get high quality products. Let's talk about Spike's Tactical.
And the fact you guys are sponsors, which is great for a major gun group, but all the accessories
you've got and the courage to promote Americana when, you know, people target folks that tell
the truth, but you guys already flew your flag with the full page ads you've been running.
That's what you're all about. Tell us about Spike's Tactical and why it's so important.
5% off is already discounted folks. When you go there and use promo code, Alex,
at spikes tactical.com. Tell us about that kit. Well, we, in actually, Spike's Tactical started
September 10th, 2001, the day before the big event. And Spike himself just sought to
make the absolute best rifle out there that people could afford. And so that's what we've
done. Everything, everything has a full lifetime guarantee, a no BS lifetime guarantee. And that's
why Pipehitter's Union has actually started doing a collaboration with us as well. Lincoln,
Lincoln, why was it that you picked? Well, a couple of years ago, we decided to,
we wanted to put out a line of rifles. We wanted rifles that were high quality,
that were combat rated, if you will, that we could like put our name on and really stand
behind. So we looked around at quite a few companies. And to be quite honest, it was an easy
decision to make. Spikes tactical is a small family owned business, not super small. They're not
run out of a garage by any means, but they are not one of the giants in the industry. They stand
behind their products. As Kit said, it's a no BS lifetime guarantee. If you have a problem with
your gun, they will fix the problem. And that is huge in today's age that is not happening with any
other small for the lifetime of the gun, whether you bought it from us originally or bought it
off the internet or bought it, you know, found it in a trash can. It's a spikes rifle and we'll
take care of it. We decided to sit down with them. We built an entire line of guns. They're
extremely high quality. We put the money where it really mattered. You're looking for the pipe
hitters rifles anyway, you're looking at a high end barrel, a high end bolt, a high end trigger,
everything that really important. Now we saved money by, you know, using forward jumpers and
lowers for our basic line and threw on some cool stuff to make it, you know, to give it a good
appearance. So you've got a very high end rifle at a very affordable price. You can't go wrong.
That's, I mean, we are family. As you can see by, you know, the ad that we ran with spikes tactical,
we are family with them. And I can't imagine using any other rifle. Well, I know the listeners
are big fans already of spike tactical and the fact you're supporting us. You're getting your
second member, you're getting high quality rifles and accessories and you're funding the info or a
total win. That's a yep. That's a double W. Right. So we're saying, you know, for info wars listeners,
go to spikes tactical.com, pick out anything, pick out a t-shirt, gun parts, full receivers,
whatever it is that you're looking for, anything that's there or even call the number that's
associated. There's a 1-800 number on the website. You can call and order those things,
give them the promo code, Alex, get a discount. And that is for any product. You want stickers or
a full rifle for anything. Before I even worked for spikes tactical, the reason that I was drawn
to it to the company is when I was first getting into AR's, somebody told me, okay, well, when
you buy an AR, you're going to need to upgrade your bolt carrier group, upgrade your trigger,
and make sure that you've got a really nice barrel. Those are the most important things on your rifle to,
you know, once you get a bare bones rifle. Well, when I saw spikes tactical rifles and I said,
oh, well, that stuff already comes upgraded. That stuff's already the highest end stuff that you
can get on our basic rifles. And just so you know, there are a million rifle companies out there.
And some of them are good. The large majority of them are not so good. And in the rifle business,
you tend to get what you pay for. So you've really got to pay attention. You can go down to one of
these big box stores and find a rifle for 600 bucks. And you're lucky if that thing's going to last
you a year. So the quality that you get at spikes tactical is top notch. The service that you're
going to get is top notch. You couldn't ask for anything more than what you're going to get at
spikes tactical. Plus, we're not funded by George Soros or the globalist. So that's what I'm looking
for is the very best companies that have a great quality product with all the accessories, t shirts,
you know, you name it from the full rifles down to all the accessories. We're also 100% American
made everything on the right. I should have added that up front. Because I've got the whole deal here.
I was going to say that it's 100% American made. They are strong supporters of the Second Amendment.
They are strong supporters of the military. Spike gives back a lot. Well, most big companies,
even small ones are intimidated because they oh my God, Alex Jones, he's too radical. So the fact
is you guys are a top tier gun company, great prices, and you support the info war. It's a win-win
for our audience. So we have the partnership between Patriots, Info Wars, and Spice Tactical.
It's 100% American made rifle company builds high quality rifles for the best price possible.
Their rifles or AR configurations have an actual aerospace engineer behind the R&D.
They also feature an OBS lifetime warranty to guarantee your best rifle you can buy.
They're an industry innovation leader bringing you the largest selection of AR configurations
on the internet. Not only do you get the highest quality rifles from a team of true Patriots,
you can save 5% off their incredible products with promo code Alex at checkout. Save big at
SpiceTactical.com today. That's promo code Alex at SpiceTactical.com. And Spike does a lot of
things for a lot of people and he keeps it super quiet. He doesn't allow anyone to talk about
the things that he does as far as charity and benefit and stuff like that. He gives a ton of
money. I'm from Florida. I've known them for many years. I've been associated with them.
They do a lot for the community. But one of his caveats is don't tell anybody. I'm not doing
this because I don't want anyone to know. I'm doing this because it's what needs to be done.
There is a law enforcement unit that ran out of ammunition for training for a full year.
I shouldn't be saying this, but I'm going through anyway. Spike bought their full year of ammo
so that their law and training could train. But he didn't want anybody to know.
But there's a paradox there. If people don't talk about what they're doing and obsess on not doing
it, then nobody knows what's going on. So there's kind of that line of people have to talk about
some stuff or nobody knows what's going on. Right. So it's a tough line to ride. Trust me.
Beating your chest and saying, Hey, look at me. I do all this good stuff for everybody all the time
when really maybe you do. Maybe you don't. And doing a lot of good stuff for people and not
telling anyone. So that's why if Spike's Maddie can call me, but that's why I'm here. That's
why I'm here in this chair. We're going to come back to a few more minutes and then Roger Stone's
coming here to take over. I'm going to let Roger sit here and take over the whole transmission
today. He's got a bunch of special guests joining him as well. All right. We got the third hour

worldwide you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
technocracy takeover you're listening to alex jones
the
globalism is beginning to fade and once you've taken your blinders off or you could reverse that
and said taking the sunglasses uh uh that the establishment doesn't want you to wear and put
them on like they live you then see for yourself that you've been lied to over and over again by
so-called mainstream media that's simply bought and paid for by multinational interests that have
conquered this country and it doesn't mean that when you support info wars or president trump or
nationalism or pre-market capitalism that you think you're perfect or you think we're perfect
but we know it works a thousand times better and is what builds big open free wealthy societies
now that creates the byproduct of decadence so that's certainly a real issue but globalists
like george soros that have been openly bragging that they are funding trying to keep the uh EU
in control of countries that never voted to enter it like the uk the fact that he's so brazen and so
out in the open only will accelerate the planetary awakening of their tyranny with another 280
north koreans crossing the border soon all eyes will be on one member of the delegation kim jong
un's sister kim yo jong will become the first member of the kim ruling family to set foot in
the country it's the sister of kim jong un the bloodthirsty dictator who's constantly threatening
a nuke the us and all this and so they're there as part of a quote peace delegation because trumps
put pressure on them for the first time ever a member of the ruling communist royal house
communism's always royal it's no form of royalty it's the first time they come to the table because
they understand the trouble they're in nbc abc cbs is seeing in all praised her and said she was
glaring at pence and and liberals said oh we hope she attacks pence and oh she's so sexy oh she's so
beautiful and then when it blew up in their face they began to remove the video look at this kim
jong un's sister stealing the show at the winter olympics oh oh my gosh they keep more than half
their population in slave camps and they admit that they quote take babies like you take a chicken's
eggs at birth so they're not loyal to the family millions die every couple years uh they torture
people to death like no one's ever seen in our media i remember blaster hole kid we traveled
about four hours east of pyongyang to visit a ski resort that has significance in the recent talks
we've been watching between the north and south over the winter olympics this we're told is a place
where athletes from the north and south will be training together we were also invited here i would
suspect because it is not what people expect to see in north korea a modern ski resort
it's got patriotic music and videos playing from the screen here and a lot of families out enjoying
themselves we've spoken to some of those families people expressing a sense of optimism that the
two countries are speaking together a sense of pride that they will be competing together in the
winter olympics and also some expressing a sense of greater security given a chance to ratchet down
some of the tensions now you could not support a worse regime living on the planet stalin and hitler
were as bad or worse per capita even kill more people but but probably not even as psychotically
ridiculous i mean the north koreans are are are under total slavery if you are receiving this
transmission you are the resistance welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host roger stone
and it's great to be back in the mother ship i had a whirlwind tour of the united kingdom
spoke to the oxford union the cambridge union the uh the durham union society student organizations
and i found a real hunger among the people of the uk to get the truth because they're not
getting it from the bbc or from the guardian they make cnn and the new york times look honest
they're so out of whack donald trump is uh weakening our uh law enforcement agencies our
intelligence agencies uh it is it's the normal pap that is spit out inside the beltway and in the
media centers in washington but ten times worse and then i had a terrific tour of florida tallahassee
or lando bonita springs and naples and i must tell you the vibrance of the trump movement
it is stronger and more intense than ever the support for the president now that he has
pulled off a modern economic miracle we had eight years of anemic growth under barack obama
uh and the president has created two million new jobs uh he has uh he has cut regulations to
the bone his historic tax cuts have not even had an opportunity to get traction uh to yet
have the impact that's going to turbocharge this economy and already the generic ballot
for democrats in the upcoming congressional races which was somewhere a gap of around
17 18 weeks ago has now dropped to just six now the key thing here is that the
hand wringing by the country club republicans who are afraid we're going to lose the house in
2018 uh they really misunderstand what's going on the democrats have have demonstrated that they
have no program they hate donald trump we know that they want to impeach him we know that too
but they have no constructive program for america they're not running on anything they can't even
tell you what they're for so i believe if the republicans under the leadership of donald trump
run for jobs in prosperity and to reasserting america's role around the world the democrats
run on we hate donald trump uh we will we will hold our own in what is historically the party in
power always loses a few seats the real problem of course is if country club republicans if
establishment republicans cut and run if they abandon this president they do so at their own
peril that in my opinion will be folly stick with the president and we will do fine in the next
elections the the the sunshine soldiers that naysayers in the republican establishment
are panicking much too early as someone who's been in american politics for 40 years you can't
predict what's going to happen this november you can't say in february what the november elections
will be like the economy is likely to be uh greatly improved and it's already pretty strong and
making real progress in terms of undoing the damage of eight years of barack obama so uh
uh the other interesting piece of news here today is the unveiling of the portrait by
keyhand wiley the uh artist who appointed uh who painted the portrait of barack obama
incredibly this artist brags about mixing his own semen in with his paint as some kind of a
statement it's disgusting uh and this this photo looks like something out of the talking heads
it's very strange uh the other thing that i want to touch on today is a note of sadness
jeffrey bell who was a conservative activist an aide to governor ronald reagan in 1976
a a seminal issue advisor for ronald reagan in 1980 a man who was a real pioneer of the supply side
economics movement an advisor to jack kemp an optimist a catholic uh at one of the smartest
most honest people i know now one of the main reasons why ronald reagan ran on tax cuts in 1980
is because jeffrey bell decided to go to his native new jersey and challenge clifford case in
republican primary and thus prove the strength of that idea rest in peace jeff bell

this is pollen block in the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
from specific farms experience less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose itchy watery
eyes and excessive mucus production they began studying the effects in public trials in their
public trials now we are introducing the fruit of the research a fast-acting chewable tablet
just two two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working
in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress enjoy the air you breathe naturally
with fast-acting pollen block available now at info wars life dot com or by calling till three
triple eight two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host roger stone sitting in for alex jones when
i was in the uk uh there's a lot of discussion about the delays in the effectuating of the brexit
decision by the people of that country now we see uh advocates for brexit members of parliament who
supported it being subjected to an unprecedented number of death threats this is not unlike what
is now happened today where uh donald trump jr who is very clearly emerging as an important
spokesman for the trump reform movement his tweets are really outstanding he uh is not
fettered by the white house staff can say what he really thinks we know that he is a regular
watcher of info wars uh and that he uh takes alternative conservative media links and puts
them out there for the legions of the president's supporters to see and to circulate now it is
extraordinary that his daughter vanessa his eldest child uh had to be taken or was taken
to a manhattan hospital as a precaution after she received an envelope of some kind of white powder
clearly meant it meant as some type of threat this is the tolerance of the liberals this is the this
is the uh this is the mindset of the increasingly violent left the same people who are threatening
members of parliament over brexit are the people sending uh this kind of garbage through the mail
i don't mean literally but it is interesting because and alex jones pointed this out to me
the brexit vote is the same populist uprising that elected donald trump it's the same populist
uprising we see across europe it is a rejection of globalism it is a rejection of the surrender
of the sovereignty of free people everywhere uh and it is extraordinary that the left has two tactics
censorship and threats they can't win a debate russia limbaugh was absolutely right the other day
when he said that the uh that uh there's a major effort on the tech left to limit info wars and
the other alternative media uh sites but more precisely this very cabal this kind of thinking
has surrounded the president now when i was in florida for these terrific speeches in naples and
tallahassee and so on a lot of trump supporters were scratching their heads about exactly what's
going on with general john kelly and the white house staff and of course the rob porter scandal
uh and we can report exclusively that general kelly was grooming rob kelly rob porter pardon
me to be the incoming white house chief of staff you see uh general kelly believes that
he is going to go over to run the department of defense and that general mattis will not fill
out the term uh and porter was being groomed this is why i believe that general kelly overlooked
credible reports of spousal abuse by mr porter now uh we also exclusively reported here at info
wars that the president uh felt out tom barrick thomas j barrick jr of colony capital a los angeles
real estate opportunity fund literally the president's closest personal friend appear
and there are very few a man of enormous capability a man who uh who the president trusts and he has
declined the chief of staff job but just the fact that the president is feeling people out tells me
that general kelly is on the skids now uh there is uh no uh there's no rejoicing over this fact
because unfortunately general kelly and rob porter and sadly hope hex who i think is a good person
and a trump loyalist have been in the forefront of those keeping the info wars from the president
keeping breitbart the daily caller rush limbaugh the president is not getting this news instead
he's getting politico and the new york times they have done the president a disservice because
the movement that elected donald trump uh had its had its vibrant message in the alternative media
it is only the technological advances that that mean that are uh that uh the majority of americans
are getting their news from the internet uh and therefore uh you've had the rise of a robust and
vite and uh vibrant alternative media so that when the mainstream media the three major networks
abc nbc and cbs and the two later the two cable news networks started trashing donald trump started
being a de facto advertising for the clinton campaign there were alternative sources of information
info wars being among the leaders is only because of that that we're able to pull off and donald
trump has said it several times this wasn't his victory it was the people's victory the greatest
upset in american history now uh it is vital in my opinion that the president's next chief of staff
and his next communications director keep him apprised of the alternative media of the
conservative alternative media we're carrying the banner for the trump administration alex jones
has had the president's back every step of the way when others who are faint of heart flipped out
over the nbc uh billy bush revelations alex jones never blinked either did the folks here at info
wars we've got the president's back and i know that he knows that but we're doing so many good
investigative reports here we are really breaking it down for the activists so that they can
retweet it it's important that the president knows uh what we're doing because those things
have a habit of ending up in his twitter feed and no he's not going to give up his twitter feed
it's interesting that the general kelly's never been able to get control of the president's twitter
feed that's because the president jealously guards it he likes it in fact i think he loves it
and it allows him to communicate directly with the american people unfiltered
now i've said in a hundred speeches no one puts words in donald trump's mouth no one puts ideas
in his head he's his own strategist he's his own phrase maker he's his own tweet master
he's his own press secretary and he's a genius he understands the new cycle like few others
and if you want the unalloyed absolute undiluted donald trump we're gonna just follow his twitter
feed he destroys the left they used to do it in 140 characters now he's got a few characters more
uh it is essential that in my opinion there'd be a house cleaning that general kelly uh go on
to serve the administration in some other capacity he's done some great things taking on congresswoman
the congresswoman from florida for example on the immigration issue but i don't think he's
serving the president well when he blocks him from information that he must have to win the
greater fight now there's talk of alternatives congressman kevin mccarthy is a name that comes
up newt gingrich i don't think any of those people would be the president's next chief of staff
and we'll keep you posted here at info wars on exactly what's going on

going to run here lania did not get me out of the white house we're installing coal burning

get to talk directly to the camera gas fireplaces from gas fireplaces dot com the best big league well
there you have it a terrific spot funny uh and satire without being overtly political or nasty
congratulations john d dominico as someone who's known donald trumpin studied his speech patterns
myself for many years you nailed it you really nailed it thank you very much roger i'm very
excited to be on the show i have to tell you how are you it's it's great so uh now it's my
understanding that you as an impressionist you have you've done other characters but yeah this
seems to be your new calling i mean this is uh that's as good as it gets me someplace alex
Baldwin is killing himself right now somewhere well i've been doing trump since 2004 uh right
around the end of the first season of the apprentice when there was a big demand corporately
for trump to come in and roast people and do apprentice games and things like that so i've
had a really long runway with him and to learn his voice and to really get it down especially
these last two and a half years yeah it's interesting i've seen other impressionists out
there on the circuit and they seem to focus on the physicality of donald trump his hand motions
and so on but you you combine the both his gestures uh and his idiosyncratic speech believe me
believe me believe me he's got a lot of you know it's really interesting and you you obviously know
him personally but it seems like his in the since he's announced he's become more physical and his
speech has become more him it seems like he seems like he was very restricted on the apprentice
blue team green team he did a good job but blue team you're fired it was kind of he seems so big
in a way well i think uh that on the network television show he was using the teleprompter
and now what you see is donald trump out there being donald trump and it it comes across as genuine
comes across as authentic uh you know even when the president makes a mistake people say well
you see that he's not one of these cookie cutter blow dried phony politicians uh he he speaks from
the heart he speaks from the gut he is the best instinctual politician that's kind of an insult
he's the best instinctual political leader uh in my lifetime and he doesn't rely on a giant bank
of polls or focus groups to decide what to say it's it's all trump all the time you know his
opponents in the primaries used to complain that why is he getting a disproportionate amount of
the coverage well as you know john it's because he's interesting it's because it's because that it's
real you never know what he might say it's not scripted uh but uh this is uh now you've actually
appeared as trump in four feature films which is pretty amazing and and i like this you were an
intern for my friend us senator arland specter right i spent a year doing that yeah i've always
you know i've always had an interest it it's funny that trump has become president i've always had
an interest in politics the first album i ever bought was david fries nixon a four-year fantasy
which you which i would think you might be familiar with i most definitely have it yes there's no
question here david fries my ever bought david fries richard nixon was incredible much better
than rich little not even close not even close and he was also a great writer is uh david fry was
an amazing comedic writer and gabe kaplan was on that album with him and he just he his whole album
was a concept album album and it was hilarious it was just so funny and so prescient in the moment
well you had the opportunity to work for arland specter i fought with him over the single bullet
theory over many many martinis he would never a lot of bad yeah he would never give an inch even though
he was wrong uh and he later went on and did a stand-up routine in philadelphia he always wanted
to be a stand-up comedian when he was in the senate he sent to the library of congress for every book
on stand-up comedy read them all and then he actually yeah he actually you can find it on youtube
but he went to a club and he did a set it was it was you know it was a u.s senator trying
to be a comedian but it's just something he always wanted to do well i i would think you told me that
yeah you can find it on youtube it's it's pretty entertaining i would think that your uh that your
career will get uh an enormous boost when the president runs for reelection i mean yeah i would
i would think so i you know when he first announced it was kind of a not a slow i mean i got it since
i had been doing it for so long i had done him in so many other platforms that uh when he announced
i was i wanted to make sure that he was a hundred percent in the race and then right around the
time he made the john mccain comment he was going up and i thought well that's interesting it's kind
of counter-intuitive and i thought to myself you know if he can make it to the first if he
can make it to the first debate i'll be set for the fall because that's how you know they book
out months in advance and he's corporate things and as you well know not only did he make it to
the first debate he crushed it in the first debate and the second debate and third debate and then
things just started taking off and a friend of mine tom shillow who is on he's still on fox news
but he was on the show red eye um he brought me on i think i did about 50 60 appearances on red
eye as trump and then because of that i did fox and friends a number of times so it was a great
platform and we did some really wonderful comedy and then some other shows picked me up and then
voiceovers and the corporate stuff and it's been kind of it's pretty much taken over my there's tom
right now tom shillow a very funny guy and he's right very funny guy in his own right very funny
great writer too so we so we had a great run until his show unfortunately was cancelled but now he's
on fox radio uh so that was uh that really got me out there early on and uh it was it was great for
it was great to do comedy with him again because we had done it in the early 90s together well as
you know the the the pundits in the mainstream didn't see trump coming so i can see why it started
slowly they were the last people in the world who thought that he would win what was it jeb bush
said you're not going to elected president you're not going to insult your way into the presidency
guess what jeb wrong wrong and i don't know if this is in your notes i was on um channel
four bbc matt fear they had flown me over um to dc i'm here in los vegas they flew me to dc to do
a story on me and uh i had said at the end of the interview he said uh who do you think will win
and i said donald trump on the landslide i said i've been on the road now for well over a year
doing this character and what i have seen overwhelmingly he is going to win all right

planet thanks for joining us here in the alex jones show

you're listening to the alex jones show
i follow americans let me make this perfectly clear you're listening to roger stone
on and forth
welcome back
you're on the alex jones show i'm your host roger stone you know there's nothing more pathetic
than watching the mainstream media talking heads and the columnists and editorial writers at the
washington post in the new york times trying to breathe life back into the russian collusion
delusion i mean this piece by nicholas christoff is one of the most pathetic attempts to muddy the
waters that i have seen reiterating a bunch of innocuous garbage about trump's connections with
the russians a hundred thousand dollar facebook campaign that would be in a multimillion dollar
presidential campaign tata mont to urinating in the ocean uh the donald trump jr meeting of
course christoff never mentions that the russian woman lawyer who met with donald trump jr and
provided nothing of interest was in the country illegally and she had no visa he even takes a
shot at me recycling the same garbage that i specifically addressed in my sworn testimony
in front of the house intelligence committee yes my communications with goose fur 2.0 which is now
entirely public is innocuous it's benign and mr christoff doesn't mention that it happened
almost six weeks after the publication of the wiki leaks disclosures regarding hillary clinton
he also reiterates the same tired hackney falsehoods that i knew about julie nissange's
uh a publication of john podesta's emails in advance i never said anything of the kind i did
know that podesta was a bad actor because the panama papers published in january of 2016
outlined his shady business dealings in russia the uranium deal the gas deal the banking deal
you didn't have to be a genius to say that he would come under scrutiny in other words his time
in the barrel would come nor did i have any advanced knowledge beyond what assange himself said
about wiki leaks publication of hillary clinton's emails and other documents from the clinton campaign
assange said this himself in numerous interviews but mr christoff ignored all of that
uh then we had this extraordinary interview with christoff and this guy richard painter who is
the ethics lawyer uh in the from the bush administration that's kind of like being a
meat eating vegetarian this performance is one of the most incredible things i have ever seen
listen to this guy blather uh and just keep insisting that things are true that have been
completely discredited i want to get your reaction to build crystals tweet because we have to separate
the two wall this is unprecedented it's ridiculous we don't like it it's unprofessional what is it
actually doing well it's like they're modding our national security there's classified information
in this my mom and the only person who's going to benefit from it being released is vladimir
pooten he's going to find out more about our sources and how we knew uh the various associates of
donald trump uh were collaborating with the russians i mean that's what this is about it's uh
going to expose our intelligence operations uh to the benefit of vladimir pooten uh president
trump's own justice department has said that the memo is misleading his own fbi including his own
fbi director in version not be released uh this is an abuse uh of our intelligence apparatus
pack on our intelligence apparatus for political purposes and the only winner is vladimir pooten
america is just disgusted is it because president trump won't mind if vladimir pooten wins as long
as he wins now there's real true news analysis right there look i can't believe that this guy
richard painter is admitted to the bar i can't believe that he's actually teaching law school
he continues to lie about russian collusion he continues to attack me among others there is
no there there mr painter virtually everything you're saying has been disproved and then in the
interview uh both painter and the aforementioned nick christoff go on to claim that devin newness
the crusading and i think courageous chairman of the house intelligence committee is taking
money from the russians that's a smear that's a lie that's character assassination now you see why
nobody's watching ms nbc uh we've already seen uh uh joe scarborough soil himself with this nonsense
but these clowns christoff and painter this is really about as pathetic as it gets i am going
to be writing a piece for info wars counter pointing mr christoff's piece because it is so
wrongheaded it is so recycled it's the same tired nonsense you got to wonder whether christoff like
mike isikoff is being fed by deep state operatives so that his story can be used to prop up a false
narrative as the newness memo has told us the deep state did with mike isikoff of yahoo news
the uh the extraordinary thing here is that the other day i was talking to michael caputo
who has appeared here at info wars and uh this entire investigation has taken an extraordinary
toll on his family now he has just been notified that he is going to be called back in front of the
house uh judiciary committee and the house pardon me the senate judiciary committee
and the senate intelligence committee now if the members of those august committees would simply
read mr caputo's sworn testimony before the house intelligence committee they would know
that they are wasting both his time and the taxpayers money by having him come and testify
my own lawyers have been notified that the senate judiciary committee will call me once again i urge
them to do what mr christoff should have done at the new york times read my sworn testimony in which
i address the entire question of julian assange and wiki leaks now when i was in the united kingdom
i went by the tiny cramped ecuadorian embassy to drop off my business card for julian assange
no i did not see him i didn't ask to see him i didn't ask for an appointment i did this to
punk the british media indeed the mainstream media in both britain and the united states because
they are among the leaders in continuing to promulgate this myth that julian assange is anything
other than an honest journalist doing his job no wiki leaks is not a russian front it's a news
organization a news organization with a better track record for accuracy and authenticity than say the
new york times or the washington post and what about the hypocrisy of celebrating this movie
the paper which is a essentially a celebration of the a courageous publication by the newspapers
the new york times in the washington post of classified information that pertained to the
the origins of the vietnam war so this is the same media that wants to prosecute julie assange for the
the publishing of classified information yet we're celebrating the publishing of classified
information in this hollywood epic extraordinary the hypocrisy doesn't end there in the lawsuit
where i am being sued with donald trump by a group called project democracy and obama
blessed front group which is really just using my name to raise money the president's lawyers
from joan day went into court only days ago and said that there can be no conspiracy because
wiki leaks publication of classified information of any information is not a crime that's what
journalists do well somebody needs to tell the president's government lawyers that because jeff
sessions and the folks at the justice department are continuing in their persecution of julie
nissange assange is in poor health and he has now been there i believe six years in what is a very
tiny cramp space don't get the idea that the embassy is opulent that columbia and ecuador share
one embassy it is time for the president to order the justice department to end the persecution
of julie nissange or failing that simply pardon him for any non-existent crimes that he may have
committed he is the most valiant journalist of his time and he is not a russian agent this this
continued insistence by john brennan and uh and james clapper oh you remember him clappers the guy
who testified under oath that we have no metadata collection program and of course when edward
snowden released documents showing that that was false clapper paid no penalty where is he now

sobeck who is uh who i affectionately call jumping jack flash because he's always ahead of the
mainstream media in terms of breaking news in washington he's got terrific sources and he is
out there every day on the ramparts way ahead of cnn and the other fake news sites so jack tell us
what's going on in washington and what is the drama surrounding the white house staff shuffle
well roger what i'm hearing right now so much is of course the departure of rob porter within the
handling or apparent mishandling of this story uh that broke in the daily mail of his potential these
alleged uh wife uh domestic abuse by his two prior ex-wives he resigned and then the white
house team is seemingly putting out multiple stories regarding the timeline of his resignation
and how it was handled by chief of staff john kelly it now seems to me that the real target of all
of this is not was not rob porter but the target seems to be to hang this as a news for chief of
staff kelly and get him out of there well my sources tell me that kelly is telling others
that he's toast so i think he's reading the handwriting on the wall what's surprising to
me is that i i know rob porter's father roger porter served in the bush administration i have
first hand sources who tell me when he was at harvard at the kennedy school that he was roasting
donald trump he was belittling him uh and of course the the porters are bush republicans
makes you wonder what he was doing in the bush white house to begin with and precisely this is
a guy who was not brought in from great again dot gov of course that database of trump supporter
resumes which was supposedly lost by mr ryan's previous the prior chief of staff this was a
guy who was brought in by the establishment well ryan's previous gave us rod roger stein appears
he also gave us rob porter jack sobeck will be back in the host chair here at the alex
jong show stay tuned

rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones
jack sobeck coming to you live with this fourth hour of the alex jones program taking over for
the amazing the great roger stone who was hosting just prior to me the breaking shocking news the
situation that we're dealing with right now the possible terrorist attack on donald trump
junior his wife venessa trump rushed to the hospital possible exposure by a white powder
substance certainly reminiscent of the anthrax scare of 2001 immediately following the 9-11
attacks these envelopes were sent to members of congress were sent to members of the senate were
were all going around capital hill there's still a special mail procedure at capital hill to go
and investigate envelopes because of that scare from 2001 17 years ago almost 17 years ago she
did apparently it seems that she opened the envelope was exposed was coughing felt nauseous
called 9-11 rushed to the hospital two other individuals were also reported to have been
exposed to this powder they are also being brought to the hospital because they want to make sure
that everything is going to be okay that everything is certainly going to be okay with her the police
have announced so far that they have determined that the substance was they in their words innocuous
and innocuous white substance they have not come out to officially deny it was of course anthrax
or or that type of powder but details are still coming in as we go so we're certainly going to
be keeping a very close watch on this situation however the one thing i want to explain to folks
is that leftists now to include even some members of the mainstream media or contributors to the
mainstream media are making jokes about this they're laughing about this a domestic terrorist attack
or possible domestic terrorist attack on the first family we have here a huffington post writer a
former writer for them is now joking that she's going being brought to the hospital due to a
coke binge this is something that that she just posted this this former writer of huffington post
on twitter immediately after the hospitalization of the president's daughter-in-law no idea what
her mental her what her health state was no idea was going but the first joke was what's the over
under and i'll read this what's the over under that it was just her coke dealer dropping off the
usual but she did too much and this is a cover story so conspiracy theories but because you'd
have to be on the drugs to be married to uday and also they're they're all lying attention uh
that word happy to cause distractions so uday of course a reference here to the murderous and brutal
son of saddam hussein uday hussein a complete sociopath known for committing violent acts sexual
assaults uh extreme brutality to his own citizens and that is what they're comparing comparing
donald trump jr a patriot who has been falsely accused and falsely defamed of being a a traitor
to his country to being a traitor to his father for all of these things uh all of it for committing
the cardinal sin apparently of supporting his father for president this is the left ladies and
gentlemen you know we we talk a lot about how we say you know i one one thing i read on twitter
sometimes is daily reminder that the left once you and your family dead alex talks about that
sort of thing all the time and he gets attacked oh now she's now she's put up a uh a thing saying
well i i just made a dumb twitter joke but but you should know that they have a history of coke
abuse and you should just pretend this is not worse than the administration i mean she's she's
put up a non-apology here basically deleted the tweet put up a non-apology calling it a snowflake
dog whistle that is sounded as a distraction uh no miss dublin the only attention that we're
trying to call to is the fact that white powder was sent in an envelope opened by vanessa trump
the daughter-in-law of the president of the united states it was addressed to her husband it was
addressed to her husband donald trump jr right so she's saying that she's not and you can look
here at the great article on info wars dot com she says i'm not a contributor for huffington post
but then you can and she's she's going back at paul joseph watson he and i were calling this out
and then you could scroll down and here's her profile page on huffington post tara dublin if
you're a writer living uh living in portland organ so there there it is huffington post
has her up as a contributor now she might be lazy and has not contributed anything recently to the
to the huffington post and that's really on her but the fact remains that she is a contributor
to the huffington post still has articles on their website so because we know that huffington post
has taken down articles in the past when they didn't like their contributors david seamen of
course who wrote an article about hillary's health was a contributor to the huffington post he was
that that was completely deleted it was memory hold because they didn't want anything anyone
to be questioning hillary during the 2016 election so her contributor posts are still up on huffington
post so i really am confused this is like if you guys remember not too long ago uh just about a
week ago really when a cnn contributor was making a joke about the train crash the republican train
crash that was carrying republicans and their families their wives their children out to a
retreat in west virginia there was a train crash and a cnn commentator uh made some horrific joke
about the whole thing said that that he thought it was great didn't you know basically praised it
and was mocking it and making jokes and then cnn cnn came back and said oh well he's not a contributor
for us yet we went to the cnn website the cnn uh vice president even came out and responded to me
said jacky this this guy is wrong you know this guy isn't a contributor we went to cnn's website
we went to cnn's website and found that he had posted and i can't remember the guy's name at the
top of my head i'm sorry i'm sorry producers i can't remember his name at the top of my head
he had posted articles uh columns on cnn within the past two weeks within the past two weeks he
had articles on cnn's site sam stein was also out there uh was putting up stuff and yet cnn had
the audacity to claim that he was not a contributor oh keith boykin that was the guy yes keith boykin
he said uh he said is this a metaphor for american politics today right yet cnn said and and we found
video of him talking with anderson cooper recently not years ago recently yet cnn told us that he
was not a contributor that he was not a commentator even though his articles were hosted on their
website and we had video of him with uh you know with anderson cooper that would be like me saying
that i have no connection whatsoever to info wars i certainly do i'm here as a guest host right now
like doing doing the fourth hour right so again this is what cnn does this is what the left
does they lie they simply lie and when one of their own notice how fast they eat their own by the way
and how they don't stand up for each other and how they don't defend each other then the minute one
of their own screws up the minute one of their own goes over the line they immediately throw them to
the wolves they have no backing of them whatsoever and they even deny the fact that they had a
relationship with that person despite shocking and clear evidence to the contrary in the form of
articles hosted on their websites and forms of in terms of videos so this this shows you who we
are dealing with when it comes to the left their ability seemingly uh endless ability to lie to
obfuscate to spread myths truths and disinformation and is and also to mock to laugh at a gory
grisly situation of course the first case being a train crash the second now being a potential
potentially fatal situation where again we do not know the facts at this point they say it was
an innocuous substance they have not said what the white powder was they have not officially uh and
i'm going to check as we go over the break here i'm going to check to make sure uh if there are any
official statements that have come out yet from from uh the hospital regarding venessa trump here
we go another one saying donald's it's a pity that don trump jr didn't open it right the junior
didn't open it and this this envelope folks i wanted to remind you this envelope was addressed to
donald trump jr a father of five the son of the president of the united states this is what's going
on in the united states this is what's going on in america this is what the left has come to in our
country right they're celebrating about it again we have no information regarding who sent it we
have no information regarding uh how this came out what exactly was in the envelope we pray of
course we keep venessa trump and her and don and his entire family all the kids in our prayers
secret service whether they were involved uh it seems likely that they may have also been involved
in this we pray that everyone is okay that is who we are will the left apologize for their
statements and will the left join us in praying for peace and safety jack was over stick right here

jack masoby coming back live here from washington dc where i sit live
in our nation's swampy capital which of course is currently being drained by the drainer in chief
president donald john trump i've just received some information some breaking information in this
case we're covering it the last segment regarding the possible terrorist attack on donald trump
junior his wife essentially being the one that opened the letter now we were told it was an
envelope that contained white powder the information has now just been released that the white
powder envelope addressed to donald trump junior was postmarked from boston so it was
postmarked from boston and that it included an angry note so again for people saying that this
may have just been an accident may have been something else in there this does appear to be
either some sort of threat related to politics or some type of prank in that sense hopefully
just a prank but of course the situation is still being being discussed one of my sources one of
my very close sources i've just been in touch with they seem to indicate they think that everyone
has been stabilized at the hospital right now i'm in direct contact with a source but i haven't
been able to get the the final a okay from everyone yet so i want to hold off on that
until there is an official statement to let everybody know it does appear that donald trump
juniors children his five children were not at home at the time being in the middle of the day
so it seems they may have been at school when this happened hopefully none of them of course
were involved this breaking story a lot of developments going on what make sure to stay
here because we never know hopefully the situation doesn't take a turn for the worse
hopefully you can stay with us and we'll be able to report very very soon that everything was okay
that it was just a threat but it's possible it's also possible that this may have been a test
that this may have been a test run to see what type of response level there would be from the
secret service what whether or not an envelope could make it all the way through any layers
of security that they have and it clearly did in this case to be able to be opened by not donald
trump junior not the president's son but the president's daughter-in-law venessa trump so
it seems that whatever security procedures are in place they have been penetrated this is
a penetration of the security the secret service network revolving around the trump family the first
family and absolutely represents a clear and present danger just in terms of the security breach
alone the fact that one of this this is why for example if you go see trump at a rally if you go
see the president at one of his rallies they will tell you if you bring something if you bring a
letter some people bring books some people bring artwork and they say well i want to give this
letter to the president and it might just be a trump fan and say i i wrote this great letter i
want to give it to the president can i give it to him you can't give that to them it is secret
service protocol to not accept any object any object foreign object that is handed to them at a
rally that does not go through testing to get to the first family and certainly in this case to get
to the president so again i'm not knocking the secret service detail around president trump
june or excuse me donald trump jr his family but it does seem that the security measures
do need to be reviewed they do need to be checked because this was a security penetration
this was what it what it's called it's an infiltration of their security okay it's a compromise
it's this is called compromise the first family has been compromised i bro i was covering the story
a few weeks ago as well when people were hacking uh the twitter accounts of of people who followed
real donald trump on twitter they followed the president's twitter account well there was this
this group called the turkish hacker army and the turkish a cyber army was hacking people
who followed who donald trump followed then they were able to use those hacked accounts
eric falling was one of them gretta bin sustrin they were able to use these hacked accounts david
clerk to send messages to the president through direct message the direct message function on
twitter now if he had clicked on any of the links that they sent or the photos or the videos that
they had sent he then may have downloaded malware from the turkish cyber army uh which
potentially has connections to the turkish government it seems they're certainly very
supportive of urdogan the president there so he then the president of the united states think about
this there would have been malware from the turkish cyber army on the president's of united
states phone or any platform that he was using to access twitter of course he usually access it
from his phone then that could have been set up as a surveillance function that could have been set
up for access into his text messages his other direct messages with people who and more more
more more shockingly they could have taken control of president trump's twitter account
if they had taken control of president trump's twitter account imagine just imagine
what they could have tweeted out that would have certainly sent the entire world into a
head spin that would have had massive implications for world security and world stability so these
are the things we are talking about these are the cases of essentially and here's the here's
the article you guys can go see if you go check out my medium site medium.com back slash jack
posovic where i talked about this i actually just i actually talked to the turkish cyber
hackers because it turns out that they follow some of the accounts that they hacked were people who
followed me so i sent messages to them and essentially got an interview with a few of them
they gave me their manifesto in turkish i had it professionally translated i broke this story i put
the exclusive out there they are pro urdogan they are against what the united states is doing they
are trying to push back on this and they were using highly effective cyber techniques to do this
they were able to compromise the security of the united states of america this is the issue folks
this is the issue that came up today with this compromise on the president's son
hopefully not anything in terms of the will come of this hospitalization of venezia trump
we of course keep her in our prayers so a lot of heavy stuff there folks a lot of heavy stuff
but i do want to take a very quick second before the segment ends and remind you that we can't

a lot of stuff going on today a lot of news coming out here
washington dc we're talking about the things that are going on in the white house we're talking
about the things that are going on in new york city this possible terrorist attack against
donald trump junior but there's also there's also news from europe and that is something
that is being completely overlooked right now in the face of this north korean charmer charm
offensive of course the propaganda being repeated by the new york times and cnn from kim jong-un's
sister they're completely overlooking a lot of and there's a there's cnn's new logo sort of a
meme that uh that i put up yesterday just popped it up there i think this is what we should call
cnn's new logo as they as they push out um their their propaganda story and their propaganda
friends over at north korea and i'd like to just take a quick second to remind everybody
that who exactly this person is and what exactly it is that she supports this is they're saying
kim jong-un's sister stealing the show at winter olympics they're reporting on her as if she's
uh simply the sister of a duly elected president of a democratic country or or whether she's someone
who's a senior advisor to a prime minister no she is the sister of a brutal tyrannical dictator
a communist totalitarian genocidal maniac and why do i say genocidal because i've read the stories
about the korean concentration camps that are in north korea harvard university press put this out
and i read this in a video last last night harvard university press put out a book called the little
black book of communism uh this came out several years ago but at that point they had estimated
that over 1.5 million prisoners had died in the concentration camps of north korea the
concentration camps that are run by kim yo jong's family people are have said survivors have excuse
me holocaust survivors have said that north korea's prisons are even worse than the than the
circumstances of the nazi concentration camps like auschwitz they're actually saying the human
and experimentation that goes on in north korea the cremation of bodies the brutal rape and assault
of women in these prisons and by the way if you become pregnant if one of these women become
pregnant after being raped they're then executed because it is against the rules to be pregnant
in one of the north korean concentration camps these are this is the holocaust of our day
that's going on right now today in north korea prisoners who looked like walking skeletons
logging camps in cyberia where prisoners are kept under extreme conditions and are forced to work
in these logging camps in the bitter cold i mean can you imagine what february and north korea or
cyberia is like right now unimaginable the and of course you know that the the camps where they're
kept they don't have uh they don't exactly have central heating or insulation or any of the different
that ways to keep them them warm okay these missile test sites that are very close up to north korea
that missile test set test site they're very close to the city of of nanjin and ham hong
so north korea we're talking as well about these concentration camps up there these are the camps
the kim yo jong's family owns runs and treats the people there the political prisoners many of them
like slaves if you would defect from north korea your entire family will be sent to one of these
camps your entire family but the media roiders new york times cnn they called her a a prim young
woman with a high forehead and hair half swept back with quiet gazes they described the head held
high as she worked in these are people these are people who run concentration camps these are slave
owners to put it in another way in another sense anyone who defects their family is immediately
sent to the concentration camp no question about it uh any female who's in the every almost 100% of
the females in these concentration camps are are sexually assaulted or raped almost 100% but of course
when kim yo jong comes down the entire who is by the way one of the heads of the north korean
propaganda department okay this is her job her actual job is to spread propaganda for north korea
for their communist regime across the world the entire media does it for her now look folks we
know why they're doing this we know they're doing this because kim yo jong and the kim family is
against trump and so the media thinks well if we're against trump too the left the left side of the
media i should say the old media so if we're against trump we should then praise the regime of north
korea and praise this uh uh representative of it now you look you look at the these cheerleaders
in north korea the 200 cheerleaders these are slaves by the way i want to i want to make sure
everyone is 100 clear when i say this these are slaves they are forced in there they are forced
to perform these acts if they do not perform these acts uh horrific abuses will happen then
we talked about ude who's saying earlier today that is what would happen to these cheerleaders
and if any of them so much as was suspected of trying to defect to south korea
they'd be disappeared within seconds within seconds before being brought back
or after being upon being brought back to the north korea which is known as the hermit regime
you know a lot of people a lot of people talk about what's to be done about the north korean
situation whether we can use diplomacy or we have to use military force north korea of course
has the fourth largest standing army in the world that's because they put so much of their economy
so much of their country's wealth into maintaining that military because number one they have to keep
down the people inside and created the world's most horrific totalitarian police state uh far
harsher far worse than anything you'd find out of hollywood in terms of dystopian movies
and number two because they know that any incursion by north korea by the united states
or excuse me south korea or the united states would lead to their downfall so if that regime ever
was under the threat or felt that they were under the threat of collapse from either invasion by
south korea invasion by china p s people have have suggested uh or a u.s military action there is no
question there is no question that north korea would launch their full might of their ballistic
missiles on all of their enemies to include everyone in south korea to include uh us bases
in guan in guam and japan again folks this regime was threatening to nuke the united states
about six months ago it was just over the summer it was just over the summer they were threatening
to uke the united states but suddenly cnn and new york times love them and see and they want to
they want to praise these people who are just threatening to nuke us and wipe our territory
of guam off the face of the map so and i would also like to state though uh just in regards
to their nuclear arsenal that which they would certainly use north korea also has an extremely
active chemical weapons program those chemical weapons would almost certainly be used within
the first hours if not minutes of any conflict between the north and the south militarily and
we're not talking about their icbm's their intercontinental ballistic missiles we're
talking about srbm's uh short range ballistic missiles pretty much the entirety of the country
of south korea would be within range of any one of these missiles because folks we're not talking
about two countries the size of the united states and china here we're talking about two countries
that are about the size of two u.s states this would be like the state of ohio declaring war
on the state of indiana right everything they have is right next to each other the two capitals of
soul in pyeongyang are extremely close to each other so any situation that led to military conflict
we'd have to understand we would have to accept millions dead on both sides of the border and
if we're trying to peacefully unite the peninsula or peacefully unite it we need to be very careful
about what exactly it is that we're willing to do to get to that situation and that's why
we need to be very careful about using military force but at the same time we cannot allow the
north koreans to threaten us with their nuclear arsenal jack posovic talking about very complex
north korea issues and the media's complete capitulation to communist propaganda the walter
doranti award is certainly certainly up for grabs and i think cnn is going to get it uh come back
let we've got one more segment left here on a big fourth hour of info wars introducing cell force
by info wars life cell force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection mitochondria produce
over 95 of your energy they are your body's cellular engines cell force helps promote your

your mitochondria don't run at 100 efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen species
top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these
reactive oxygen species the antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful
available on the market the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these
reactive oxygen species and other free radicals boost protect and adapt with cell force from info

day gift from the info wars store isn't that right so i wanted to talk break down an issue
out of europe right now that's going on that's not getting a lot of press however it has to do
with russia and that's kind of what struck me is so surprising because russia has led the
headlines for any other story that's going on right now did you know did you know that russia
is building another pipeline to germany another pipeline directly to europe now you'd think wait
a minute i keep hearing about russia all day long from these democrats in the us senate and the us
house why aren't they saying anything why aren't they saying a word about this pipeline jack are
you fake news no right here germany has just granted the pipeline permits okay so they need
to get permits to build this thing out it's a connection between moscow and brussels essentially
with the european union really moscow and berlin with merkel's government
putin is getting his way with this pipeline this is completely said it's called the Nordstrom
Nord Stream 2 excuse me not Nordstrom Nord Stream 2 is built through the Baltic Sea and it's going to
be a gas prom run line connecting a natural gas transfer from russia into germany so i want to
remind folks that just because merkel is out there all day long talking about russia
saying that and we've got the map of it here for you all to see it goes right through the
Baltic there bypassing estonia lithuania latvia poland and then back into directly into germany
even though even though merkel and these dem these democrat leftists say they're so anti-putin
she still is stuck on natural gas and still the political ramifications of her not supporting
this huge pipeline deal with russia i don't think would be enough for her party uh or her
newly formed coalition to be able to go through it with anything they would absolutely be run out
of town because if people understand this that the price of gas the price of just going to fill
up your car in europe is so much so that's why they're even willing to turn over to the russians
turn over to putin to get this out regardless of knowing that any chance putin wants he can
simply turn off that switch and he can simply cut it off so imagine the leverage now that russia
is going to have over putin and there's a lot of people saying there's a lot of people saying
that is russian gas good for america well one thing that i would point out is that america
in many ways is becoming energy independent and actually a net exporter of energy under the
trump administration so many american states now to include pennsylvania my home state are actually
exporting energy from natural gas from fracking that's going out across the world but these are
the same democrat senators that are usually saying we need to stand up to russia we need to stand up
to putin but when it comes to an actual situation where russia is cutting into a potential exporter
for our energy right so we're going to become net energy exporter by 2022 which will be hopefully
during trump's second term we're on that pace so why then why are the democrat senators who are
normally so up in arms about russia not saying a single word about russia building this pipeline
which could go to a potential customer a potential market for american energy folks
this is the type of situation that president trump has been talking about for 30 years for 30 years
saying that other countries are laughing at us the way we get treated the way we get screwed
out of deals the way we don't understand what's really going on in the world we pay attention to
these phony russia collusion allegations etc etc meanwhile russia is building a pipeline to germany
and our companies are states that are trying to get their new newfound natural gas out of the country
that are trying to find more export markets for it are being shut down because russia is being
used now of course russia is a lot closer but you'd think that there would be some pressure from the
us at least diplomatically to say hey wait a second think of the security implications the
national security international security implications of signing such a crucial natural resource
agreement with the kremlin but it's not to be found so rex tillerson the u.s. secretary of state
said something about it he gave a speech recently the government of poland gave him a huge speech
urging germany not to do this but where's the u.s. ambassador to germany on all of this
has anyone heard about the u.s. ambassador to germany all this oh wait that's right we don't
have a u.s. ambassador to germany and why is that well because richard grenl who was approved to be
nominated by the house excuse me by the senate has been it's been refused to come up for a confirmation
vote by chuck schumer and mitch mcconnell so we've got richard grenl who is a an extreme patriot a
huge trump supporter he happens to be a gay republican so this would be trumps first gay ambassador
and possibly are our first openly gay ambassador to have to look that one up so why are they holding
him up why is chuck schumer holding him up why won't he allow allow this to happen we just
heard about berlin's cia as well this massive corrupt spying scheme that was that had that
had gone on where essentially cia agents were paying russians uh saying that they were going to get
this these naked pictures of trump naked video of trump and a bunch of nsa tools and the guy
handed over and said he didn't actually have any of that this russian agent completely troll he
trolled them he just he trolled them folks he allowed them to be able to to give them a hundred
thousand dollars and said and they were working on their way towards a million dollars in in terms of
our cia giving this guy money he didn't actually have any of these secrets he didn't have any
he didn't have any pictures of trump any video of trump he didn't have anything other than publicly
available documents so they the cia paid this guy a hundred thousand dollars and he handed them a copy
of the trump dossier and said cc look what i've got now if you guys just give me a hundred thousand
more dollars i'll give you better information you just just just keep paying me and the more you
pay me i'll get more money folks i think anybody can realize what's going on there this is a guy
who is trying to make a buck and realize that he could do bar intelligence agencies because the fact
he was russian and because of all the russia hysteria out there and he got a hundred thousand
dollars for it now that operation went down in germany had it been done in germany that means
that the u.s. ambassador would have had oversight of it but we don't have a u.s. ambassador we don't
have richard grannell there supporting our u.s. policies supporting u.s. diplomacy whether it's
helping our states find an export market for our natural resources that we want to sell this energy
that we want to sell to actually bring money back into our country after we've used it use the energy
of course for ourselves our own resources this is what we're talking about unleashing the american
economy unleashing the untapped potential of america but again because of politics because of
chuck schumer and to an extent mitch mcconnell for not getting richard grannell where again he's
ready to go he's ready to be in there he's ready to serve day one day one he will get on a plane
and fly to berlin the moment you tell him pass that today get him over there have him sort out
the situation with our state with our mission to berlin our diplomatic mission to berlin whether
it's this pipeline diplomacy these pipeline put in pipeline politics or the cia uh operation
selling these fake you know buying these fake secrets from russia jack vasovic i'm throwing my
hands at the whole thing i'm throwing my hands up in the air because i'm throwing my hands up
