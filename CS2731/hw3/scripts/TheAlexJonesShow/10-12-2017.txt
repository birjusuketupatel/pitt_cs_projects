Ladies and gentlemen it's incredible here we are another global transmission in
Hollywood's collapsing the NFL's collapsing the official cover-up of
Vegas has basically collapsed it's amazing but they're going to fight back
and it's all coming up today this transmission will be one for the record
books let's kick it off with John Bowne exposing the Satanic cesspool that is
Southern California Governor Jerry Brown is now pitching from left field Fox
News reports California health care workers who willfully and repeatedly
declined to use a senior transgender patients preferred name or pronouns
could face punishments ranging from a fine to jail time under a newly signed
law but that's just the appetizer for Governor Moonbeam's appetite for
self-destruction so far the HEPA virus has killed 17 and infected nearly 500
in the county nearly two-thirds are homeless or drug users but the rest are
from the general population the advice remains if you have yet to get your
vaccination for HEPA you need to get it the hepatitis A virus is highly
contagious and it is transmitted person to person by the fecal oral route the
fact that while this is a broad concern there is a targeted subgroup a very
focused subgroup in our community that is at high risk for which we have the
greatest concern include the homeless IV and illicit drug users men who have
sex with men individuals having sexual contact with someone who has the
hepatitis a man people with chronic liver disease individuals who have
clotting factor disorders now the signing of carefree dangerous blood
donation legislation during a massive hepatitis a outbreak in San Diego that
could actually spur a larger statewide epidemic breaks all the standards of
common sense safety and human rights the people that treat blood plasma as a
global commodity as broker brokerage as if it's gold or silver these people need
to be rained in some of my competitors resent this but I used to define the
United States as the opaque of blood because we supplied most of her now
they're gonna use California's the vector for the attack it's bio attack because
you need donors they know what they're doing the donors have to be free of
disease the brown Satanist but testing free of disease it's safe millions of
people over the centuries certainly the post-war period and yet with the
hepatitis the main problem is killed tens of thousands of people and a few years
we're still here as a planet don't have nuclear war I will go back to this show
and say here I am in 2017 saying within three to five years California will have
a 200% increase in HIV they will also complain and say we need single-payer we
need social self-care the reason we have HIV is because we don't have free health
care no the reason you have HIV is because it is a culture now in the gay
community that first read about 20 years ago in Rolling Stone to give other
people HIV it's truly nihilistic so here's the article progress LA Times
knowingly exposing others HIV no longer a felony in California it's the same
thing as a parking ticket so it's essentially legalized and here's the
LA Times Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony
to misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without
disclosing the infection how about hepatitis how about everything else the
measure also applies to those who give blood without telling blood bank they're
HIV positive oh wow don't tell the blood bank your HIV positive this is a
religion this is Satanism folks because they can get away with this thing
with anything this is totally insane remember the Clinton's row a decade knew
that all the blood coming out of their prisons was infected with HIV and
hepatitis fact rate is about how the state of Arkansas harvested bad blood
from its inmate population and infected thousands of patients around the world
with hepatitis C HIV AIDS meanwhile California is on fire massive earthquakes
in Mexico signal a big one hitting California any day now then there's the
unreliable water supply a mountain of debt a stagnant economy are just a few of
the issues facing this land of confusion that recently wanted to allow
communists to hold state jobs John bound reporting for info wars calm all the
perplexities the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in
their Constitution or confederation not from want of honor or virtue so much as
from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation
those are the words of John Adams the second president of the United States
are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve do you understand the nature of
our fiat currency you understand how a private corporation has the ability to
create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it what kind of leverage to
these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people or for that
matter what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money will you be
a slave or will you be free Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without
general knowledge among the people join the info word spread the information
educate yourself and others the truth shall set you free
Renfowars.com I'm David Knight
the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end
up on top the truth is humanity is coming down fast
but we're miles above on our journey to the world listening to the Alex Jones show
it's Thursday October 12th 2017 I'm your host Alex Jones are gonna be live
here for the next four hours and then when info wars live with your truly
Alex Jones hands oh and shroyer and the war rooms coming up around
syndicating 10 hours of transmission a day by the middle of next year we intend
to be 20 hours a day again thank you so much for joining us where to start I
think today I'll do what I do sometimes when the news is just overwhelming I
think I'll just read you headlines and then get into the meat potatoes on some
of the big specifics report FBI wiped phones and laptops of Las Vegas massacre
eyewitnesses wonder why they did that because of all the multiple shooter
videos oh now confirmed worker warned hotel before Las Vegas shooter opened
fire on crowd and folks were down on the crowd warning people and mainstream
media made fun of us and acted like that was fake they knew it wasn't fake they
know they're the liars we try to tell the truth doesn't mean we're right all the
time but we try to tell the truth big difference Vegas hotel worker warned
police a shooter before massacre happened but nothing was done 45 minutes
before not six minutes see notice it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger now
the entire story is not true we were the first to tell you all of it he wanted
the Middle East his girlfriend did he had millions of dollars he got shot he
didn't commit suicide there were multiple shooters on and on and on and on it's
all coming out oh look CBS news worker warned hotel before Las Vegas shooter
opened fire on crowd associated press as well here's info wars from a day
before Mandalay Bay owner what's being expressed by police may not be accurate
that's a nice way of telling you that the sheriff's department's been told a
lie since the FBI took over they stopped saying we think he was radicalized and
had to have help they now have been saying the opposite now that the FBI's
in charge oh and Newsweek's walked it back to saying yeah maybe ISIS is
involved we've got that report that's all coming up that's just that's just one
of the stacks that's only part of it but it's a big deal and boy they're just
hoping everybody forgets about it right now oh we're not hearing from Keith
Overman and Hillary and everybody's saying gun owners are to blame and
conservatives are blame and Christians are to blame and white people are to
blame and aren't you all guilty aren't you all bad let's let's ban those bump
stocks right now because they've already banned belt-fed machine guns back in the
30s and that's what was getting used not bump stocks so they're all kind of
wanting you to forget about it now because we blew their official story
wide open and we created a united front to make it okay for the real witnesses
to come forward and now CNN and CBS are having the victims on the people that
saw the multiple shooters and they're changing the subject wow they've changed
the timeline showing their response time wasn't good we started 45 minutes
before just changing the subject not to wow why'd they lie about it all what
really happened it just becomes they covered up for response time no they
had shooters all over the city and took a bunch of them out that were probably
diversions for the main attack that came unice's attack and we've got coming up
as well the most ridiculous M&M video I saw this two days ago and it was so
contrived so cringe worthy so fake so middle schoolers trying to act like
hip-hop people so fake by a guy with hundreds of millions of dollars but
he's authentic he's got a couple black guys standing behind him and some old
cars the guy flies around in helicopters and his brand new Ferraris it's such
bad hip-hop that I didn't ever attack it but Millie Weaver did and it's got
millions of views on Facebook and YouTube since last night our reporter her
and her teammate Gavin Winston a great job that's coming up M&M is a complete
idiot is the name of the video and Paul Joseph Watson has another big report M&M
is a complete idiot so both those who coming up because it's even more
hilarious with the unintentional comedy with Keith Oberman the failed TV host
coming out saying this is the best political statement ever this is the
best music ever produced this is so incredibly wonderful
it is just the greatest unintentional comedy that you will ever see in your
life I mean M&M is so pathetic and he is emblematic of the entire fake Hollywood
rock star hip-hop red carpet system that everyone is so sick of and his records
are tanking everything he's doing is just absolutely falling apart it is
nothing but a huge delicious joke on them and it gets even better then coming
up we have the NFL stars coming out saying we're going to still go to a knee
and we're going to rebel and we're going to stand up because we don't like
America and you know what that's great because that will extinct your pathetic
disgusting league even faster let's now become an anti-American weapon by the
globalist to destroy this country so just just squeeze even tighter trying to
force us into submission and we're going to be exposing all of that in a big
big big way also ring of fire volcanoes remind Asia of seismic peril as even the
USGS says that the super volcano of Yellowstone may go off sooner rather
than later sooner than they thought then the big news is coming up
World War three Korea claims Trump has lit the wick of war threatens hail of
fire Trump responds by coming out and pointing out on Hannity that his fire
and fury comment and of course obviously his call for the storm comment does
reflect North Korea as US bombers fly over Korean Peninsula in latest show of
force and as a US helicopter apparently may have been shot down on the DMZ just
yesterday so that's coming up meanwhile conservative leaders urge Mitch
McConnell to resign because he's a neocon flathrag and we have new study
finds Democrats moving left driving growing partisan gap yes they're getting
more radical more pathetic no they're just less disciplined telling us what
America haters they always were and then yesterday Anderson Cooper told one of
the biggest whoppers of a career filled with mega whoppers and faking locations
with blue screens and green screens with chroma keys he said I am a liar and
congressman is a liar and vice magazine has this bizarre reporter that looks
like she's been given a lobotomy I mean I'm not being mean it's just it's its
next level the weird freak show stuff left into those weren't way beyond you
know midgets and all the rest of it but now they're claiming ladies and gentlemen
that we made up that Soros was ever connected to the Nazis now that now they
also say we made up that Hitler was associated with them or Herman Göring or
Heinrich Himmler or Zeb Dietrich our and Strom or Arnold Schwarzenegger's
daddy but this is next level CNN claims Alex Jones fabricated Soros ties so
there's a 12 13 minute interviews like 12 and a half minute long full 60 minutes
interview and Soros is fought to the nail to have it removed they always claim
copyright no it's fair use you guys are saying it doesn't exist every time we
try to put it up they try to take it down I'm Aaron the whole thing and I'm an
Eric Serbs of it I'm gonna shove it down your dirty throats you got a Nazi
collaborator running around in front everybody doing whatever he wants trying
to destroy the country trying to start a race war and then he wants to have his
spokespeople say I'm a liar on CNN when we've got him smiling and saying he's
proud of working for the Nazis and that if he didn't do it quote somebody else
would have you guys got a lot of nerve you got a lot of nerve so you just get
ready to have that crammed down your dirty Nazi throat by the way that makes
CNN Nazi collaborators they're protecting one of the oldest living
Nazis that helps send thousands to their deaths after robbing them protect

waging war on corruption crashing the lies and disinformation
thank you for joining us this is the broadcast the enemy hates Hollywood the globals the pedophiles the elites the old call for our
defeat the old call for our censorship they all come against this with their
lawsuits and their lies and their fraud and their operas and their stalkers and
their disinformation but the worse it gets better it gets it's the great
animating contest of liberty and we're all right in the middle of it I'm honored
to be here with you thank you so much for joining us I have two stacks of news
that intersect together and I'm gonna hit right now Harvey Weinstein the big
news Trump has dispatched the Justice Department to investigate him fleeing the
country he has fled the country for a sex addiction facility until they've got
some nice brothels in Europe they're actually called those it's a sick joke
but they find out how to properly satisfy you that's your real problem we're
gonna get to the bottom of what you need and so he's now fled to Europe just like
Roman Polanski did who he was buddies with and of course Meryl Streep who he
thinks is God because she's such a nobody talent was twit yes she has said
he's God and she says that Roman Polanski should be let out a president in
Europe after getting away with what he did for decades and that Harvey Weinstein
is a great guy well she's been forced to now say he's a bad guy because Hollywood
doesn't have the spell over America and over the world anymore and so we've got
all that happening and we've got women that he's not denying that he's sexually
abused rape you name it coming out on Twitter they're being blocked by Twitter
famous movie stars see Twitter works for the big corporate chiefs and they want
to make sure that if one of these rape victims or somebody else tries to speak
out they can't they want a virtue signal all day about oh we love women oh we
love children let us be the guardians of culture will protect your women and
children oh yes we'll do well meanwhile during Weinstein's years Disney hired
child molester who've been convicted of brutally raping a 12-year-old boy and
was known to be a savage pedophile they hired him to direct movies with
children in them get Daniels wrote a story about that isn't that liberal Ben
Affleck asked TV host exposure breast mox disabled in resurface video he did it
on tell live television isn't that just sweet and liberal and it goes on and on
now it's hurting the Batman star and hurting the image that Batman Batman
might just be a child prodigy pervert let's leave it that but continuing
ladies and gentlemen they're trying to shut this down as fast as they can and
here's some examples of what the huge Hollywood pervert combine is up to New
York Times and YouTube collude spawn fake news bastard child in the latest
project Veritas video part two of prom to America by the way James will keep
joins us next hour live via video Skype he has them admitting that oh don't
worry we force our videos to number one even if they're not popular YouTube
suppresses conservatives and force feeds us to the public well we already do
that but it's just good to understand how the force feeding works yeah we can
have a video that has a million views as of this morning on one Facebook and that
won't trend on Facebook even one stuff with a hundred thousand do and then
we'll have videos with another million or so yesterday and that's not on
trending and they've got videos with two hundred thousand trending because it's
establishment it's force fed they tell you it's winning the race they tell you
it's popular because you trust the wisdom of the crowd you trust the five
stars when it's half a star this is how they operate this is how they do it so
that's coming up we'll discuss that next hour with James O'Keefe New York Times
and YouTube collude sparks fake news bastard child MSN a Silicon Valley
teaming up to push globalist lies of course you heard it here first Mozilla
gave a hundred thousand a secure email platform for anti-fuck to launch their
criminal operations that's all the examples of big corporate money daily
going to him again Twitter suspends Rose McGowan's account for criticizing
Weinstein and saying that he sexually assaulted her because listen Twitter is
here to protect rich billionaire sex assaulters but virtue signal that men
wearing pants or dad being dad or just having dads exist is that so we've got
that censorship Trump doubles down network licenses must be challenged like
network licenses like CNN they call that dictator behavior but meanwhile they're
the ones trying to shut us down saying we should be a national censor or a
ministry of truth that controls us MSNBC is calling for this show to be shut
down completely but when Trump says people calling for that that are un-
American the one to destroy the country and destroy the markets and lie
continually we should look at their licenses they're like oh my gosh see
because they're total hypocrites scum former ESPN reporter says she was told
not to like conservative leading tweets or she'd be fired Fox Business NFL
players says there's gonna be an uproar players are forced to stand yeah
they're down just now 17 points the last month a total it's 35 plus points this
year and if you add it all together they're down 55 points in the last four
years so just what now they've got high school cheerleaders taking a knee in the
anthem good good get rid of that too it's all unhealthy garbage it's all
becomes you know the new royalty it diverts everybody it turns into you know
the the new national religion and then they can piggyback on these things we

expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so
revolutionary today infowarstore.com
you're listening to the Alex Jones show
my understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours yes yes
went out in fact and helped in the confiscation of property from the
Jews that's right was it difficult not not not at all not at all maybe as a
child you don't you don't see the connection it created no no problem at
all no feeling of guilt no well actually funny way it's just like in markets
that if I weren't there somebody else would would be taking it away anyhow
and it was the whether I was there or not the property was being taken away so I
had no sense of guilt defending the Republic from enemies foreign and
domestic it's Alex Jones
rarely do we compare somebody to Hitler rarely do we compare somebody to the
devil but in the case of George Soros a listener sent us a sculpture in the
mail two weeks ago very nice sculpture of George Soros as the devil so I've
got it in my office think I'm gonna move it out of there though it's a little bit
creepy because he went on a 13 minute segment in 1998 of 60 minutes and said
that he was proud of being a Nazi collaborator essentially now starting
about six seven years ago they would always ban the interview on YouTube we
had copyright strikes but I challenged YouTube filed the paperwork and said I
will sue in court over this so they withdrew the strike on our account but
would not let us upload it they've got computer bots that can recognize it by
keyword but also just by the video and not let us do it now we've learned how
to get around them by slowing the audio down speeding it up putting other video
over it and scrambling it that's the only way you're able to actually get the
video and it's it's subtle when you're watching but we haven't edited it for
content we've just edited it so that we can get around the bots that's what we
do here remember back when we had the Google bomb per a year and a half and we
can have the keyword every day they changed the whole algorithm to block
that we weren't gaming the system we had enough listeners to go search a term and
back then they weren't gaming it as much so you could actually have the top term
if you know a million of our listeners would go and put in a keyword we could
do it any time we wanted to boy that got their attention but what's amazing is
that CNN would have the nerve to come out yesterday and say that I am a liar
Rob do just brought in the sculpture please thank you didn't ask for it but
it's perfect timing thank the listener that sent this to us it's Ellie Hasselman
Eli Hasselman now that said imagine CNN when it's known for 19 years that George
Soros from from from 14s when he started to 17 would fair it in because the Jews
would trust him he was a young Jew just like child molesters use teenagers
lure kids they think oh we can let him know our hidden place and they gave money
and stuff he'd bring them food then he'd find out what they had he'd sell them
out they'd get rounded up he was a Judas go Jew they would send in to find the
hidden Jews to find folks like and Frank that's why he's a hero of liberal Jews
and a hero of the ADL they give him the highest award and a hero of the left
because he's the greatest living Nazi collaborator that we they're still
around you know it doesn't make sense these are really twisted sick people the
left folks they're really into evil they think it's cool and it's a better joke
for them to know he's a Nazi and funds their main operations and has
overthrown all these other countries and had nothing but an evil history after
overthrowing Ukraine overthrowing many nations the Middle East with the
Arab Spring putting the radical Muslims in that enslaved the women throw the
gaze off buildings blow up the churches this is a very very sick ruthless guy
but he's their bad guy hero that's why in the last James Bond movie it's based
on him and the quantum group as the main group funding specter funding both
sides of ever major war British intelligence help write the script they
admit that's George Soros and the quantum group is the name of his main
fund so he's a literal James Bond villain and Anderson Cooper of the
Central Intelligence Agency that's admitted went on television and said
that we made all this up and that we made it up but some of the leadership of
the so-called new right turns out to actually work for the Democrats so here
is a clip from Anderson Cooper going beyond any level of fake news ever seen
before he is going where no man has dared to go before here it is as
disgusting as both rallies were there is something else that caught our eye when
it posted this past Friday it's the claim that the the August protest the one
that killed Ms. Hire was some sort of left-wing plot now who he might ask
would say something so offensive and disgusting is that some shock-jock
radio personality maybe no an elected representative who's serving right now
in the U.S. Congress here he is two-term Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar now
he's exact here's exactly what the congressman said to Vice News
correspondent L.A. Reeve let's look at the person that actually started the
rally it's come to our attention that this is a person from Occupy Wall Street
that was an Obama sympathizer so wait a minute be careful over which area you
start taking these people to and look at the background George Soros is one of
those people that actually helps you know back these individuals who is he
I think he's from Hungary I think he was Jewish and I think he turned in his own
people to the Nazis we bear with care careful over where we go with those do
you think George Soros funded the neo-nazis who marched in Charleston wouldn't it be
interesting to find out again that was Republican Arizona
Congressman Paul Gosar this man keeping him honest does he have proof no
nothing in other words it's a false flag he's spreading and insulting and
disgusting conspiracy theory when it was swiftly Cooper it turns out all three
leaders you've had two of them on of the Charlottesville unite the right rally
we're Democrats just a year ago and have all this financing so you're saying
it's a disgusting line no it's not it's a fact but you don't even show any proof
we're lying you just say we're lying but now he tells the whopper that I made up
that Soros was a Nazi collaborator here it is by many we asked Congressman Gosar
to come on the program tonight his office declined we told them it's an open
invitation we got no reply these conspiracy theories were first spread by
radio talk show host Alex Jones the rally in August was organized by Jason
Kessler who said he voted for President Obama and attended one occupy event but
he also says he became disenchanted with the Obama administration and in addition
to organizing that hatefield Charlottesville rally has according to
vice news spent time on YouTube rallying against what he called white
genocide is certainly a charmer as for a billionaire investor George Soros who
does back liberal causes a spokeswoman for his foundation issued a statement
device news that reads in part quote George Soros survived the Nazi occupation
of Hungary and he has spent his life supporting efforts to ensure that such
terrifying authoritarianism never takes root again he was 14 years old when the
war ended he did not collaborate with the Nazis he did not help round up people
he did not confiscate anybody's property joining me now is Ellie Reeve she's the
vice news reporter who did that interview with Congressman Gosar and who was
also at the original rally Charlottesville did such amazing right that's good so
there you go ladies and gentlemen that's the type of garbage they engage in they
go on to blame me and the rest of it so here's the headline CNN claims Alex Jones
fabricated Soros Nazi ties but then we have the whole 12 and a half minute
interview from 60 minutes posted in the article where he goes into how he helped
round the people up and I just played the clip earlier later in the
transmission today I'm gonna air the entire 60 minutes piece for you so you
can see it unedited for yourself but then we upload it to YouTube or Facebook I
don't really think we're gonna scramble it to get around the box I think this is
where I should follow suit if they want to say I'm a liar and he didn't do this
interview and it's clearly fair he used to have a right to expose what this
public figure did and they try to claim that I don't have a right to show you
what he said but then say I'm a liar then I think under the first amendment
we've got a lawsuit we're gonna win and I don't want to sue people but man
they're censoring us more and more so they can build a straw man and say
things we never said and then not let us show you what we really said and I'm
getting tired of it but again it's not about info wars it's about truth tellers
and if you're a truth tellers these people come after you and they want to
shut you up because they're a pack of liars shame on Anderson Cooper and all
these people for being collaborators with a real Nazi wow James Madison the
father of the Bill of Rights wrote we're an excess of power prevails property of
no sort is duly respected no man is safe in his opinions in his person in his
faculties or in his possessions is there any question that we have an excess of
power in Washington the only question is how do we contain it and how do we
remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual that
is the ultimate concern the concentration of power the excess of
power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country it was why
the anti-fiddle is to pose the Constitution they believe they put
safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power but as James
Madison also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who
mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge
gives arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing of what
the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage to
nullify their actions for info wars dot com I'm David Knight enjoy all natural

big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones ladies
and gentlemen
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls step right up you're about to see some of
the most unintentionally ridiculous hilarious gut-busting comedy in the
world you're gonna see a man who made up the fact that he grew up hard in the
slums of Detroit who poses that he's this tough guy when he's the creation of
Hollywood and MTV producers you're gonna see him in a parking garage with a
bunch of black guys behind him because he's so authentic and so hard laying out
these devastating fierce as the CNN and ABC and NBC news all said fierce M&M and
then every old fossil Hollywood leftist globalist came out and said hey daddy oh
radical man want to smoke some reefer wow we're really cutting edge kids look
M&M doesn't like Trump wow he drew a line in the sand like it was the Alamo
and he's wearing a hoodie and he's got some old cars back there this dude's
hard I saw this two days ago and it was so bad so cringe-worthy that I could not
play it on air I mean you talk about these snot-nosed Hollywood NFL people
all of it just keep it up M&M is off the charts bad no one's listening no one's
buying his crap everyone hates him now that's what all the reviews are saying
in the real world he is a failed puppet of the globalist the NFL players are
threatened to take a knee again please keep digging that hole it's over you've
already lost half your audience the last few years keep it up keep it up we love
it but the failed sports broadcaster who failed at news now works at the failed
propped up GQ which means super uncool Keith Oberman has come out and said
after 27 years of doubts about rap I am now an M&M fan best political writing
of the year period whoo I mean this is a bunch of when I say old I don't mean
they're old people I mean old establishment folks reading off
teleprompters trying to act cutting edge burning down globalism's cutting
edge Americana has always been cutting edge you are a bunch of globalists that
took over Hollywood and our media trying to use it to force down political
control on us and it ain't working you are losers you are jokes you're losing
every special election the neocons the Republican Party establishment their
days are numbered it's all happening you are so sick and and it's the rediscovering
of America Alexander de Tocqueville the French historian wrote shortly after
Revolutionary War he traveled through the Americas and he just talked he
traveled all over the known world and he said Americans hate establishment they
hate elitism they hate posers they hate people that were given what they had they
love individualism whether you be some rich guy that did what you did or you be
some poor guy that can fight hard or somebody that can invent something and
they wanted people that were honorable and did what they said that was America
not that we were perfect but we were about over cloning overthrowing the real
class structure for freedom communism's the opposite and that's why they hate
this country so much is because we are the sexiest thing we are the Renaissance
we are freedom we are why all these people can come here and have such a
creative thing that thousands of football players can be paid five ten
million dollars a year and bitch about it but I have the right to walk and no
longer watch you and you'll see who the boss is we the people the average folks
of every color and every creed that are of one race with red blood the human
race and America isn't perfect but we recognize an offshore globalist attempt
to turn us against each other and make us hate our country so we can be conquered
and we recognize mercenaries trying to pimp us out like that little bitch
Eminem and his little wannabe thug pansies behind him who aren't real men
who wouldn't take on the globalists like Donald Trump or anybody else and I
know all the anti-military stuff blew up their face so they say this pro-America
thing at the end but that's just to sucker you so Eminem's up there doing
the hand sound is gonna cut somebody's head off Eminem you're not gonna do
nothing you little wimp punk you nobody you little coward owned by a bunch of
people like Weinstein you're riding on the tip of his you know what you're a
little bitch excuse me I'm gonna stop right now I haven't violated any FCC
rules now let's play Millie Weaver's piece that is super powerful going
super viral put it up on screen a million views just this last night when
they put it up on Facebook there it is right there million views on Facebook and
each 50 million views to put this traitor who hates America completely
finally in his dirty little cowardly thug place you want to get in a man's
world of politics now big boy you are you thug piece of crap here he is
well the BET Hip Hop Awards air tonight rapper Eminem use the opportunity to let
the world know what he thinks about President Trump listen wait how was I
gonna start this off wait what did Hillary Clinton tell me to say again
Millie did a great job back it up 10 seconds I love the fake voice wait
what's that I was gonna say let me act like I'm black what's going on I'm
Eminem I mean it's just it's so just look at this clown and he looks like he
took a dump in his pants too I mean just trying to act like he's hard on the
street and look at all this stuff I mean just this is a joke listen to this
person this is pathetic just look at this worm just look at him play it was
not gonna start this off wait what did Hillary Clinton tell me to say again
that's an awfully hot coffee pot should I drop it on Donald Trump probably not
but that's all I got you're talking all this trash on Trump man we all know
you're just another Illuminati chump got a plan and now I gotta hatch it like a
damn Apache woulda time a hawk Eminem you think you're woke but you're really
just a joke your freestyle raps man they sound like crap yeah and my raps they
don't sound that good but at least I'm not pretending I'm from the hood I'm
gonna walk inside a mosque on Ramadan and say a prayer oh so now you want to
talk about prayer mr. Satanic Illuminati jihadi she gets a map I'ma stop well
obviously Eminem didn't take his brain for us today info war store.com we
better give Obama props give Obama props for what Benghazi fast and furious and
you can keep your doctor you can keep your health care plant oh wait not
intensity's heightened tensions are rising Trump when it comes to giving this
your stingy as I am yeah you may be stingy Eminem but Trump gave over a
million dollars of his own money to the victims of Hurricane Harvey put up or
shut up it's like we take a step forwards than backwards but this is his
form of distraction I went to this late I'm gonna come back to the next segment
I'm gonna play it without my commentary but but let me just add this right now
Trump with the basic policies of cutting regulations and bringing back cheap
electricity we've seen four trillion the stock market four hundred plus billion
in new jobs one point six million new jobs three point one percent growth rate
they never said we see again in America says we were over 69% reduction
illegals coming across the border thousands of new factories moving back
to the United States the highest numbers in new factories and and wage
increases in modern history just everything and that's what them trying
to raise interest rates to block it so you're saying Trump stingy when his
hotels and his golf courses for the first time are hurting and they're coming
after him and his whole family and he's given up hundreds of millions of
dollars of his own money and got his pageants canceled and everything and
then you sit there and say he's stingy like you because I know in fake thug
culture it's cool to be hard and be stingy and not take care of people around
you I understand that so again to watch another fake gangster thug pose as if
he's political read off a teleprompter and do a terrible job and then watch a
bunch of political whores from overmen to you name it act like this is the
greatest performance they've ever seen in their lives it just shows you how
hollow and desperate and empty these people are and it is the greatest
unintentional comedy you or I will probably ever see in our lives to watch
this scum fall their face we're gonna come back that little five minute no man's
land play this whole report but please share it I just retweeted it out at real

the world know what he thinks about President Trump listen wait how was I
gonna start this huh wait what did Hillary Clinton tell me to say again
that's an awfully hot coffee pot should I drop it on Donald Trump probably not
but that's all I got you're talking all this trash on Trump man we all know
you're just another Illuminati chump got a plan and now I gotta hatch it like a
damn Apache would a Tomahawk Eminem you think you're woke but you're really just
a joke your freestyle raps man they sound like crap yeah and my raps they

you're stingy as I am liar yeah you may be stingy Eminem but Trump gave over a
million dollars of his own money to the victims of Hurricane Harvey put up or
shut up it's like we take a step forwards than backwards but this is his form of
distraction plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL they're
kneeling for our flag you imagine how pathetic Eminem is while they're
benefiting from the lifestyles that these fallen soldiers never had so we
focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico actually Puerto Rico got caught
withholding so that idiots like you could go out and scold him and says he
wants to lower our taxes then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips back
and forth with his family was golf resort to this man he slandered yeah
Trump called out the Clinton Foundation from stealing money from the Haiti
nation but you don't want to talk about that in your little wrap then does it
more from his endorsement of banning support for the Klansman the only KK
Klansman is Hillary Clinton kissing all up on Senator Bird she needs to get her
mouth cleaned forking a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa who keeps
ignoring our past historical deplorable factors I'm sorry Eminem you want to talk
about racism and bigotry and all this holier-than-thou virtue signalling
crap coming from the guy who talks about murdering raping and killing women
regularly in music videos shut up this is for calling ball up a fist and keep
that ball calling compatriots talking all this trash he's gonna get rid of
all immigrants I don't feel no ways tired he's gonna build that thing up
taller miss build the wall build the wall build that wall yeah then he's act
southerners he's a bigot mine who's a supporter of his I'm drawing in the sand
a line we see it so either for against newsflash Eminem there's already been a
line drawn in the sand and you know what you're standing on the side with all
the globalist and rich celebrity elitist and if you can't decide who you
like more in your split on who you should stand beside I'll do it for you
with this and by the looks of your album sales it's apparent that the
American people have already done this
military we love our country sold out sell out so get the hell out Americans
don't care about another whining celebrity millionaire all the King's
horses and all the Kingsmen couldn't put together little baby Eminem again

from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
for the next 30 minutes he's with us the model of a true on-the-ground but also
in the research investigative journalist James O'Keeffe the guy with this team
that brought down the organized crime syndicate Acorn the undoubtedly helped
defeat Hillary in 2016 joins us and I think it's just better if he leads us
through this because part one was powerful but that's what got all the
news yesterday on Drudge and hundreds of newspapers and we're gonna play part
one he's gonna walk through but part two is really powerful in a cashless world
we're also gonna get into some of those reports that coming up his view on what's
happened in Puerto Rico and other areas but we've got a big report out here how
the New York Times and YouTube collusion spawns fake news bastard child with his
undercover journalist there with these New York Times high-level operatives
bragging oh it doesn't matter if folks don't want to see our stuff we just force
feed it and then block all their stuff that's why we can have videos every day
they get a million views in one day and then I go to the most viewed there'll be
something with 200,000 views in the in the trending or most viewed and I'm
like it's three days all this because their force feeding it during the
campaign see a Hillary speech with 10,000 views they'd say trending but then
you'd see some other video with 10 million views in two days wouldn't be
there so that's part two of what James O'Keefe has discovered to show the covert
massive discrimination and censorship that's going on plus all the admissions
that are now happening Twitter is censoring women who Weinstein has
apologized to but who are saying he raped so now women movie stars if they
criticize Hollywood are being blocked James O'Keefe I tell you I see this is a
major sign of desperation aren't they jump in the shark here with the
Streisand effect well yeah I think so Alex the YouTube platform says quote we
believe everyone should have a chance to be discovered that we to build a
business and succeed on their own terms and that people not gatekeepers decide
what's popular but according to this New York Times editor we caught on tape as
well as his buddies at YouTube we actually have an employee at YouTube on
hidden camera admitting this the first time any journalist anywhere has taken
hidden cameras inside the Silicon Valley bigwigs this YouTube guy says that they
determine what's legitimate and illegitimate news and they specifically
call out you Alex they say that at the very least in our news carousel the top
of YouTube that they can determine which news partners are legitimate and he says
if at that point quote somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go
find Alex Jones well they were looking for him to begin with anyway
unquote which direction directly violates YouTube's mission statement now we
finally have proved that there's a sort of conspiracy a sort of collusion
between these mainstream media players and the Silicon Valley giants against
the interests of truth against the interests of the so-called non-human
intervention algorithms and obviously it's just the tip of the iceberg so
you've got New York Times CNN YouTube I know you've got a lot more coming and
as you said on the show you told me we're coming two years ago you said
we're working with former CIA on classic legal tactics to infiltrate them aka a
good-looking women here I guess in some cases good-looking guys but all I got to
say is buddy you've reached a new milestone not even government agencies
have done as good a job as the team you've assembled so I know you don't
want credit yourself but listeners need to understand thank you so much for what
you've done for freedom not just America and thank you for what you've done for my
four children James O'Keeffe well thank you Alex I appreciate that I do think it's
just the tip of the iceberg I think we got we have more videos coming but we're
gonna roll them out slowly this is a New York Times editor who's responsible for
all their videos they would to call the audience strategy editor at the New York
Times it wasn't just beautiful women we had men who had built relationships when
I say that I mean just building confidence with the people inside
YouTube and over a series of meetings they talk about the relationships on the
platform they talk about the gatekeepers and then they can arbitrarily
determine what news people see and and and there have been some reporting about
this news carousel on YouTube but no one knew that there was a human component
there was a sort of arbitrary human component blocking it out it's funny
that they call you out by name this Ernie Petty guy at YouTube his name is Ernie
and he says and he's wearing a black lives matter sweatshirt with Google on
the sleeve and he specifically says this is one of the meetings you're seeing
right here but there's another meeting where he's wearing something else he
specifically says he tries to help lack lives matters why why that there's
someone at YouTube trying to promote one agenda but not some other news source
is beyond me and I and I hope that when the New York Times has responded Alex
this is the managing editor of the New York Times said this reporter quote
violated their ethical guidelines we don't know whether that means they're
gonna fire this New York Times editor or they're gonna promote him but the
main argument that everyone always says is that the New York Times does not have
a political agenda that's what they say the difference between people like us
and them is when the truth is they that their agenda far exceeds the agenda of
the citizen journalist well look when I get in my gym in my garage and turn on
YouTube it's all leftist globalist crap and then your stuff my stuff it's
nowhere there even though I'm actually watching that used to just a few years
ago it would put that in my top feed knowing I wanted it it now blocks that
when I turn on my iPhone I get fed Huffington Post CNN used to maybe a
little Fox News no zero no Breitbart no info wars no project very toss no
drugs reports so it's everywhere they're forced feeding their garbage since you
mentioned this YouTube individual tell us a little bit about him we're gonna play
this clip so this guy's name is Ernie Petty he works at YouTube he's responsible
for I guess the brand and strategy he works with partners inside mainstream
media companies this is another thing that no one I guess is reported on that
they're there Huffington Post New York Times are specifically mentioned by by
Petty as mainstream partners that he collaborates with to make their content
the ones that show up as legitimate news and to hurt people like you he
specifically he talks about you and he says that in some cases we can make
browsers have to manually go to this other news even if it's very successful
he also talks about changing the algorithms he says that there has to be
some human intervention to make up for it to compensate for things that they
don't they think should be trending but are not notice what we're missing here
the total arrogance that politically globally freedom is exploding sensors are
in trouble the NFL Hollywood they're all imploding the censorship isn't working
here is the YouTube New York Times interface here he is laying out how
they run the Ministry of Truth aka Winston Smith 1984 for real 2017
Allah James O'Keefe and project veritas that's what that news carousel kind of does so like it's above the search results so that's a very least we can say that like this shelter videos is legitimate news because we know that these are legitimate news organizations and at that point somebody decides
the way to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones well they were looking for him
let's be about that algorithms control YouTube but according to Petty his team
has the power to shape those algorithms for Nick Dudek and the New York Times this
connection is invaluable because probably like one of the
people I think who has more knowledge about YouTube as a platform and power to play from what
we've heard Dudek has more than just knowledge of YouTube he has access we
wondered what exactly does a friendship with Petty by the New York Times there
are things that exist in the product that like they're like are definitely
optimized for news like we have a news channel page that features stop right
everyone to break them back with James O'Keefe but more talk with James O'Keefe
about this project veritas fame on the other side but here's the key for me
under classic racketeering laws of the Civil Rights Act if you have a
Christians have to bake a cake for gay folks which I do anyways my free market
guy then they're telling us as libertarians or conservatives they put a
prior constraint on us to where we get discriminated against and can't use the
bathroom or go to the soup kitchen or set at the back of the bus in fact we

American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our
own lives and decisions we do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make
up for our own mistakes neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how
to live so long as we aren't infringing on their rights freedom to make bad
decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones if we are only free to
make good decisions then we are not really free liberty is lost through
complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome
automobile checkpoints random searches mandatory identification cards and
paramilitary police in our streets we have lost a vital part of our American
heritage America was born of protests revolution and mistrust of government
subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
I want listeners to understand something in the nine minutes we have left
with James O'Keefe project very tough we have the individual from the New York
Times Liaisoning with the YouTube executives bragging how they censor
conservative pro-america pro-military pro-common sense pro-christian stuff
that exposes radical Islam that's all being censored the exposed black lives
matter people saying kill cops that gets blocked I mean this is the radicals
they've hired to run this and then Mozilla just today gave a hundred thousand
to Antifa and let them have access to their main servers and their systems to
set up this big rebellion group to start basically a civil war November 4th you
cannot make this up so Google last time I checked just gave 10 million this year
to black lives matter alone these are their brown shirt foot soldiers to not
just beat us up on the street but to also control things in cyberspace which is
illegal it's racketeering it's discriminatory it violates so many laws to
have them and we know they're doing it but to then get them on tape because I've
been looking at suing them because I have to because they're blocking us
everywhere and so we if that's all we have fighting back it's non-physical so
it's one of the few things left to us having a video like this is invaluable
that's why I said I think I'm gonna give a donation if I am I'm giving $20,000
a project for her toss today get the accountant over here I want to sign the
check he'll be gone but I want to sign it on-air because everybody needs to do
this we're in this together folks James O'Keefe I'm not kidding this is so
valuable what you're doing just to freedom these people are so authoritarian
they're so arrogant that they think they're gonna beat us I think we're
gonna win so this eight minutes we have left or seven minutes finish up the
key points folks need to know because there's hours of these videos you have
thank you Alex and I really appreciate that it means a lot that that will hire
another undercover journalist for a long time to help I let me just go over what
we've exposed here so that your audience knows what's happening this is an a guy
at YouTube who's quote brand and diversity curation at YouTube this is
self-described his name is Ernie Petty he quote works on the team that provides
human inputs into a lot of the machinery at YouTube this is what he says the so
called news carousel these are the trending videos about news Alex you're a
news provider this isn't people this isn't real voting basically it's a fake
election your vote doesn't matter now this guy sits there in the sides right
he's he's one of the few people at YouTube that actually is part of this
sort of so-called human human inputs he calls it where he adjusts that the the
way the videos are seen and by the way YouTube is one of the last places that
people like me can actually go publish our information it's owned by Google this
guy Ernie is sitting at the at the table wearing a black lives matter sweater
with Google emblazoned on the sleeve and he's talking about the relationships he
has with people at Huffington Post New York Times and Black Lives Matter and
how he gives preferential treatment to these news companies as opposed to
citizen journalists like you and I this New York Times reporter he's referring to
his name is Nick Dutic he's the subject of the first video that we did there's
the sweater sweater that says black lives matter on it with Google on the
sleeve and and he's talking about this relationship with Nick Dutic in the
first video we released this is an unbelievable video the New York Times
reporter says that he is targeting Trump's businesses he's trying to boycott
Trump's businesses he brings information to the front of the New York Times's
pages that are more negative when it comes to classic racketeering classic
stalking right and well the New York Times is publicly the videos are so
serious that the managing editor of the deputy managing at our gun in Clifford
Levy who works in the New York Times said quote the the employee violated our
ethical standards and quote we are reviewing the situation now that this
video is so big that the New York Times is condemning the activities of the
employee we're wondering whether that means they're going to give him a
promotion or whether they're gonna fire him we can tell you that there's more
videos coming and and and the New York Times has an ethical policy that says
you can't do anything to compromise your neutrality so of course the New York
Times does have a political agenda that doesn't surprise you it doesn't
surprise the people watching this program but you've got a video but you
got a video is one thing out yeah absolutely keep going so so what I
need you guys to do it I do have an action item this Clifford Levy guy is
his Twitter is Clifford Levy that's Clifford Levy why and he has already
responded but we don't know the status of this employee at the New York Times
his editor is we don't know whether he's been suspended whether he's been
fired we need you to tweet at Clifford Levy and ask him there there's the
there's the comment we need to ask him what is the status of these people
working with YouTube employees to to ban people they don't like to ban ideas
they don't like that's obviously not that's a violation and then to terrorize
Trump's businesses and brag about it right and brag about doing so and also
what is the status of this YouTube employee who's on tape Alex he's
specifically calling you out he says that we determine what's legitimate and
what's illegitimate and that's dangerous that know that that's not YouTube's job
to determine let me ask you this don't they get the Streisand effect like like
they've been caught at the White House when it was Obama and people talking
about you and shutting you down that shot you up there even more or trying to
shut me down don't they get that yes we're getting hit by the censorship but
we're still growing despite it because people go wow this must be really
important yeah I mean they I don't think they understand that I don't think they
they they realize they're not gonna change their behavior because it's the
virtuous thing to do they're not gonna stop doing this immoral this is don't
take my word for it he says the violation of their own ethics the managing
editor of the New York Times has responded to us he said that they are
violating their ethical policies but they're not gonna clean up their act
because they're doing wrong things they're only gonna clean up their act if
we light it if we shine a light on the cockroaches and this is just the tip of
the iceberg Alex we want them to say it's an isolated incident they said it
was just a junior position doing this we hope that they say these things because
Alex what's coming next is a much higher level editor who's also admitting to a
political agenda and it's a very systemic thing the difference between us
and them they say is that we have a political agenda and they don't but we
are exposing that lie for what it is well I mean we got documents months ago
that Google admitted were real where they hired a company for over a million
dollars to go around with real people voting us down so they do it in the
algorithm they hired outside PR companies have thousands of people go vote us
down I mean this is just insane it's over the top yeah I mean it's insane but
that's the power of every time I go on your show I say this is we confirm
suspicions at Veritas it's not a shock to you but to get the employee at YouTube
on tape admitting that they do it I mean you must be a threat if they call you
out by name they didn't call out Fox News by name they didn't call out anyone
else by name they said when it comes to Alex Jones we need people to scroll and
manually find him and manually have to find that video we're not we're not gonna
allow that video if it gets 10 million views to be on the front of the so-called
news carousel and we work with the Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter
in the New York Times these people Nick Dudek is either a serial liar or he has
one of the biggest conflicts of interest in the history of the world because he
says in this video these James Comey's godson and that nobody knows that he's
either lying about it or he's under some type of psychosis these are the types of
people that that YouTube's working with exactly listen James you're a hard
guy to get on but when I said I'm doing the 20,000 that's not me doing you a
favor you've done me a favor this is what we need I'm looking at spending
millions on real suits to go after them that's what a real suit would take
three-year battle with Google so 20,000 of you this is gonna help our suits
hugely so please I know you're really busy but come back the next few days to
give us an update as more comes out please we'll do we'll do absolutely okay
watch I gotta go James okay project veritas.com I am making that donation
because he's got all of us a favorite no everybody should well we'll be back
talking about the aftermath thank you James for disaster and societal unrest
has now gone so mainstream that even realtor.com is writing about it but
the realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set
themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis's guns and canned foods
militia vision of preparedness well the ants may have the last laugh on the
grasshoppers but the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make
money but maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop
another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof
bunker there are still very effective low-tech low-cost things you can do to
prepare in fact even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing
anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
we now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the
resistance it's Alex Jones what I tell you after President Trump we are the
number one target of the globalist it's not bragging many respects I'm
whistling past the graveyard I would have it any other way in fact my greatest
possession in my life it's my children I don't possess their free souls they're
the most important thing in my life my greatest Laurel not a red carpet it's
not stupid Hollywood glitter bugs thinking I'm cool God I'd hate that it's
who my enemies are I like it like it I'm gonna ran heads with another bunch of
potbellied pedophile devil worshipers come and I'm not scared of them I'm not
scared of what they do to me or anybody else because I'm gonna run them over and
if I get destroyed in the process that's the way it is I get off work early that
way I'm not afraid to die I don't want to die I got flesh I like living I like
eating I like having a normal life but I'm not a little bunch devil worshipers
run my life they want to kill me build their hand that's what they can't stand
is I'm not afraid to die it's not some macho expression it's the opposite it's
knowing how bad they are I don't want to be with them in fact I'm fearless
because I fear being with them fear drives me into fearlessness
can you imagine groveling at the feet of a big fat pedophile in Hollywood you
know it's coming out the British Prime Minister of ten years after we told you
slit little girls throats you think I'm just gonna say that we don't have
sources you think I could get up here on air in this universe and speak things
that evil people can barely get away with and say them publicly and not be
destroyed if it was a lie I've not been destroyed because it's the truth and I'm
willing to die to key alchemy there you got to have the truth and you got to be
willing to die and lose everything you got and only then can you go through the
fire and believe me if this amount of pressure been put on me 22 years ago when
I first went on air I couldn't handle it now I have seen God's design through
not just me but countless other people preparing everybody incrementally for the
weight that can be put on us so that when we get to that point of real face to
face contest with the enemy which we've now reached we're ready no longer the
learner but now the master and of course the master knows that he's a learner the
learner believes he's already the master that's why you see project veritas
there with the New York Times main liaison to YouTube and you know I had
private agreements with YouTube and I don't violate private agreements but I've
talked about this before as far as I can go
YouTube told me leave us alone and we'll make you number one did you just think
that was me trying to sound big on here Facebook told me three years ago you
leave us alone we'll let you have access to the 35 million real people that have
liked your page about the million and a half Ted Nugent it's on the air going I
used to have 27 million now it's 2 million but I know that sometimes 27
million people like my thing yeah Ted I'm member be talking the phone sometimes
I said Ted I remember seeing 22 million on there and the point is of course people
like Ted Nugent of course we're winning they're not gonna let us have the brass
ring it's it's like Joe Rogan I go on his show and he calls me the next day he
goes yeah they always uploaded they put the name up that's usually the top 20
podcasts today the numbers show it's number one on these other platforms but
they're not letting it go up it says uploaded but somebody held it and then
there was an uproar so they put it out but hit it where nobody else could see
it only people that looked and then it was still the number one podcast long
form it's something you'll five minutes long that have more that they've ever
had all total is like 40 something million last time I checked
and then of course people get the words like I just can't have you back on them
right now Alex which is fine I've got my own platform but see you think oh you'd
want the biggest podcast again right no no no no no you don't win the ND 500 in
this world and get put back on they go oh I'm sorry you can't race again you
don't score the touchdown in the Super Bowl you get fired for that you don't
win and dominate and get put forward in America under the globalist control if
you're not going along with their whole game of course that's true but it's
invaluable because in court I can get into stuff that I told YouTube I wouldn't
talk about publicly and you don't just think I recorded Megan Kelly and by
recorded I just have the emails they put us in touch with a vice president of
YouTube all this stuff work with us but just be nice Alex and then when I
wasn't nice they said well you saw what you could do we unleashed you for a while
we're gonna put you back on a leash so same thing people like hey you being
nice to Facebook and we're gonna let you actually have access to your fans and
it's gonna be big and you're gonna make hundreds of millions of dollars Alex but
I don't want to have access to it I'm posing as a fake conservative like Fox
News I I don't want the biggest jet on the tarmac and the best trophy wife and
walk around with a bunch of other mummies you know what half of them are
pedophiles no I don't want to have sex with ten-year-old girls no I don't want
to devil worship and decide I'm a god I do not want what you're offering I want
to squeeze your neck until your eyeballs pop out metaphysically I want to
destroy you that's what I want the globalist always asked in the past what
do you want I want to destroy you because you want to destroy me you want to
overthrow everything good you want to hurt children you want to brain damage
people you want to force fetus GMO and all the rest of garbage and you know the
fluoride in the vaccines lower IQ 30 plus points together and you're the enemy
how would I not oppose that it'd be like if I was a mouse and they said help us
feed all the other mice of a meat grinder and then we'll throw you into the
meat grinder after I'd say I'm a mouse I'm not gonna throw my other mice the
reason I use that example I'm not a mouse I'm a man mice would run from this
people say boy you're sure fight you sure got courage I folks in this running is
fighting there's no where to run we're cornered they're still getting out of
this alive unless we fight them you figure that out yet and it's that basic
human instinct that they hate that I'm not scared I'm only scared of them
when I'm only scared of rolling over I'm only scared of them standing in the way
of what our species can do together so don't ever call this show and thank me
for what I've done thank me for not wanting to see all of us fed into a
meat grinder it's not special to want to fight these people it's default it's
not something to get an award for the reward is a future for your children I
just have to cool my afterburners and not exude all of my energy now against
the enemy I've got to slowly lean up against them and strangle them and to
do that I need your prayers and support but make no mistake just as you just

you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving
this transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of FEMA
region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones again America
and the world was sleeping under the parasite of the satanic globalist
pedophile system once you awaken you'll see everything I've seen and more that's
why the enemy so scared their entire house of cards is falling we are now
gaining on them every day even though we were way behind the enemy is throwing
out every technique they can to try to drive you back into submission but it's
not working all I can tell you is as good as the awakening is the enemy's
gonna strike back in a very bloody way and I haven't gotten into this yet I'm
gonna get into it more later in the next hour and open the phones up as well you
have to understand they can compartmentalize people in the military or
in law enforcement just as much they can compartmentalize you in the company you
work in do you know what's going on in accounting do they know what's going on
in maintenance do they know what's going on in lawn care whatever it is your
main business is pool care radio TV I mean whatever it is think of the
compartmentalization in your life with your husband or your wife you're not
hiding stuff from the other one it's just that somebody handles this somebody
handles that you tried to know everything they're doing you'd spend all your
time so when we look at Vegas I'm not defending the sheriff's department or
the police or FBI but it's the FBI and local police that have given us the
truth before anybody else did that there was a lie now mainstream media
spending at the sheriff's department lied and it was police response time
that's why they lied there were shootouts all over the city there were
multiple terrorist teams the police got several of them now it's under national
security we don't know exactly what happened the people involved are trying
to figure it out but again when I get in here in an exercise of saying it's not
all the police I'm not doing that as some virtue signaling thing it's that
they're compartmentalized just like we are we knew what really happened we knew
the first questions because of local police local citizens and the FBI they
go wait a minute Alex you're saying the FBI guy over it's a bad guy we have that
from multiple federal sources some on air I'm surprised Craig Sawyer said on
air I heard the same stuff from other people he named the guy that's an Obama
creature back from the Clinton days but under Obama really got nasty so they
don't know everything they just know he had Islamic material they just know he
had anti-material they said no Alex when I kept saying she they said there was
Islamic notes in the house or in the hotel room and the she'd travel there's
like no Alex he's traveled there him to came out later a week later he traveled
there so it doesn't mean we have all the answers or I have them all it means
we're being lied to about what happened here so the casino is acting very very
suspicious right now I'm trying to blame the police and if you look at the
background of the casino and the leftist garbage the George Soros connections
Islamic connections it's not the casino that was given us tips about the being
a cover-up it was law enforcement so think about that and they're the ones
telling us there's a cover-up going on above it below Trump but above them it's
at that high-level management level right below the top people and Trump's
trying to clean it up and he's fired 13,000 people but they'll lie to his
face a lot of his managers face it's just it's a it's an infiltration this is
an infiltration war now he's been there for almost a week he just got back
last night and he's dutifully without me telling him to in here at his desk
working hard one of our most intrepid in the field reporters and investigative
journalists videographers and Michael Zimmerman's gonna be in studio riding
shotgun the whole next hour when we take your calls in another subjects but he
went to Puerto Rico they landed there and they flew to other sub areas and
they've been there and it's exactly what Trump said the island was always
infrastructure low it always had a lot of corruption you got 90 plus mayors that
tell you things they should have like for three million people most Puerto
Ricans live here what's that tell you beautiful island great culture but you
know it's like areas east Texas or something or podunk places I mean they
just it's it because it gets hit by hurricanes all the time why should you
put in a big expensive house or infrastructure they get flattened every
five years by hurricane the Caribbean's awesome folks but if you're right in
those hurricane pass it's you know it's got some issues so he's been there the
Democrats are 100% sitting on their hands 100% he's got all the video and
more let's come start the next hour I got a lot of the clips I want to get to
I've got all the cover up by the mainstream media and all these nasty
notice I singled out Matt Damon Ben Affleck George Clooney as the slimmiest of
the slimmers because I know folks that know him and I've been around them a
few times and I'm not proud of that by the way so I've been around them I
think and yeah I've been around Hollywood and I got out of it real quick I
sure went and checked it out for a few years just off and on and it rolled out
the red carpet by the way but it was not a carpet that I wanted to follow come
up you'll Tom and Jerry cartoons where the tongue goes out and it looks like a
hotel or a nightclub it's really the cat's mouth and the mouse is walking in
I was like yeah this looks like a mouth I think I'll go back to Texas my little
spidey sense is like pegged like get what are you doing get it wasn't even
fear it was like weakness it was maybe that's just Hollywood then I'd be a
few other places around the country feel great till I went into a room with them
and then I felt again like whoa this is like being in hell man my spirit is like
punishing me get away from these people but I can be in the middle of some
little poor town in Georgia fishing with some old blind man on the edge of a
river my soul feels real good but if I'm in Hollywood or anywhere around it man
my spirit tells me man this is empty this isn't like power that wants to
control you or dominate you kind of like barbaric male energy that's has a hint
of Satanism but it really isn't it's just twisted that that's an urgent gets
me excited and angry and that's the one that really tempts me the you know
conquest resistance war domination against worthy opponents but Hollywood
it's like soullessness it's emptiness it's like a betrayal it's it's pure
Satanism so that's coming up but before I go any further as you know you built
info wars and they're trying to censor us on every platform out there but we
have found ways around it I'm not going to get into how we do it I've talked
about some of it already today they want to censor us out of existence they can
say Alex Jones the liar George Soros fought the Nazis at the Battle of the
Bulls with General Patton CNN said that last night they said Soros was a
victim and battled Nazis valiantly he stood beside Captain America in the
front lines I mean they almost went that far when we had the videos of him
admitting the whole deal and I'm gonna try to play more of that next hour
CNN claims Alex Jones fabricated Soros Nazi ties that's the article you can see
the full 12 and a half minute 60 minutes where he says I'm kind of proud of

ladies and gentlemen hollywood is crumbling Babylon's falling rejoice the
hypocrisy of hollywood is on full display as the Harvey Weinstein scandal
continues to grow as more victims continue to come forward and as more
clips of hollywood stars continue to surface showing them engaging in well
shall we say similar behavior CNN calls Jimmy Kimmel America's conscience and
here's America's conscience enticing young girls into groping his crotch for
a chance to be on television this game show is called yes what's in my pants
now I've stopped something in my pants and you're allowed to feel around on the
outside of the pants you have 10 seconds to then guess what is in my pants you're
ready go you should use two hands you think is is that your final answer
wow he continues to skit with a variety of different fame horse who
are all willing to humiliate themselves for a chance to be on television which
in Los Angeles coming in almost unlimited supply one of which is so
young-looking that he's concerned that he may be breaking the law you worked on
a farm haven't you okay can you sure of that there's a uncle Jimmy doesn't need
to do time it's not gonna bite you well nothing unusual there I guess just a
late-night Hollywood talk show host who regularly uses his show to promote
Hollywood propaganda and poison the minds of billions here's Ben Affleck
who's worked very closely with Harvey Weinstein over the course of his career
on a variety of different films and apparently he's learned quite a bit from
him because here he is groping and apparently sexually harassing this
woman is trying to interview him about one of his films well I usually show a
lot more cleavage than this what's the story why are you covering it up today
by the way this is when he was dating Jennifer Lopez this is how Hollywood
people roll when they're in a relationship no wonder Hollywood marriage has
never last and then there's this guy Ed Asner who was on a show in the 1970s
called the Mary Tyler Moore show which was about a woman who decided not to
get married and not have kids but instead pursue her career a show which was
celebrated by all the liberals and the feminists as groundbreaking and here he
is on MSNBC yesterday talking about the Harvey Weinstein scandal and sexism in
Hollywood when he started the interview off by saying this at Asner wow it's
great to have you here thank you so much for coming in thank you and not even a
kiss no nothing right oh my god this is it this is okay this is totally bizarre
you're on the show talking about sexism in Hollywood and hear your pestering the
interviewer to give you a kiss that wasn't the end of the weirdness they went
on to talk about the Harvey Weinstein scandal and then he blamed President
Trump for creating a climate in the country that enables people like him and
then when they wrapped up the interview he said this at Asner the book is the
grouchy historian longtime fan thank you so much for coming on the program good
luck with the book you show me a kid okay you're gonna get yourself in trouble
and with good reason I'm not the job I'm not a job procurer thank you what an
absolute creep this guy even looks like Harvey Weinstein look at that he's got
that same one squinty eye maybe they're just both possessed by similar demons
while there are more people denouncing Harvey Weinstein every day from
Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama not everybody is ready to write him off just
yet Lindsay Lohan who is apparently not dead from a drug overdose posted this
video on her Instagram telling everybody to leave Harvey alone
Hi, this is Lindsay Lohan. Hi, I'm in Dubai. I'm home. I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now. I don't think it's right what's going on.
It's not right what's going on she says to him he's the victim here. I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now. I don't think it's right what's going on.
I think Georgina needs to take a stand and be... She lives in Dubai of course.
I've never hung with him and I was like yeah when you trump out of Islam and so I think everyone needs to solve I think it's wrong so we'll stand up.
That really is her I know it sounds like she has an accent there but that is
Lindsay Lohan apparently she's just stuck in character unable to differentiate
completely mentally from reality at this point it gets so much more disgusting I
don't even like talking about it check my previous video yesterday to see
Hollywood A-listers including Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson literally
giving a stand yeah and the idiocracy president the producers would grab his
movie who was given an Oscar we'll be back folks but couldn't accept it we'll be
back you know there's plans you like to rape old girls that's okay just a little
sets cool
police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool
called stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and
text messages without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the FBI
who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure
agreements forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology
needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment and
they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying where we
now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent
people who are not even suspected of any crimes once again more evidence that the
police state isn't coming it's already here this is Darren McBreen and I invite
you to join the resistance info wars dot-com
and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
gonna happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got
one of the information war it's Alex Jones ladies gentlemen Michael Zimmerman
just spent five six days in Puerto Rico and it wasn't at some arms resort where
they got security guards protecting it for some rich neighborhood it was in the
poorest areas riding with the 18-wheeler's going in witnessing the unions
ordering a stand down but still despite that the 20% of the truck drivers
working around the clock me I'm making hours a day have gotten 80% of the stores
and gas stations open power on the many areas and our media just keeps lying
even though we've given more aid per capita than we've given to Houston
that's 10 million people Metro to Puerto Rico is 3 million and I'm all for
helping Puerto Rico like I've talked to folks that go on vacation there it's very
low-cost very beautiful they tell me don't want to go downtown at night you'll
get mugged but other than that it's really nice country and I'm you know a
lot of Puerto Ricans are listeners of the show but we're gonna get into the
reality of what Michael Zimmerman with the great Gary Haven documented as part
of the aid relief that we supported me while Hillary robbed the Philippines and
you know robbed you know so many other countries like what happened in Haiti and
robbed other countless other nations during disasters they quote oversaw then
she shakes her fish it at her fist at Trump it's not that I'm even defending
Trump I'm defending reality so let's go ahead and go to Michael Zimmerman's
report this is Michael Zimmerman reporting for infowars.com on September
20th Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico now 20 days later the effects
of the storm are still being felt by most of the island this week I traveled
to Puerto Rico with Gary Haven and his wife Diane who had previously traveled
with Tahiti to cover the damage after Hurricane Matthew we're off to Puerto
Rico right now we're picking up a group of missionaries that need to assess the
situation they're working with over 2,000 churches there and incidentally
they're working for the White House and so we should have a really interesting
day going to the island of Vieques which is kind of isolated they say the
airport's closed but we're going there anyway so we'll find the out so let's
have a great adventure and see if we can do some good out there we traveled to San
Juan where we picked up a pastor that was working with the network of over 2,000
churches across Puerto Rico and a former US ambassador who led recovery efforts
after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti from San Juan we flew to the remote island of
Vieques home to 9,000 people in order to survey the damage and see where aid
could best be used what we saw in Vieques was similar to what we saw in the rest of
Puerto Rico there's lots of damage across the island but residents for the
most part have food and water at this point access to electricity is the main
need but not something that aid groups or individuals are able to help with the
mainstream media has spent the past 20 days attacking President Trump over his
response to the disaster blaming him for the current crisis on the island but
as info was previously reported the problem really lies with the
distribution of aid across the island here's what Colonel Michael Valle
commander of the federal relief effort in Puerto Rico had to say the aid is
getting to Puerto Rico the problem is distribution the federal government has
sent us a lot of help moving these supplies in particular fuel is the
issue right now it's the lack of drivers for the transport trucks the 18
wheelers supplies we have trucks we have however only 20% of the drivers show up
to work as a Puerto Rican what happens here for the people is personal to me
to say we are not provided all of the help and resources needed is just not
true distribution is the key and we're working day and night on it this match
is what we observed while in Puerto Rico the containers of aid are backed up at
the ports and not making it to the people here's what m4's contributor and
Puerto Rican Ruben Obed had to say who lives just 30 minutes from San Juan I'm
gonna be really honest with you and this you might not hear in the mainstream
media here in Puerto Rico there has always been an issue with truckers you
know they they sometimes they paralyze the whole country because they want
raises because they want this and that I don't know if that is what's going on or
maybe they're thinking you know let's put pressure and capitalize on this
hurricane that might be the case I personally I'm a Trump supporter and I
and I know for a fact that Trump has sent the help in a series of tweets
president Trump said they want everything to be done for them when it
should be a community effort 10,000 federal workers now on Island doing a
fantastic job despite the many issues with FEMA as we see with every
disaster Trump was right Puerto Rico depends upon the community coming
together to distribute aid while traveling around the island we saw
cars on all major freeways and stores open everywhere Democrats will continue
to blame Trump for the problems of Puerto Rico but thousands of men and
women at the National Guard FEMA and other government agencies will continue
to work around the clock to help with recovery efforts in Puerto Rico this has
been Michael Zimmerman for info wars.com you know seeing in what father
average show is about 300,000 viewers an hour nationwide and about that
internationally so 600,000 viewers it's if they put something on like you just
put on three and a half minutes long super HD video all the experts the
truth of what's happening that would have five million viewers in a show but
they just have to lie about everything and then they even have the teamsters on
video bragging oh we're holding it all up but despite that everybody just went
around them Trump signing order to bring in outside truck drivers you were there
Michael and it just shows how they jump on every opportunity to try to sabotage
the recovery and now they're trying to raise interest rates to sabotage the
economy's recovery this is really a group of terrorists absolutely and they're
not reporting the truth they've spent the past three weeks demonizing Trump
saying that he's doing nothing for these people they'll play the clip of you know
he went there he threw some paper towels into a crowd and they're like oh
that's all the relief Trump did that's not true they were yelling give it it's
exactly it was like a football game or a rock star deal he was just being
personal was having fun actually and everyone's laughing and smiling people
liking cuz he does that right we don't want some stuck-up president that you
know yeah and they're trying to make it out to be that's the only release that
he gave to the island but they're actually sending power line trucks that's
CNN Skelter said look at the relief this is all he did was paper towels they have
you were there it's stacked up to the well I showed in that that footage all
those containers throughout the ports the docks are full there's nowhere to
unload new containers because despite you know it's full of goods it's full of
relief and that was two weeks ago I was reading it's like 1520 ships lined up
to yep but they can't even dump it yeah we saw a couple ships out in the in the
harbor there in San Juan but all the ports that are federally controlled are
open on the island all the airports are open we drove on let's show that
math you mentioned to tell folks for themselves on radios we always think
we're just visual we're mainly radio tell folks I think of the official nation
of Puerto Rico Island of Puerto Rico's own site to see what's really going on
right there's this website called status dot PR let's put that on screen guys
status dot PR on this website they show all the up-to-date statistics as of
today so 79% of gas stations are open today 86% of supermarkets 55% of
telecoms back of course the big power issue is power and electricity that's
at 17% today but the power company was bankrupt there months before the storm
even hit so they don't have condition it's been bankrupt for two years the
overall name but they're they're power that's what Trump's saying he's saying
listen like Houston the citizens help everybody work with the military
everybody you got it it's not the citizens fault there they're controlled
by these liberal mafias these the like mayors are like the mafias of each
little street exactly 93 mayors and we saw young people driving around in
pickup trucks and I'm thinking the whole time we're there if there's people in
need if there's old people who are going without food or water why are you not
driving these points where they're distributing the aid with your pickup
truck yeah I mean here's the deal it's not because it's not because their color
it's it's cultural you had Hispanics and whites and blacks all help each other
in Texas that's how we do it right just get out of the way there's this
attitude the third world in Latin America just wait and go through a
bureaucracy well we went to some of these areas and right down the street
there's a whole mall open there's grocery stores open people are like where's
their food where's their water it's like well if you don't have a car you might
have to go walk to get some but it's very different than what we saw in Haiti
where if these people didn't have food delivered they died they would die how
many what hundreds of thousands 200,000 died in Haiti we got maybe 50 something
deaths 50 60 around that yeah I check you last night
57 deaths versus 200,000 from the earthquake in a right and Katrina was
over a thousand people died right here in Louisiana. See that's all teleprompter
free because we actually have a passion to care because think about you love a
cashless society there was an article out today from Mises.org it's on
infowords.com in a cashless world you better pray the power never goes out and
they're in big trouble because of that they the banks are not open and a lot
of people like Ruben Obed who we spoke to who's been on the show before he said
well we've got money on our debit cards but we can't go to the bank and get cash
and the card readers are down in the stores. I mean I don't want to sit here
and just defend Trump but it's like defending reality it's like somebody I
call it and said Jews invented devil worship and I go actually Jews were the
first group to ban human sacrifice Abraham and it's not just defending
Jews it's defending reality it's the same thing here you know it's just like
Trump did not do this he's done a great job so is our military and FEMA and
everybody else.

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming
to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars. You know about three weeks ago
I made the decision we're gonna get back to Puerto Rico in a minute it's bigger
than Puerto Rico it's about media response control manipulation you
understand Puerto Rico you understand it all it's a great case point example and
it's very important but I decided and I told the crew I said listen I don't tell
you what to cover I don't tell you what to do so I hired people that I know are
competent care about freedom I want to have their perspective the media always
says look Paul Watson disagrees with Alex on this Alex can't control his
reporters no no I don't work at the Huffington Post or Newsweek where it's
a cult I don't tell folks to agree with me they don't get in trouble for
disagreeing it's they have a general history of being smart of know what's
going on and I respect it I want that college of ideas I don't want to be
addled or hobbled by by by people being yes man that said I said look I don't
want to I've told Roger Stone this to us I don't want to follow White House
intrigue and power struggles because I said we get rid of Spicer we get rid of
previous and then we get Kelly and then Kelly's even worse supposedly and I said
I don't know what the truth is about Kelly his son died in Iraq he sounds like
a committed guy but then I hear I can't help it you know that Trump's very close
to firing Kelly and suddenly Kelly is doing a live press briefing right now
coming how much he loves Trump just the one way to not get fired by Trump so so
I just all I know is Kelly admits in the news our main jobs keeping info wars
from the president well what did Google and the New York Times say we want to
stop Alex Jones because it's not Kelly out there when they're saying that
Trump's killing everybody in Puerto Rico exposing it it's our operation it's
our audience that then helps us get the info and carries the ball we're all
you folks your info wars I don't just set a pat on the head without you we're
dying with you we win together you win so but I think it's healthy you're not
focused on the White House intrigue and I don't tell Roger what to do I'm just
giving examples I told everybody I said listen I get caught up in this too
we're not in DC we're not scrambling to be part of the power we're not all these
losers up there in DC that need to be part of that power we built this we're
America we don't want to be part of Hollywood or DC or New York or the power
structure we want to be separate and independent but that said I don't mean
never cover it but but what's your view on that Michael right I agree we shouldn't
make that the main focus they're trying to distract us right now from all these
things happening in Las Vegas to cover up with that with this news about IQ
tests and Kelly and Trump having some sort of feud that's not the main story
going on the main story is that 60 people were murdered in Las Vegas and the
story they're giving us is a bunch of lies what do you make of the info we
got up 12 days ago all of it proven right from the HRT I mean the first time
I got info from the HRT I was like okay and then it happened second time like
wow third time they're giving us what does it say about America that the FBI in
the actual tactical level communicates to us I was skeptical about some of this
when I left town a week ago last Tuesday you know I was questioning the main
story but I wasn't really sure you know where they're multiple shooters what of
the story they're giving us is true and then when I got back in town and had
internet again I was just reading article after article last night and
they admit the whole stories of fraud multiple shooters shooting 45 minutes
before notice I said two days ago but notice it's six minutes before I said
watch they're gonna expand it because what we had was there was at least four
shooters and cops took them out in other areas and we have the witnesses there
was a major ISIS attack they said there was guys with beards running around I'm
not supposed to get into this but I mean they just covered up an ISIS attack
then you gotta ask why are they doing in the hotel new six minutes before yeah
this guards getting shot their policies not to do anything about it so they
don't even tell the police we've got someone reigning gunfire out of the
window and then this whole thing saying it was these bumpfire stocks they
finally put those pictures out that's all lies there's videos out there I've
everybody we've talked to Navy SEALs Delta Force special forces green beret
they even know the names of the guns we've been hired an acoustic guys coming
out tomorrow they they have signatures they know the guns bro right and it's
not what they're telling us so where are these guns where the other shooters just
like there's voice print analysis for 20 years right they got gun analysis they
know the report how long it is even what what load they're shooting when you can
measure the the distances with the you know sound the actual gunshot and then
the sound of the bullet hitting knowing velocity since yeah it's like 250 meters
or something Gary was actually showing me a video while we were in the Dominican
Republic he found one that was analyzing all of this how cool is Gary Haven
coolest person I've ever met cooler than me I'm jelly I never get to fly on you
guys all his jets and stuff but he's always like help him he doesn't just do
it for publicity he never even wanted to I said hey let us go on your aid
missions he literally just flies around helping people once the first day we
went into into Puerto Rico we flew over the island and we're trying to find out
where could aid best be used but if the ports are open and the freeways are open
it doesn't make sense for him when his money could be used for aid in other
countries to fly things in you know on an airplane when the ports and roads are
open all the stores sure and stacked up to you know 10 boxes deep 10 containers
right literally but but you guys did go give the real age showing the truth
exactly so we distributed aid to a town right outside of San Juan and then
Rubin Obed has then gone and distributed that to a bunch of people in his
community we gave him some money since the stores are open too but he's
making good use of that because what we left the break in a cashless world you
better pray the power never goes out he's got money he's got a business he's a
successful guy he can't spend it right everyone has their money on the cell
phone the banks are down the store may be open but sorry yeah if you don't have
cash on hand you're not going to be able to spend any money so 80% of the
stores are open if you don't have any cash you're out of luck because the
stores don't have power they can't run your car and they always act like we're
against technology that we've got food or we got solar or we got a garden it's
a normal human activity ants save food grasshoppers don't they die I mean it's
like normal instinct like you know I had a new great baby total angel five months
ago and I told my wonderful wife I said listen I want you to buy even though
you've got breast milk case that stopped case it was a problem in case anything
goes on there was a major war I want you to buy a year of formula and she and she
said my milk's fine blah blah blah and you know we got I said do it well four
months in her milk stop nope no effect on her great lady and you know and it's
just examples like wow yeah now we got a year of formula right I said exactly
it's insurance we can eat it's like I want the bases covered that I can cover
in worst case if it gets towards the end of life of the storeable food which is
20 plus years on most of the stuff the stuff we saw was 25 years right yeah
it's getting close to the end of the life you know 22 23 years and you can
donate all that food to a food bank well I mean exactly but I'm sitting there
rocking a baby who's a month old and watching my wife you know nurse her I'm
thinking what if there's a nuclear war with Korea I got food for everybody else
I don't have stuff that protect the baby and then I think well what well she's
got milk I'm not gonna just count on her have a milk no and then sure enough it
ran out it happened before with other three other kids another wife but it's
just you know it's no effect on her I can't produce milk the point is that you
just look at an every angle right well and you've got to provide for people you
have to provide for your family and make sure they're taken care of and your
community too so right now those roads are open in Puerto Rico people need to
go to the stores buy food help their neighbors if your neighbors don't have
food it's up for you to help and that's my point it's not being a superhero as a
father you're analyzing at night are the are the lights on outside are the
doors locked and do I have a firearm and an instant access it's not that I'm
living in fear I'm living in charge so I lay down I feel good yep you're not
losing any sleep at night your family's taking care of you've got food for them
all that and I'm ready and I'm politically fighting for the future
not because I'm a hero but because I'm not an enemy of my family it's a default
to be involved folks and it's empowering it's the real ballgame not
one should a bunch of drug addict steroid heads out there pissing on the
flag we'll be back with more breaking news of Michaels everman I'm Alex Jones

defending reality defending the innocence not because we're heroes because we
aren't pedophiles we're not evil we're not trying to be evil we have a big
story and and Zimmerman's been looking into this it's a hit Daniels article on
news wars.com and info wars.com how did they a few years ago get hundreds of
photos of all these top models I remember when I heard it in top stars I
thought how'd they get into all of their cloud computers at once that just
doesn't make sense turns out it was the database people are fortune the
autistic army as they call themselves not an insult to plus has found the trail
that it appears to be a Weinstein cache that's on info wars.com we'll talk
about that in a moment speaking of that before we get back into this with
Michael Zimmerman riding shotgun with me fresh back from our aid trip and our
investigation of Puerto Rico the island nation hit by three hurricanes this
year before we go any further I just want to point out that the Justice
Department Trump started a criminal investigation today how sensational is
that of him fleeing like we and others pointed out yesterday I and others the
whole office did is this Polanski too where he rapes a 13-year-old girl after
kidnapping her brutally and then flees to France for years not getting in
trouble then there's pressure they grab him for other sex abuse put him in
prison at Merrill Street once he went to prison the arrogance of publicly
defending convicted child molesters why would Merrill Street now come out and
say she's against Weinstein because their powers gone the numbers show it
the facts are in the NFL mainstream news CNN of the Daily Show Comedy Central
co-bear all of it I never got up here in my 20 plus years and said they've fallen
they're done I was like they're on top of us dominating us there's come their
filth here's the alternative when I'm telling you they're done they know
they're done that's what they're trying to blow the country up trying to cause a
race war trying to try to ship AIDS infected blood all over the country from
California as they've legalized they are in full panic mode they've reached this
point where they're eating their own now everyone is going to save themselves
they're going to turn on the others the whole system they've built there with
all these pedophiles all these sex offenders abusers how luscious is it
going to be to watch it and plug oh Harvey Weinstein is the beginning it's
going to be wonderful over the next week or two we're going to see a lot more
people they're talking about been out like now because I'm not a sadist unless
it's a child molester devil or spurs killer and you know I kind of want to
watch him you know go through a lot of pain oh yeah no I those are people I
wish death on if you're gonna harm a children a child in that way there's no
excuse there's no forgiveness either well it's happening now here's a piece
that the crew put together of them sickeningly including the star of one
of the biggest films has been out lately based on the whole books that were put
out kind of showing us a near future world that they could create the hunger
games and we've got this quote star of that literally on camera groveling to
Weinstein and we've got her in the data dump of this whole situation I mean this
this whole implosion is incredible because we all know these guys are not
really into women they're not into men either the the the main or derv is small
children and so get ready for the whole house of cards to come down they're
scared folks and I'm just honored with you because believe me all of you
listening are the battering ram knocking down the gates of hell thank our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now here is Hollywood defending the man that it's
not denying he raped a bunch of women there it is don't do it you don't want
to miss what we're down oh please I'm not afraid of anyone in show business I
turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions
I mean don't have a fight with me
we come I'm not gonna do anything I swear on children please come in on
everything I'm a famous guy I'm feeling very comfortable right now please come in
now and one minute and if you want to leave when the guy comes with my check
yesterday you touched my breeze please I'm sorry just come on I'm used to that
are you used to that just stick your arm in the drainage part by thanking Harvey
Weinstein for organizing this is a wonderful human being a good friend
and just a powerhouse I just want to thank God so that's the joke is to have
a tranny as the beard for that Obama's just be public about it as a gay man the
Punisher Old Testament I guess
I just want to congratulate Harvey and his wife Georgina on the birth of their
new baby boy what's that hearts man Harvey gave us what we needed
she looks really gross think about her she's done with him now she's gross she
was a major person who's photos for anything like his dad Jennifer Lawrence
Harvey Weinstein right mate she thanked him at every award show he was on set of
movies that he didn't even produce she was in Oscars
let's just do what we're here to do oh yeah she's in deeper time
are we asking for it you know by prison all of the feminists now now women are
asking for it like the feminist mayor of Columbus said don't wave many skirts the
Muslims are gonna write you a performance by an actress in this
where don't write me bracelets congratulations you five ladies no
longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein
you put the house late time
where was she call me God it doesn't work oh my gosh called you God how
embarrassing I did later on the rapist interviews the rapist who is this
woman I don't think we're only looking at him I think you're looking at a world
much deeper than that Donna Karen I think we're looking at a world much deeper
you know they had that they tried to have the Huffington Post come out and
claimed that I was defending Weinstein when I said a lot of women know they're
getting into this and it's really evil but a lot of young women don't and so
watch out young women you may end up in snuff films which has happened in
Hollywood I mean look at Sharon Tate oh that was filmed oh we'll see I'm sorry
don't know that the point is is that that's an FBI files you're gonna call
today so how do you know that Jones this is all going on this is all happening
and the truth is a lot of women like Meryl Street reportedly who defends
child molesters like Ron Glansky they help procure the young girls just like
they'll use a woman or a child to get kids in the back of the ice cream truck
this is what people are talking about when they talk about selling your soul
for fame when you're selling your soul to make it in Hollywood they're talking
about this kind of stuff getting just passed around by these studio creeps
like Corey Feldman and others have said their children when the stuff starts
happening to them well you know Mark Dice told this story it has happened to me
too and he's in a big major TV studio they're offering me a TV show with one
of the one of the Molly crew people and I separately confirmed this I just say
the name right now and the Molly crew guy wasn't into it either and you know
they should the pettograms and stuff till you look radical but they're pitching
them both this show Mark Dice and a member of Marley crew it's about five
years ago and they tell Mark Dice when he's out of the room they go listen just
a pleasure he's just a Satan let's pray to live for right now we're giving the
show and and Mark said you know I'm a Christian but you guys like listen we
just want you to not push that Christian stuff just say it and we'll let you go
well later it came out that that's what they do to quote make sure you're not a
Christian or right wingers that no that's not what they're not just seeing
that's what they're into and I've had him say that to me like hey Alex you
really shouldn't be at this party unless you want to screw little kids and I
realized they were messing with me but they weren't I was like you know what
actually I don't want to do that so I'm not gonna be part of this so that's what
it is folks stay with us we've taken thousands of years of known research and

you're listening to the alex jones show
the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end
up on top the truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above
the world listening to the alex jones show and I hope I'm getting my heart
right with God and not be part of this collapsing to hell to clear the world is
degenerating quickly a lot of good developments as well it's it's it's a
paradox a lot of key stories up on news wars dot com and prison planet com you
just got back last night but have you seen we're seeing and says that George
Soros was fought the Nazis like Captain America I mean they had he said he helped
the Nazis and work with them on 60 minutes in 1998 now they say that's a
lie that I told what do you make of that it couldn't be more clear what Soros
said we've played that clip hundreds if not thousands of times here at m4s
Soros says that those were some of the best days of his life and then of course
everyone knows CNN is fake news at this point it's only these same people get
their news from John Oliver and Jimmy Kimmel who believe this stuff that's
right they just know they're disruptive now their job is just to get us
debating with them when they say the skies you know orange instead of blue at
noon they just want to get us debating that's their only job Trump only gave
people paper towels yeah sure I know I saw John or what's his stelter or whatever
little Humpty Dumpty got like so on there saying that with all this weird
confidence act I can't even do the look he does where he just goes like that
tries that company is I can't even do it he's such a ridiculous person I don't
know this is the best weapon they've got yeah these mainstream media jokers and
the the comedy shows that come on at night they think a late-night host or
people source in news now because a lot of morons out there believe it well
here's the problem we built a high-tech civilization the average folks worked in
factories or doctors or teachers or were farmers and we built this high-tech
civilization a bunch of crazy psychopaths thought we'll be God if we get
into this they sought power they got into positions Hollywood government now
because of internet we've all become savvy generationally and we're like who
is this creepy pervert wanting to be good saying he's God he I mean anybody
who's confident knows you're not God you're confident you're just you you
have a connection to God that's your he doesn't even have the connection he
thinks he's God and doesn't have the connection right it's like dude you're
not even don't even have a connection to God and their audience too is small
compared to that guy you had on the other week who shoots the the phantom
videos yeah he's getting 30 40 million views a lot of these students he had
70 million on one he's just a black cop it's articulate and everybody saying what
people are all right there make it yeah he's telling the truth he's going out
there and people want the truth so instead of these these movie execs who
spend hundreds of millions of dollars making a film and a lot of them are
flops this guy gets his cell phone and reaches 70 million people they wish they
could do that CNN wishes they could do that because of the internet like you're
saying people now have the power to go straight to the rest of the country by
the way we should make a bigger deal out of this because I'm a humble person I
mean that's my strength I mean I am humble because I realize it's all finite
which makes me feel pathetic that if I'm doing a good job who are these people
I'm beating I mean it's the opposite of power it's like are we actually that
good a species it's like the opposite but project Veritas goes undercover with
the New York Times and top YouTube executives are like our main job is to
stop Alex Jones and Veritas is like wow what are you doing that's kind of
miss upset and that just shows how weak they are not how strong I am but we
should make some promos and stuff so the audience me included gets the fact hey
we're what they're scared of so behind the curtain they're scared of this what
are they scared of they're scared of Americana they're scared of God they're
scared of Christ they're scared of God fear in Texas Americana prosperity where
people aren't such needle you know what's that they want to suppress people so
they feel powerful I want to see you rise I want to be successful that's what
they hate that's that spirit and I'm ready to kill people that attack me I'm
not scared and and so they also scared of that because they want to be killers
they want to be the mustique filled killers and killing for me is like
another you know thing in my Swiss army knife not that I'm some tough guy but if
I need to it's easy it's like it's like taking a piss and they don't understand
that well and they have to interfere with their algorithms that they've
developed to you know put us in these internet ghettos like dredge said they
have to manually interfere with the algorithms because people want to watch
inforce the growth that you know inforce and other alternative media outlets are
having they cannot control unless they manually step in and they've been doing
it and it's still not working no no they fell no matter what because you know
they come after inforce you launch newswords they come after our YouTube
channel we launch another YouTube channel what we really launch is the
talking points and everybody else realizing they're really the secret and
it's all them when I see people getting 70 million views and dwarfing us I love
it it's it's the people get Satanism is envy Satanism is is is jealousy of
something that's only helping you it's one thing if somebody takes your wife
away for no reason it ruins your life you should be mad at them but if
somebody's better than you and smarter than you in many respects of just saying
something I try to say in a whole hour in six minutes like Tatum because the
media is like Jones is praising a black guy saying he's articulate yeah like I'm
saying Trump is or you know anybody else the point is the guys better than me in
many ways that's a strength we all has to have a community that doesn't make me
weaker that makes me stronger well reaching people with the truth is what
intimidates them like I said they spend all this money trying to push allies on
the public and it's not working anymore the point is they've tried to already
threaten us all and threaten do stuff to us and we like it they haven't figured
it out that we're I don't want to explain it to them but good people have a big
good side they have a evil side the evil people only have their evil side they
cultivate that all day and think it's their power but if they actually measured
their evil next to ours ours is much bigger we're not proud of that we're
trying to get rid of our evil they just think because we don't use the evil that
we're that we're like chumps they don't understand we've transcended the evil
because of Christ a little bit that makes sense yeah explain it to them then
well they are so obsessed with this evil and they it shows you know they're
obsessed with Satanism they're obsessed with pedophilia they're obsessed with
abortion if you look at their their obsessive radical Islam which is the
worst system out there totally suppressive dirt baggery and they call
themselves progressives while they're pushing all of these things they're
pushing death they're pushing you know just evil and darkness and they're
obsessed with it and it's so pathetic who wants to kidnap a little kid and
ruin their dreams because you've got the will to take them in a basement and
rape them for a month well they beg for mommy and then when they finally pass out
and turn into catatonic mental illness you kill them oh I mean what that's not
power that's not power no as much as they would like to
powers getting up as a single mother and busting your ass and taking care of
those kids even though your husband ran off and seeing them successful that's
power yep it's building a family it's providing for them like you were talking
about earlier making sure your children have food making sure their their home
is protected when you lock everything up at night that's power you know faith in
Christ helping others I'll make an admission though I really do hate the
globalist Mike you've been here a couple years I mean what is it like studying
them every day watching them I mean I gotta be honest I'm guilty in the fact
that I lost after hurting them yeah I know you do we've had a lot of
conversations traveled a lot together we went to Hawaii and Seattle this summer
and it's it's the truth you hate these people I mean these people until you
finally defeat them you're gonna keep fighting every single day towards that
but I think you hate them too right yeah absolutely but just your drive and
passion you've you know you have this focus that you've turned this into the
biggest you know the tip of the spear as you put it but it's not just it I
don't want to hate them I hate what they do to people right and if they want to
fight and they want to grow in this big free country and then piss all over try
to bring it down for everybody else I just want them to get what they want I
want to accelerate where they want to take us but I want to happen to them not
us Mike right they want to just not our children no not their children if they
want to fight if they want to bang heads let's give it to them yeah you'd be
happy with with saving them too but no if they want to destroy everything if
they want to tear everything the Bible talks about it I should think I could
wake them up you can't they're turned over to it they've put everything they
have in the evil what do you make of a big so panicked no they know their days
are numbered when it comes to this they know that their systems are falling
apart they see it they expected Hillary to win they expected to be able to
continue all of this that the pots that they're engaged in but then Trump won
and they're panicking now they're using every weapon they have against the
president yeah and I'm sorry pedophiles you can't openly legalize the schools to
sexualize kids and if you can't rape them in the back room you're going to
convince 70-year-olds to have their generals cut off I'm sorry perverts
your Satanism and you'll be out in the open anymore make it legal to give
people AIDS yeah California legalizes giving blood of you of HIV or giving it
to somebody and they spin it like it's cute like it's a right I mean yeah the
Jerry Brown is a dying cockroach who's just trying to disease as many people as
he can and then of course the advocate came out claimed I was anti-gay people
yeah cuz I don't want gay men cutting holes in their condoms and giving other
gay men AIDS or HIV so I'm anti-gay it's proving their scum the people running
that want to prey on men and kill them they're really Satanist vampire spiders
that want to kill gay men that's what they are yeah the loving thing would be
to make sure these people don't get AIDS which is the death sentence the truth
is it's a targeted group they first put the AIDS in vaccines HIV and that's
their control group they want to have their way with that that's that's what
it is it's another attack on men with a ride bug
as most of you already know I am a voracious consumer of news and
information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research I
came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop
caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but

you're listening to the alex jones show
now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the
resistance it's alex jones anthony kumi is coming up final segment here with
Michael Zimmerman who just got back from Puerto Rico Matt one of the crew
members who I try to make it on air all the time this guy is like a super talk
shows behind the scenes he gets on air gets a little bit nervous so does that
that doesn't stumble over his words he just slows down real slow to make sure
he's saying it right and then Matt kind of stumbles over it but behind the scenes
he's better talk shows than I am and just as smart as we are smarter he's like
hey alex make the point but I don't want to plagiarize it he wants me to make
these points but I'm teleprompter free so this is not my brain saying this he
said this he's like alex notice we played it earlier governor brown will
give you prison time if you're a health care provider and you don't use the
weird GZ whatever the new thing is for a Facebook says there's 50 new sexes I
mean we don't learn reading writing and arithmetic we but we learn all this he'll
give you more jail time for not using a tranny's proper name or trend sexual's
proper name then they will if you give somebody HIV knowingly and they go but
it's liberal we're gonna try to kill you or give blood so I said to Matt just
come on here and say he goes no no no you do it but that's a great point
government yeah people's feelings are more important to the California
government and giving someone AIDS and possibly killing them and then that is
the key to the entire situation they take your real rights to privacy to
money to property to your own world and they give you feelings they give you
lingo they give you a new language exactly yeah here's the words you're
allowed to use here's the preferred pronouns but no when it comes to actual
things that matter they don't care they've already destroyed the family in
California they've already banned guns essentially you don't I mean I've said
this the only hypothesis that makes sense is there's some interdimensional
alien breakthrough that is channeling into these leftists because everything I
do destroy the atmosphere with Kim trailing destroy the family GMO you know
attack the attack men and women attack giving birth just everything they do is
what an alien attack would do if it was like a psychic takeover like a mind hack
you think of hack of computers but a hack of the mind and I'm not saying
that's what's happening I just hypothesis wise you look at the Bible and
every other the ancient Vedic text of the Indians they talked about sometimes
whole cities would go crazy and just start killing each other and it's like
is this like beamed in from Saturn it's a slow kill the stuff they're putting in
the water you know it's one thing after another and cumulatively they will
destroy us but I mean Jerry Brown is literally spreading HIV and hepatitis
everywhere and literally waging war on California and trying to bankrupt it and
trying to play I mean it what is he demon I mean like the rest of these
people they worship and celebrate evil and it's like avatar it's like you're
walking down the street in Seattle somebody looks totally normal it's like
agent Smith's I'm sitting they go they're walking on it and you go the
next street and some woman doesn't and you're like dude something's going on
it's like something jacks in and that's what it does it like hops around like a
lizard they these people look different the ones that have been totally
brainwashed you can see it in their face you can see it in their eyes they have
no life to them the one who threw coffee on you a homeless guy right after was
like oh man Alex you know I'm sorry that guy had a life in him he even confessed
to us he walked to breakfast with us and got breakfast with us that morning this
guy was addicted to heroin he's homeless but he said I said I realized
Seattle is all a giant temple to suck souls yeah that guy had more soul in
him even though he was suffering with drug addiction and things like that in
this potbelly goblin creature who's just how can I be evil he actually went
making those noises yeah I'm bumping up against you and they'll tell you I'm
ugly humanity's failed and they'll go you'll never get seen this yeah and you're
like what that's right I couldn't put it in the back yeah you're like okay a
planet yours huh another guy walks by goes exactly you're all dead yeah you're
like what happened here hey we don't know what's going on we're trying to
figure it out we want to save these people and we know the enemy hates us the
New York Times YouTube wants to shut down you know someone very profoundly once
said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America it'll come in the
name of liberalism

liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long
the silent majority is no longer silent this is the war room live from Austin
Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones hello yes I'm back Anthony
Kumiya in that info wars.com I was just watching Alex it's it's it's it's so
entertaining I cannot get enough of watching Alex Jones here on info wars.com
my god a few things have transpired since I was last here and I want to focus
first on on Hollywood Hollywood you know that wonderful place that gives us the
gifts of entertainment we we spend how much time do you think we spend watching
the the product that comes out of that town think about this we like to think
we would love to think that sitting down and watching the product movies
television shows even advertising to some extent that comes out of that world
and we would love to think it's there for our entertainment that's it right
these amazing people put together these amazing movies and fantasy scenarios and
and we get to escape from our drab little lives for a little while don't we
and it's fun and we spend a hell of a lot of time absorbing what they're putting
out and I don't use that word accidentally we absorb what they put out
and boy I I might sound like a giant hypocrite with what I'm gonna say because
I probably spend more time watching their product than most people I know I love
it I sit my ass in front of a television set or I in front of a movie screen and
I love it so much fun but look look at the community of people I use that term
loosely that are putting this stuff together and putting it out there every
every year I guess we could look at it that way we see what degenerates these
these people are that are putting out the stuff this product of theirs that we
cannot get enough of we sit down eyes and ears open absorbing absorbing
everything they're putting out there and again entertainment isn't sure it's
entertaining but if you don't think that there is some type of agenda that is
being thrown into your face on a daily basis from this this hive of scum and
villainy that is and I use that from a movie hive of scum and villainy that is
Hollywood you're out of your mind you're out of your mind if you don't think
that this sick perverse town is pumping out propaganda on a daily basis because
they know you are locked into it and can be influenced by it you're out of your
mind this town for years for years has been known to be what it is it's a
collection of extremely disturbed people with this sick ideology and this want
and need for some reason to deconstruct everything that has made the
country this country great over the course of history every institution that
we have that has any type of moral value to it has to be destroyed and
deconstructed by this this town this Hollywood town it's been glamorized over
the course of probably a century right I would guess glamorized as a place that
you know regular people I aren't allowed in you're not allowed in we watch all
their award shows on television we hear about their their personal lives and we
see where they live and where they're entertained we're not allowed there this
is a private little club such a small little enclave of these people that
have that have the ability to influence everyone else with their agenda driven
propaganda and if you look at the history of this it's been the same for
many years deconstruct and break down the value system that has made this
country great and there are so many reasons why this would happen an end
game I guess you'd call it and I honestly don't know what that end game is I
have some ideas I have some ideas I think American exceptionalism is one
thing they don't like that they want a more global society but I honestly have
to believe that there are just some sick people there are some sick perverse
people that have figured out how to to operate in relative safety in numbers
by by giving us something that we somehow cannot live without this
escapism and fantasy so they all get together they live these pretty perverse
lifestyles they have a hatred for what has has made this country great and they
do things with relative impunity and of course I talk about Harvey Weinstein the
latest in this collection of degenerates that has been exposed and
that's it he's been exposed this this has been going on for decades with this
guy Hollywood knew this was going on so when you hear all of these people all
the sudden coming out Kate Beckinsale I avoided Harvey Weinstein come on when
I was 17 by saying I had school in the morning I mean and these are this is one
story of just literally hundreds that are coming out about Harvey Weinstein but
if you think for a second these stories are coming out because people all the
sudden found out again stop open your eyes open your eyes and ears like you
do when you're sucking in that propaganda that they put on movie and TV
screens open wide because if you think for a second they didn't know everything
that was going on with this guy you're out of your mind our own a president of
Barack Obama the last one not the good one Barack Obama sent his own daughter
to work at the Weinstein corporation there the Weinstein company knowing
you're not going to tell me that the president of the United States did not
know that Harvey Weinstein was a complete serial predator and degenerate
disgusted Barack and Michelle Obama are disgusted by what they read about Harvey
Weinstein you mean to tell me Hollywood knew everyone knew popular
culture their own industry made jokes about it on award shows on 30 rock on
family guy it was the scuttle butt of the town because they're all like this
but you mean to tell me that when the Secret Service went to check out the
Weinstein company when the Obama's daughter was going to work over there
that they never heard a story that this degenerate was was serial harassing
sexually harassing women no they never knew Hillary Clinton again disgusted
never knew that this was happening they are all lawyers the hypocrisy that comes
out of Hollywood it could only rival the hypocrisy that comes out of Washington
and and we we I don't know why we have this this we give them the benefit of
the doubt we give them any bit of plausible deniability to run with
because they are all like that and everyone in that town knew exactly was
going what was going on and now they're just running for cover we'll be back of

to get a still deal with the the sickness that is going on in this country
and the focus right now Hollywood Hollywood is just a giant tumor on this
country it is it does go it makes perfect sense that it resides in the sick
state of California by the way as alex was talking about just before the fact
that you could go to jail for using an improper what do they call it an
improper label pronoun pronoun that's it pronoun for LGBT next why is he you could
actually go to jail for that in certain circumstances yet yet if you give somebody
AIDS if you know that you have AIDS and then you transmit that through a sexual
sexual contact that's fine California says that's fine you knowingly exposed
others HIV gets no longer felony in California to give someone a death
sentence is no longer felony but pairs the thought you say him or her when
somebody feels like a her or him oh boy that's trouble it makes perfect sense
please please San Andreas fault if you're listening if the San Andreas fault is
listening could you please shake rattle and roll that state right into the
Pacific could you do us a favor here Hollywood is just a glamour central
glitter city Tinseltown and it is one of the sickest places on the face of the
earth and if you don't see the fear also we talk about the the sickness the
depravity the propaganda that is being pumped out of Hollywood but we we rarely
talk about the utter and complete fear that it just envelops Hollywood people
are petrified to speak out about what's going on in that town I guess Rose
McGowan Rose McGowan you might have seen her she she was in Charmed I guess
Charmed she went out for a little while with Marilyn Manson and she's been in a
few things a few movies from Tarantino who by the way Miramax did his movies
by the way was run by the Weinstein's at the time it all comes together it all
it's the biggest incestuous sick stew that has been on the on the stove brewing
for decades so Rose McGowan has been tweeting a lot about Weinstein about
Weinstein's cronies about the this this whole thing that goes on in Hollywood
with sexual abuse and powerful people perpetrating crimes against other
people using their dreams I guess against them everyone has a dream of
being a star so Rose McGowan has come out and calling out people like Matt Damon
like Casey and Ben Affleck who of course worked with Weinstein but again they
never knew everyone knew but no one knew what was going on in Hollywood isn't it
amazing isn't amazing so now they all come out they're apologizing left and
right but they're doing it publicly if you really wanted to apologize for
someone wouldn't you just do it privately well it doesn't help if you do
it privately yeah there's which look I'm not in Rose McGowan's camp either she's
a tad bit of a hypocrite you dress like that and I gotta tell you there's gonna
be some issues with guys maybe maybe getting the wrong idea wrong idea
perhaps but of course you'd call me you know victim blaming if you look at a
woman out in public like that go ah maybe a guy's gonna say something to you
that you might not appreciate but again that's the sickness that goes on I
really fear for her life she's calling out a lot of people a lot of powerful
people others are petrified to do it why just because they won't get work that's
probably part of it but I wouldn't put it past these sick individuals especially
those in very high places in Hollywood to get rid of people to literally
dispose of people Twitter figuratively killed off Rose McGowan I guess they
didn't like what she was saying about some powerful people and Ben Affleck
she dropped the F bomb in one of her tweets about Ben Affleck and her Twitter
account has been frozen I know what this is like Twitter YouTube a lot of these
places just cannot take the truth they do not like the truth when it reflects
poorly on all of the different industries that weave together and the
powerful people that run them yeah Rose McGowan Twitter account locked after
post about Weinstein and Affleck and Matt Damon and then we have another thing
Corey Feldman a couple of years back was talking about Elijah Wood and the
Hollywood pedophilia controversy there's apparently a huge pedophilia problem
in Hollywood and of course Corey Feldman he was teamed up for many years with
Corey Hame when they were youngsters in Hollywood and the stories of pedophilia
running rampant in Hollywood these powerful men stories of parties and
and these these young boys just being thrown in to these sick men to have
their way with them and Corey Feldman will not mention names if you see
something like this going on that literally led to the death of one of
his friends Corey Hame who had a problem with drug abuse wound up dying a very
early age and and he has said that it's a direct result of the assaults that
happened to him in his youth but he won't even say who the who's what's and
when's because he's petrified think about that why would you be that scared
especially if you're Corey Feldman it's not like you're missing work it's not
like somebody's not gonna give you a gig haven't worked in years but he's scared
of something what is that he's a powerful dangerous sick people that run
that town we'll be back in moments please stay with us

you're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting
worldwide it's Alex Jones welcome back how are you doing Anthony come here in
it in four wars calm yeah the there's a connection to between Hollywood and
Washington man to do politicians love celebrities don't they how many pictures
have we seen of politicians with Harvey Weinstein and the they they seem to go
hand-in-hand you watch these award shows and all you see are celebrities getting
up there and giving their their political views which I think I could go out on a
limb and say a little left-leaning just a little left-leaning we saw Eminem the
other day oh my god was this embarrassing I'm on Twitter and I see
oh Eminem really wow did he just tear up Donald Trump oh my god look out he's
back shady's back and he's gonna he's tearing up Donald Trump so I'm like all
right I'll watch this right from the get-go it was so embarrassing first of
all he's he's what mid 40s now he's like 44 something like that and there he is in
yeah he's in a like a parking garage with some like thuggish dudes behind him
and stuff like this might work if you're in your your 20s still it just kind of
looks silly at this point that this guy in his mid 40s it's like when you see
guys in their mid 40s like skateboarding all right if you enjoy it and
everything that's one thing that's fine but don't make that your thing don't go
out into public and make it your thing because you're kind of gonna look silly
so when you get Eminem up there and he's he's spitting some rhymes yo it comes off
looking very silly and the whole gist of this thing was how awful and terrible
Donald Trump is he's with the bravery the bravery of Eminem to come out against
Donald Trump at a time like this it could be the the hackiest thing people
do in the entertainment industry and now is to do any material about Donald
Trump I personally don't get it whether you like or don't like Donald Trump's
policies whether you think he's not that smart or or not a good speaker or
anything you could have all these opinions about him but I've yet to get a
rational answer from anyone on the left what he's done so wrong and what his
motivations are for for becoming the president and doing the job of the
president because I see this I see a man who who got very wealthy and successful
utilizing the opportunities that are given everyone in this country did he
have a father that gave him money I know that that's a big issue sure do some
people start out with a little more than others on their road to success indeed
they do that's part of the the freedoms of this country not everyone starts out
the same not everyone ends up the same some people use a more skill than luck
with others it's the other way around that's the amazing thing about this
country is that there is the possibility for anyone to do well you're not just
born and thrust into a rice patty or or put a soldering together iPhones knowing
that that's gonna be your life and wherever you are that's what you're
gonna continue doing till you drop dead no we have the opportunity in this
country to do great things and all I see in our president Donald Trump is the
the the want to to give that opportunity to everybody of course he's
called racist all the time when I and I ask and I want a rational answer but I
can never get it what has he done that that shows what a racist he is for some
reason for 35 40 years in the public eye was never called a racist I mean this
guy's been on TV he's been a a contractor a builder for for decades no
one ever called him a racist all the sudden he's a racist and of course M&M
slams Trump and calls him a racist he's a sexist always sexist it's terrible
he's a man who enjoys the company of pretty women you know that makes him a
man that makes him a man or what a man used to be I believe you're not even
allowed to do that anymore but the accusations that I see from the left
coming out about Donald Trump they never have a rational discussion with me
about why he's labeled these things did he say some inappropriate stuff sure if
you look at what men talk about as inappropriate stuff because that's all
he was doing anyone that says different again is lying many men talk this way
about women and their sex ploits over the years guys will discuss things like
that but I see a president in Donald Trump that just wants to make things
better for this country and he is he's doing just that but the left can't take
it so the likes of M&M and a lot of these actors and actresses that are
crying I've seen genuine tears come out of people's eyes when they just talk
about Donald Trump I was watching a clip the other day it was hilarious I guess
it was some antifa people and some some gentlemen from info wars was was
questioning some of these people asking about Donald Trump and what these
people were even protesting a woman ran away ran away from the microphone from
this gentleman's inquiry in tears and I'm just laughing my ass off at this
point because that really epitomizes what they're all about they give you no
answers you cannot get a straight answer yeah this is this is so look at this
girl right here look at the one in the in the back she's already choking up and
she runs off crying it's astounding but that epitomizes what what we we see when
when the left is addressing politics and Donald Trump and what they want they
scream about impeachment we see maxine waters constantly now screaming about
impeachment this woman is out of her mind out of her mind and she's screaming
about impeachment when there's nothing that indicates that this president can
legally be impeached yet it's her her mantra now it's her battle cry that we
need to impeach Donald Trump and then again you ask these people why for what
and they have no reason whatsoever aside from my feels my emos are hurt and
then you dig a little deeper well can you give me an exam and they run off in
tears you have to laugh you have to laugh I'm wondering if after a few more
years I'll start actually feeling sorry for them we're almost at a year people
we are almost at the one year mark where we recall the first real tears of the
left in the Javits Center when Hillary Rodham Clinton did not show up to
console her people after the election I can't believe it's almost been a year
next month the beginning of next month is a year and the tears have not stopped
it's been a year-long cry fest you ever see a child having a temper tantrum in a
store they don't want to be there with mommy or something and they cry imagine
that kid kicking and screaming and crying on the floor for a year and it's
not gonna end we're gonna see this temper tantrum for at least three more
years perhaps even longer I hope we'll be back December 23rd 1776 these are the
times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot Wheel
in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by
it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not
easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of
the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we
esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives everything its value heaven
knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if
so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated Britain with an
army to enforce her tyranny has declared that she has a right not only to tax but
to bind us in all cases whatsoever and if being bound in that matter is not
slavery then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth even the expression
is impious for so unlimited a power can only belong to God Thomas Payne the

bones ladies and gentlemen we're back Anthony Kumi in at info wars.com I am
very skeptical I'm just a natural born skeptic I'm from that what is that
Occam's razor is that what they call it if something seems like this is what
happened that's probably what happened I'm kind of one of those guys I am it's
very tough to convince me that something is different than what obviously
could have happened I do not feel this way about the Las Vegas shooting something
is amiss with this entire story of course we we we know Steven Steven
Patek there it is Occam's razor yeah it's just it's it's whatever the obvious
explanation is is is pretty much what it is another way say the more yeah the
more subject you have to make the more unlikely an explanation is and I believe
in this I I think I adhere to this more than not but again this situation in Las
Vegas is bizarre I don't know why more people aren't talking about this and I
honestly think when you have something like we do with social media these days
you would think that the the ability to exchange ideas and and evidence and
explanations would make us look into these things more question more things
but for some reason our our our ability to to concentrate on any one thing for
any longer than maybe a few days has screwed us up we're on to the next thing
well I'm kind of hanging out on this one because a nothing makes sense there
is so many loose ends with this story of course the the official story is that
Steven Patek went up into his room and started shooting out the window at a
concert killed a bunch of people wounded a bunch of others shot himself end of
story nothing's nothing is making sense on this one the timeline is now
different he supposedly shot a security guard after he shot a bunch of the
the concertgoers and that tipped off the police who then came in breached the door
he had killed himself that's the story well now they're saying that Steven
Patek shot the security guard before he unloaded on the crowd how do you make
that mistake and how does that go unexplained or unresolved for days for
days and days on end all of a sudden the story changes and and is completely
different how is it that Steven Patek's house gets broken into the other day
someone broke into his house through the front door they don't know who they
didn't catch anyone they got no leads it completely contaminates his house and
you might think well the FBI obviously searched his house well hypothetically
what if another piece of evidence leads them to need to look a little closer
inside this guy's house all of a sudden anything you find or don't find is
possibly tainted how did that happen and why there are so many loose ends to
this story reports of multiple gunmen sound analysis of the shots that imply
that there were multiple gunmen why so many guns in the room and the biggest
thing I've been to Las Vegas I've been to Atlantic City I've been to other
places where there are casinos could possibly be the most surveilled place
places on the face of the earth there is is I have yet to see one frame of this
guy I've seen maybe two pictures one where he looks pretty goofy and another
one where he's in a bar I think but these were pictures that people took of
him I've yet to see one frame of surveillance footage of this gentleman
yet in 2001 we saw the next day after 9-11 we saw Mohammed Atta going through
security at Logan Airport and in 2017 at a casino I have yet to see one frame
of this guy again I don't know what that means but it sure means something I don't
understand why we're not getting more information from the police from the FBI
why who is this guy what was the motivation why does he have this
Philippines connection we don't hear any more about the money he said we hear
this insanity from his brother and all of it just gets swept away and then
we're all you know hashtag Harvey Weinstein and hashtag Vegas shooting
gets thrown in the bin with Coney 2012 we really need people like Alex Jones
and info wars to stick to this story and try to get some kind of answers it
doesn't it's not making sense we've I'm certain we've seen instances of actual
lunatics for no reason then they're insane that have gone and murdered
people and taken their own life or what have you this does not look like that
there's way too much going on here that we're not getting an explanation for you
know the things we know and don't know what happened in the six minutes after
the hotel security guard was shot well the police have their theory but it
doesn't jive with with other timelines of the shooting why weren't there the
number of shell casings there should have been why did this guy take his life
apparently before the police were even alerted to where he was was he the only
one in the room how did he get all those guns up why take so many guns he
didn't use every gun why have so many guns in that room was he supposed to
meet somebody or some other a group of people wasn't an arms deal gone bad did
he get converted to something all right Islam over the course of some of his
travels his airplane at a government site like none of this is your run-of-the-mill
if I could say that shooting by just some some lunatic they actually checked
his brain out too isn't that sick they cut him open you know they checked his
brain out and apparently nothing in there that indicated he had any medical
problems that would have led him to just snap and do that so again I I strongly
suggest we we pay attention to this and keep tabs on what is and and sometimes
more importantly what isn't being said by law enforcement to the people and when
you see something pop up like the Weinstein thing that distracts us don't
be so distracted keep your eyes and ears open all the time Anthony Kumi you can
catch me on compound media dot com the arty Lang and Anthony Kumi a show on
compound media Monday through Thursday 4 p.m. sorry Houston go Yankees I'll see
it in a couple of weeks thank you
