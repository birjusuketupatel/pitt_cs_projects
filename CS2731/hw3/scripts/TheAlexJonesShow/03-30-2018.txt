You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report, it's Alex Jones.
I have a confession to make. I support the Parkland students. I support their call for gun control.
Do I support their call for gun control because I think they're going to achieve any significant gun control measures? No.
I support them because this issue is perhaps the only thing that can energize conservatives and get them out to vote in the midterms.
Look what's happened in the polls since the left began this gun control crusade.
Republicans were 15 points behind in the race for the House. Now that's narrowed to 5 points almost within the margin of error.
Most conservatives were calling the House a write-off, but now it's game on again.
Why? Because gun control is a losing issue for Democrats. It always has been.
After Bill Clinton passed an assault weapons ban, he lost 54 seats in the House.
The Democrats have made the midterm elections a referendum on Trump.
Now Trump needs to make the midterm elections a referendum on constitutional rights.
This is how he energizes the base. This is how he turns out voters.
The entire March for Our Lives campaign has been one huge own goal.
The left just couldn't contain their arrogance. First it was banning bump stocks and restricting AR-15 sales.
Now it's ban all guns, take them from your cold dead hands and repeal the Second Amendment.
When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
Because only Trump's Nazi regime and racist police officers should be allowed to have weapons, right?
Oh yeah, and the security at gun control rallies. But seriously, they've made a huge political error.
Notice how some Democrats responded to that New York Times op-ed.
Think Progress, Washington Post, they're all panicking.
They realized that this gun control purge has woken up Republicans from their slumber.
Listen to what the Washington Post's Aaron Blake said.
The move might as well be considered an in-kind contribution to the National Rifle Association,
to Republicans' efforts to keep the House and Senate in 2018, and to President Trump's 2020 re-election bid.
Shh, don't tell them what we actually plan to do, idiots. You might rile them up and give them a reason to vote against us.
You have over 100 million semi-automatic weapons in the United States right now. What do you do with those?
You know what? You give them that's a real question.
See, that's exactly what I mean. How insane do you need to be to think you can disarm 70 million American gun owners of 300 million guns with no consequences whatsoever?
The left is actually that crazy, and the fact they've let slip this agenda is blowing up in their faces.
The march for our lives was just a huge recruitment drive for Democrats.
Less than 10% of the attendees were children. You really think those who organized the protests, the big Soros groups, the big Democratic organizations,
really care about ending gun violence.
No, they care about power, but they've made a huge tactical mistake.
Gun control is as toxic an issue to the Democratic Party as Hillary Clinton was, so let them keep talking about it.
Amplify their voices. Don't interrupt the enemy when they're making a mistake.
Look what's happened already. Gun sales are surging again.
The midterm polls are tightening. Even in CNN's poll, Trump's approval rating is climbing.
NRA donations more than tripled in February.
This is backfiring on the left massively.
And to conservatives, don't argue with teenagers.
The optics of arguing with children are terrible. Let them talk. Let them continue to piss off gun owners.
Gun owners who will then be more determined than ever to vote against Democrats in November.
If you criticize some of what they're saying, then all of a sudden you're the bad guy.
You are the bad guy.
No, I agree with Don Lemon.
Don't criticize the Parkland students. Encourage them.
Because in their rush to exploit tragedy and use children as political props, the left has made a huge miscalculation.
One that could actually give conservatives a chance this November of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.

Alex Jones
Scum, Russian scum.
Until the war comes to mind.
Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
Bill, vote on or before the 12th for Donald J. Trump for President. Thank you.
That was Saturday at a rally in Florida. Trump was asking supporters to raise their hands,
vowing to vote for him in the March 15th primary. But that led to headlines like these,
where some compared that moment to something that might have happened at a rally in Nazi Germany.
We all look at Adolf Hitler in 1940. We should look at Adolf Hitler in 1929.
He was a kind of a funny kind of character that said the things that people were thinking.
Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea. But Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things that he has been saying.
So I had one of Hitler's speeches translated into English and I think this tells us a lot about where Donald Trump is getting his ideas.
Look at this Hitler speech and we've translated it for you. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to make Germany great again.
That I can tell you, believe me. So when people ask why you support Donald Trump, you just tell them.
He's going to take our economy from here to here.
My understanding is you want to clear the air because you think you're being unfavorably compared to Donald Trump.
Don't get me wrong, Conan. I agree with a lot. He says a lot, like 90% of what he says. I'm like, this guy gets it.
But it's just, I don't like the way he says it. It's just, it's crass.
Yeah. Yeah. Trump is very, very crass. Yeah.
So Sarah Silverman can dress up in a Hitler outfit and then connect it to Trump.
And you know what? I say she has that right to absolutely do that 100% under the First Amendment, under satire. She can do it.
He's a public figure.
But I have ordered a Hitler uniform. It's coming. It should be here next week.
And I guarantee you, when I put that thing on and I get in here and I interview one of the other crew members, say, oh, it's Shroy or David Knight.
And I endorse Hillary and I endorse Obama.
And then I endorse their policies that are very Hitlerian like censorship and invading countries and war and using racial based politics to control people.
I guarantee you that there'll be thousands of news articles that I am the devil and that it needs to be censored.
You know why I know Darren McBrain put together a video on Friday that was a minute and a half long of David Hogg wearing an armband and giving solutions.
And he doesn't just put the fist up. He turns militarily the way Hitler would.
He's obviously being choreographed. He's being coached.
I'm not saying they're crisis actors. I'm saying they're spokespersons, the Democratic Party and George Soros.
He funds it. Private jets, buses, everything.
And when we point that out, they spin it.
Vice has put out a big report editing my video to make it sound like I'm saying nobody died and that Hogg is a crisis actor.
They're still doing it to misrepresent what I've said.
Now I'm saying out of 3,000 students, they picked four, rolled them out, deployed them and that's admitted.
BuzzFeed's written about it. It's a fact. They brag about it. The New York Times brags.
But if you look at how Hogg turns and then thrust his arm up, that's how it's done militarily as a solute, as a fascist salute.
He clicks his heels, ladies and gentlemen, which takes it from fascista with Mussolini to the Germans added the heel clicking.
And then it becomes Austrian-Hungarian Empire salute, merge with the Roman salute.
I remember one time we were in art class and they took us to the museum and I remember the students going,
we didn't know there were Nazis in Rome because there was a famous painting of Roman generals hailing Roman emperor and that's the salute.
I won't even do it because the media will grab it and say I did it, but what Hitler did, outstretched the whole deal.
You click your heels though, baby, it's a Nazi salute.
And now I'm starting to think they baited us, put him in the armband and having him do all that.
So they go, look, the survivors, the children, they're comparing it to Nazis.
Well, man, you're wearing armbands and clicking your heels, bro.
And say, they're shaking in their boots. We're going to get them.
And now we've got all these videos of Hogg's cussing and screaming and we're going to effing shut these people up and we're going to take them out.
Believe me, bro, I know CNN and your name came within inches of knocking our YouTube channel off.
That's reached billions of people.
So people make the comparisons to Nazi youth.
Many have made that done control youth movements, the less more akin to Mao and his youth movements, but he also took the guns.
We cover all of that and they turn it around and say, you're hateful.
You need to be banned.
And the video that the green put out disappeared off of our YouTube site Saturday.
They didn't give us a strike.
It just disappeared.
And then everywhere else it was, it disappeared.
And then we tried to re upload it and it won't let us re upload it.
And everyone else is now reporting just like the purge of guns two weeks ago on YouTube and the purges before that.
They never announced them till we point them out till Drudge points it out and they admit they're purging.
Everyone memes Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, anyone comparing.
Hog and the youth movements parallel to Nazi Germany, which are very strong parallels is being banned or blocked.
And then there's all these news articles attaching me saying, why is Joan still even online ban him for calling David Hog and Nazi?
Well, even if I did call him a Nazi, he's a public figure and I can make those parallels.
And then if he wanted to try to take me to court and win a lawsuit, which he wouldn't then then maybe YouTube could take down a video.
But no, the argument from the left is ban anyone that says the left is racist or the left is connected to Hitler.
And then we show you the art and the memes that we didn't even create that compare him to a brown shirt.
And then they have the Daily Mail say, look what Jones made.
So they also journalistically misrepresent what we've covered and what we've done and what we're showing you.
You know, when CNN shows Hog compared to Hitler and show somebody else's work with CNN saying Hog was Hitler.
These are the semantical games they play and they have total disdain for you.
Look, it's people's right.
David Hog's a public figure trying to take an American basic right and they go, well, he's a survivor.
You know, I think the shooting happened.
I think he was there, but we can play the video where he says he was at home and wrote his bike there.
Then he said he was always there during the shooting.
Then he's in there doing interviews while the shooting is going on, supposedly.
And all I'm saying is if somebody says something and then they say something completely different, I have a right.
Whether they're a public figure or not, and he is a public figure to then say that's a little interesting.
I question that.
I think that's interesting.
And look, people are making these memes.
I knew something was off about that kid.
Made three days ago, but there's just thousands of these.
And they're saying you can't do that.
Meanwhile, Hillary moderator at Rutgers invokes Nazism and Trump.
And then Hillary talks about how scared she is.
That's coming up.
So again, they say the OK sign is Nazi.
They say just having short hair is evil if you're a white guy.
Everything's Nazi.
Everyone's a Nazi.
Hitler's, you know, taking over.
Trump's Hitler.
I'm Hitler.
But then they've got their public figure out there actually clicking his heel and doing fascist salutes.
We're like, man, this is creepy.
They're like, you can't say that.

Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
Introducing pollen block.
We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory functions.
In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research,
a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
You want answers? Well, so does he.
Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
Watch out, it's hard to do the show right now.
I walked out there during the break and one of the crew members, a good friend of mine,
and I've known him for like nine years, looked like...
Well, he looked super alive. He looked upset.
I was like, what's going on? He told me his brother is a friend of mine.
Their baby two weeks early died with the umbilical cord wrapped around it tonight.
He said the saddest part was seeing his brother's wife hold the baby this morning.
And I said, you need to get back down to LeBronfels. You need to get out of here. You need to go.
It just hit me how precious life is and how precious my little 11 month old daughter is, how sweet she is with an angel.
And then what abortion does and then how they sell the body parts and how on one hand we know how precious children are.
And if a man shoots a woman who's six months pregnant, he gets a double, double homicide count against him.
But when the government does it, it's okay. And I'm not here judging people who've had abortions.
That's how they get you in the trap is, you know, you've had abortions, you've been involved in abortions.
I have. The media then goes, Jones is a hypocrite. He admits he's been involved in abortions and he's against him.
Yeah, it's called the space time continuum. It's called when I was a teenager, I did bad things and I pledged to never do it again and I haven't.
I got four children and I think my lucky stars every time they're healthy and they're born and then I just I have nightmares about it.
I have serious guilt.
Anytime I think about the globalist killing me or something bad happening, I just think about the children and I have no fear, just zero.
When I think about what I've done.
I mean, if someday I'm in some globalist prison and they're torturing me, I deserve it because of what I did to my children.
I'm a murderer. I've paid money. I've killed 10 of my children that I know of murdered them.
The difference is I'm sorry and I know I'm wrong and I repent.
And I was young and stupid.
And I believe the propaganda.
And most of the girls wanted to have the abortions, but a couple of them didn't.
I think about those magic children I'd have today, but you know what? I wouldn't have the children I have today if I hadn't had children back then.
It's all part of life. So I don't judge you. God judges you.
And it's the heart that matters.
But you think about the Satanist and these globalists, they love it. They love it.
When I first went out and covered and then ended up being part of anti-abortion demonstrations in Austin back in the mid nineties,
I remember how scared the women were going in those places of not of us 100 yards away, but of what they were about to do.
And once they get them in there, they pressure them to do it.
And those women don't even know they can be paid between 50 and $300,000 to have the baby through an adoption agency.
And then they'll get the person a job afterwards.
And there's more people wanting to adopt every year than there are even abortions. People don't know that. There's a whole market.
But the globalists want those kids dead.
And the left always says, nobody wants black babies.
And then the left fights to make sure whites can't adopt blacks so they can kill them.
And that's what Margaret Sanger did. It's what the left is. The left is the real KKK.
I don't just say that. The Democratic Party is the most upset it is right now.
The Democratic Party today is the most upset it's been about the reassurgence and free market and nationalism.
They're the most upset they've been since the end of the Civil War when slavery got abolished.
Think about that. That's not a statement or a bumper sticker. That's who these crazy people are.
And we go out to these abortion clinics and the pro-abortion people would show up and they always had satanic tattoos on them.
They always were like, drugged out, looked like their soul was sucked.
They could be black. They could be white with their skin. Looks kind of green.
You've seen the videos and they just go, eh. And they're not even trying to act like they're possessed to freak us out.
They are just whacked out of their minds and they always go, we love murdering children and we love it.
We're going to keep killing them and we love Satan and I love killing my own babies and I've killed a lot of them.
You'll see like, you know, the little wannabe vampire pig guy.
You know, they're going, yeah, I've paid for hundreds of boys. I love it. It's my religion.
And that is who they are. And they're there with black tarps coming and trying to block our signs.
And it's like, not an art project for them. You couldn't try to look that evil and soul sucked.
It's real because even the tarp papers all wrinkle and they're kind of making hardly, lift their arms up to do it.
And they love how they're desiccated and soul sucks.
It's like, oh, we love how ugly we are and how much we smell and how we hate our, we want to murder children.
And this is on video. And you're like, oh, my God, this is real.
These people really don't have an operating system that's in this universe with God.
They are jacked into like Avatar by Slimer on PCP and it's just amazing to see that.
And it's amazing to understand that the name of the video is Communist Attack Alex Jones at anti-abortion protest.
That's the name of the video.
And it's just incredible to see what these people are like.
And then to know they're the people running YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
We have the behind the scenes videos. They're the ones.
They hate Christians. They hate God. They hate free market. They hate success.
And you're like, but you're working in the power structure.
And they just giggle at you because they're just completely twisted.
I got to take this phone call.
Yeah, roll some of this video. Roll some of this video.
Go ahead and roll some of the Satanist showing up.
On today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshipers, maybe you can call the 18.
How many did I insult? I killed my kids.
I killed my kids.
One f***ing friend was faced with a f***ing veil that doesn't stand for women's rights.
Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
That's pretty cool, man.
Is that you on the Facebook?
Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
I don't think so.
I don't understand it. I f***ing love it.
How do you get your abortion space?
I pay for that.
How many pay for it?
Upwards of 50.
Oh, yeah.
F*** you, you piece of f***ing s***.
Bunch of misogynistic motherf***ers.
Take your mail privilege somewhere else.
What's up, are you being aggressive?
I'm being aggressive.

We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen.
And I make it really easy.
We went out and looked at what the top
new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy
for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
And we created a stronger formula
than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
It's very simple.
We went out and looked, look, what is the top?
What is the best?
We'll just put even more product in.
We'll make it better.
Leading competitors, but $2 a product in it.
$2.60.
We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
It's $19.95 right now.
So you get an incredible top-of-the-line
new tropic for $19.95.
Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average,
we need that $15, $20.
We make the fund this operation
in the face of the global threat of it.
But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it
coming in in two weeks.
I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
And I want people that haven't tried Brainforce
to try it and find out why it's got
$6,000 plus five-star reviews.
It's amazing.

You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
Avorted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
But now children are literally being passed through the furnace
in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
They're being sacrificed on the altar
of efficiency and prosperity.
What is the secret of Silent Green?
The powdered flesh from dead babies.
Some people believe they can cure disease.
Because of its enormous popularity,
Silent Green is in short supply.
Remember, Tuesday is Silent Green Day.
The supply of Silent Green has been exhausted.
You must evacuate the area.
Okay, it's silent green.
It's important to rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo,
Big Builder Bird Group company,
are not allowed to know what they're using
the baby parts for and the flavoring,
but we already know.
So enjoy the flavor.
We're going to get the real solution,
which is going to be a combination of death panels
and sales taxes.
I'm consistently pro-death.
I'm for assisted suicide.
I'm for regular suicide.
I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
Is spending a million dollars
on that last three months of life for that patient,
would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers
and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
But that's called the death panel,
and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
They told me to say that they were sorry,
but that you had become unreliable.
Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
Any kind of society that would do this to its children
will do it to its senior citizens.
It will do it to its dissidents.
That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police,
on its army, on its prison guards,
on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
This is nothing but a suicide cult.
The scoops are on their way.
The scoops are on their way.
I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
You will find out why
Soylent Green means life.
You will find out why
Soylent Green means death.
We've got to stop them.
Come on.
This is the secret of Soylent Green.
Soylent Green is people.
It means they will be breeding us like cattle for food.
You've got to tell them.
Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
If you just watched or listened to that piece
we put together like four years ago,
that is real-world hospitals being heated with baby parts,
fetuses being used for the production of vaccines,
cosmetics, flavor testing for Pepsi.
Mixed with the 1970s sci-fi film Soylent Green.
So you see how we're here.
And we don't have to be here.
It's not a dystopia.
They're making it a dystopia.
And it's very, very critical that we become conscious of this.
You know, I started the broadcast out with all the huge news we've got
with the fact that we now know,
because now the public's paying attention
to what the big tech companies have been doing,
that they are the royalty.
They are the new aristocracy.
And that they are completely above the law.
Judicial Watch has got more documents where they are kept
in private, gilded government paid for facilities.
And that it expanded under Obama with the government jets
and everything else.
And that the tech companies have been merged
with the Democratic Party as a breakaway civilization.
And that's now Fox News reporting on that, calling it that.
A new government, a new civilization,
a whole other technological separate gilded group.
Now, you know, they got this Netflix show about the Maharajee,
you know, out in Oregon and all the rest of it
and all the nightmare sex cult stuff
and it's tied into Ariana Huffington and the rest of it.
That's nothing compared to Google.
The Google execs come into rooms of the other executives
in an amphitheater and then everyone has to chant
you are a golden dragon, you are an ornate building.
You go, well, that's silly.
No, that's not silly.
That's a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drill.
You know, they did Kool-Aid drinking drills
three times a day.
They did it thousands of times.
And finally, when it was a real Kool-Aid with a cyanide,
bye-bye, everybody gulped it down.
And that's what the left's doing with all of this is
Kredo saying we're going to take the word fatherland
or motherland out of the national anthem
and now we're not going to have mother on forums.
It's hurtful.
Say that again.
Imagine the science fiction movie in the 50s
where in the future the word mother is illegal.
Remember, I should tell you that one day
there will be a conspiracy theory that women
ever had uteruses or had babies or that breasts
were mammary glands and produced milk.
That's the asexual world that the UN envisioned
before it was even founded.
That's in Brave New World Revisited, the nonfiction book,
1961.
I keep going back to that because you can go read
the brother of the head of the World Eugenics Society
saying my brother taught me all this.
This is their plan.
They're going to end the family one day.
Their goal is to basically have the family broken up
by the year 2000.
Well, they're behind, but boy, they're trying to catch up.
You understand?
This is real, folks.
And they attack it from saying get rid of the family
at one level or bring in 10 million Muslims
and let them date your nine-year-old daughter
and have the Swedish government put out a manual
on adult men with minor daughters.
Yeah, in fact, the government of Alberta has now
banned the words mother and father in schools.
You don't use it.
And you're like, wow, that's next level.
It has nothing to do with a man that wants to take hormones
and wants to be a woman.
There are people inclined that way.
I'm a libertarian. That's your issue.
You just, once you can't criticize that
or even use the word, I mean, Twitter calls us.
Facebook calls us and they say, we don't care.
You're not allowed to use the word tranny.
We don't care if you're not even attacking those people.
We've got the recordings back there.
We recorded them.
And I'm sitting there in these phone calls
and Rob's using these phone calls,
our news director going,
that is a term created by that community
and it's free speech anyways.
And Facebook said in 2017 and Twitter,
they had a meeting and decided they were banning.
You understand, that's these tech giants.
They sit around and they go, well,
we're going to have a big contest in 2019.
We're going to have a big global vote.
And she's that way.
If the people vote that they want words banned,
then we'll do it. No, no.
It is dangerous speech that is the protected speech.
Political speech that is the most protected.
They're going to have a vote.
Google and Facebook and Twitter next year.
They've announced it on banning the words he and she do do do do do do do.
Q. Up the music for Twilight Zone.
And people will act a bunch of crazy liberals on them.
Universities, they're not.
That's where they're getting the brainwash core
to go out and man all this.
But it's already coming out with AI,
algorithms, all the other systems.
They're getting rid of everything.
And if they can ban mama or dad or he or she,
they can ban it all.
Next stop, the New World Order Zone.
This isn't fiction. It's a real place.
You're living in it right now.
Breakaway civilization has siphoned off human ingenuity
and technology to build separate reservations for the elite
who believe they're about to merge with machines
and live forever.
Next stop is the Info War.
Next stop is, do you care?
Because you're being told what's going on.
You see it now.
And that's why they have to destroy me.
And why they're throwing everything evil they've got at us right now
to censor us and take us down and block us and you name it.
It's because they're making their big move.
This is it.
Now we come back.
We've got a lot of incredible news that we need to get to.
Trump saying pull out of Syria.
That is in countermanding with each state.
This is huge, really good news.
Stay with us.
You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products,
we have it in Full War's life.
It'd take hours.
Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price.
It's stronger.
It's the other equation in probiotics.
It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
It's back in stock.
The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
It's got the preglonone.
That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
So you can upload it in our latest product.
It goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine 4-5 toothpaste.
It's super blue silver immune gargle.
It's a spray you do.
You can also swallow it.
It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
Without you, we couldn't do it.
So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you
that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
And it's so essential to spread the word.
And thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
as you can possibly get.
You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
Now it's time to change our bodies.
With Z-Field, infowarslife.com.
InfoWarslife Brainforce Plus is our number one selling product by Leafs and Bounds,
and for a good reason.
Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were,
what were most popular, what were best, what people liked,
and we made it even stronger.
Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
We only have 150%, and then it helps funder operation.
Well, now it's 50% off.
That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill
that takes about seven days to kick in.
Brainforce takes about 30 minutes.
But the two go together, it's the mind and body challenge.
They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping
with the combo at infowarslife.com.
But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers
are about to sell out infowarslife.com to get your Brainforce Plus and real red pill today.
I want to get into the really good Syrian news and why it's so seismic in a moment.
But first, just getting back to what I covered at the beginning of the broadcast.
Sarah Silverman, Charlie Chaplin in the old days, John Cleese, Monty Python,
they all dressed up like Hitler and made fun of Nazis.
And nobody said, hey, you shouldn't be able to do that.
And the Democrats compare anybody who isn't a total globalist leftist to Nazis
and say, you're racist.
And then if we make real parallels to the youth march and George Soros,
a real Nazi collaborator who's the main funder of it,
I mean, that's a direct line.
And then David Hogg's clicking his heels and turning and doing fascist style salutes.
He'll clicking?
So it's getting more and more bizarre.
And then they're banning videos or articles on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube that show that
and won't even let you upload the original videos.
It's mind blowing that we're seeing these parallels.
And they're saying, we can't do that.
And then Hillary gets up on the stage and says, Trump is attacking the press
or the press is under attack.
No, they attack Trump.
He speaks back.
That's not attacking the press.
The mainstream press is trying to get rid of free speech,
trying to shut down anybody that's in competition with them because they can't handle the truth.
The lie has to suppress the truth.
Historically, that's Hitlerian to the maximum.
Taking the guns is what the authoritarians did.
It's what they do.
It's how our country got founded was the red coats coming to take the guns.
But now, oh, you get some young adult survivors or something who come out when everybody's rights.
And so, oh, you can't talk back to them.
You have to let them do whatever they want.
You have to give up your right to them.
You have to give up your free speech.
Think about that.
That is so dangerous.
That is happening.
And the media just wants to sneak this in, kind of slide it under where nobody kind of notices this big, massive thing they're doing.
And they've chosen info wars as the poster child to misrepresent what we are,
to then sell the idea of banning people from the Internet or banning people's speech.
But notice Laura Ingram.
Laura Ingram, very smart, intellectual, good lady.
She rightfully goes, oh, look at Hog, you know, whining that he can't get into four colleges.
Which that's a pretty weird thing to talk about.
I can't get into colleges.
Well, your grades must not be good enough.
So is he like saying that?
So maybe Harvard should give you an honorary degree then.
She apologizes for that.
And of course, loses more sponsors.
Let them know what idiot publicist is advising her.
And Hog goes, I do not accept your apology.
Ladies and gentlemen, we put up a video over the weekend of him cussing and yelling and saying he hates adults.
And he's just like a super horrible thug like brat is how he behaves.
And there's new video that vice put out of him very proud.
But if we play it and say, man, this is really thug like, it'll be banned because he is the new royalty.
He has free speech.
He can call me a piece of SH, you know what?
He can call me a con man.
He can call me a piece of crap.
He called me a whole bunch of names.
But I'm not allowed to say, wow, you just picked your heels, dude, in front of a giant crowd of people.
They're shaking.
We're coming to get them.
Get us an actual taking a mile on and on and on.
And then we've got these profanity lace videos coming up next hour.
New ones where Hog just goes off for like 30 minutes like, well, he's scum out there saying I'm a crisis actor.
We need to shut them up.
See how that works?
Remember when he was on with the head of Axios on C-Span on Monday?
The Axios guy goes, there's people like M4s and Alex Jones that are saying nobody died and you're a crisis actor.
See, because Axios knows I could sue them for that.
So they slip it in there a little bit slicker.
Because with Axios and Gruber and all these guys, it's how to con people.
How do we get up here and lie and get something over on somebody yet again?
So it's the craziest thing.
You got an 18-year-old young man and a bunch of other people funded by Soros, a real Nazi collaborator on record.
Trying to take our Second Amendment, the country got started over.
And we're not even able to supposedly criticizing. That means the censorship is already here, folks.
And it's getting more intense by the day.
And then we're all supposed to conform, I guess, because then we won't have access to the Internet.
We won't have access to our friends.
That's how they get you addicted and then locked in to their Internet ghetto that Matt Rudge warned of.
Two years ago in this studio, right over there.
Such a rare interview. I think I'm going to put a plaque on the wall, actually, over there.
I almost had a heart attack when he walked in on Matt Rudge.
In one interview every couple of years, like, oh, I just won the golden ticket at Charlie's Chocolate Factory.
Anyways, the truth is, I'm a libertarian.
Anybody that really listens knows what we stand for.
They know it makes perfect sense.
And that's why they want to stand, because they can't deal with it and they want to shut you up.
I would love to see her go.
David Hogg says Laura Ingram should be booted from Fox News if changes are not made.
Wow, David Hogg says, get her off the air.
Yes, take the rights.
Just like David Hogg's got seeing in, trying to take me off the air.
And so my son this morning, he's off for Easter.
He said, I want to come into work.
I want to challenge Hogg.
My son's in the Daily Mail, you name it.
Video's gone viral of him challenging Hogg to a debate.
Almost no direction.
I wasn't even there when my son shot that.
It's gold, better than I do.
Oh, and by the way, some of the leftists are online saying, he's a child.
His father's using him.
Get him off.
Oh, I see George Soros can get people that are 17 years old, 18, have them go do what he wants.
But my real son, who wants to be on air, he doesn't get to have history speech.
Oh, I see.
Isn't it terrible how Alex Jones uses his son to go out and interview people on the street
and to then challenge Hogg?
Why?
Why?
He's a conservative.
He's a Christian.
Rex is a libertarian.
He doesn't have a right.
Why?
Don't compare the left to Hitler.
We only compare everybody to Hitler for no reason with no evidence.
When we're in in fascist uniforms with armbands, clicking our heels and turning in military leadership,
it's okay.
Don't compare it because I'm the new public figure.
I'm the new liberal Messiah, David Hogg, and I have free speech that nobody else does.
And if I want to wear skinny black ties and white shirts with dark armbands and click my heels
and get funded by George Soros, a literal Nazi, then it's okay.
Because I am the great and powerful Oz.
I am the great and powerful, incredible.
His Majesty David Hogg.
That's where we are in 2018, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, I haven't gotten to the good news yet, and I will get to Oz.
It's incredible what Syria means, why it's so critical.
Hillary, you know, and they're like, I never thought there'd be a Holocaust for Jews in America.
Now, with Trump, it's like, oh, my God, exactly.
His son-in-law is a Orthodox Jew, and he's recognizing Israel and is a Israel first year.
Oh, my God, the Nazis are everywhere.
Meanwhile, they dress up like Nazis and have them go support Trump.
Democrats get caught doing that.
Oh, that's okay.
But boy, don't you compare George Soros' little piglet.
Don't you talk about that public figure that's shaking in their boots.
They're afraid to debate me.
They said that on another show.
They're like, by the way, they're afraid to debate me.
They can dish it out, but they can't take it.
They're all shaking in their boots.
At least they're shaking in their boots.
Let me click my heels for you.
And then, if we talk about that and say, that's a little creepy.
Oh, no, we're going to have to ban you off Twitter, Facebook, or wherever because you don't criticize.
David, the savior of the liberals, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.

You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
That's Guy. It's a bird. It's a plane. It's the flaming wreckage of China's first space station.
Tiangong-1, a.k.a. Heavenly Palace, was launched by China in 2011, but it was pretty much immediately plagued by technical difficulties,
which culminated in March of 2016 when China completely lost communication with the satellite.
So over the last two years, this 8.5-ton chunk of metal has been tumbling in over and getting closer and closer to Earth.
And now, the European Space Agency and American corporations, such as the Aerospace Corporation,
say they have more or less pinpointed the exact time that it will land.
And this is within 36 hours of April the 1st. The European Space Agency says March 30th to April 2nd.
So while they've been able to more or less pin that down, they cannot say yet as to where it will land.
Because of the speed that's traveling, 17,000 miles an hour, even just a slight miscalculation or a slight change in the atmosphere
means it could land pretty much anywhere on Earth, specifically between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south
in latitude, as that is the orbital range of this flying piece of scrap metal.
Now, the 8.5-ton piece of metal is about the size of the school bus. It's pretty much impossible to accurately pin down
exactly where it will land. However, if you do want to keep an eye on it, you can go to the Aerospace Corp's website
where they have a re-entry dashboard.
Now, most of the scientists are quick to point out just what a small chance of being hit by a piece of debris is.
Most of it will be burned up upon re-entry. However, there will be, they say, a 1,240-mile-long by 43-mile-wide path of destruction
as the satellite breaks up and scatters its parts all over the face of the Earth, wherever it happens to land.
If you do happen to be in the path of this falling satellite, they say keep away from it because there is a chance that
not all of the fuel will be burned up and that the pieces that fall to Earth will be contaminated by highly toxic
and corrosive jet fuel, rocket fuel, called hydrazine.
But still, they say that the chance of you actually getting hit is about one in a trillion.
Now, that's what they say, your chance of getting hit. I don't know what the chances are of somebody getting hit.
I can say that my chance of winning the Powerball is one in a trillion, but the chance that somebody will win the Powerball
is significantly higher. However, they're not giving us numbers to determine exactly what that probability is.
However, as you can see from this diagram, there's no shortage of cities with a population over one million in the potential path
of this falling debris.
So there is a danger that this is going to land in a populated area, mostly because the Chinese lost any ability to control the path down.
If you remember the Skylab in the 1970s, that was a space station that America had crashed to the Earth after some technical malfunctions.
However, they were able to more or less control the path and try to steer it away from populated areas.
That's not an option with this satellite.
The strange thing is that this is not the first time this year that falling space debris has been an issue for China.
Let's look back to launch of the Long March 3B carrier rocket on February 12th.
Now that was launched in China and as you can see from the video, you see these booster rockets fall off.
You've probably seen that before if you've seen other rocket launches in America.
The space shuttle or other such rockets, they would typically do it over the ocean and the boosters would fall into the water.
The SpaceX came up with this brilliant idea to have the boosters actually land themselves in this beautiful sort of ballet of technology.
Well, the Chinese will not bother with such conventions.
Now, what they've decided to do is just let the boosters go wherever they happen to land, which happens to be this time on some peasants' houses.
Now, they go ahead and just launch it over a populated countryside.
That's only half the report. It's on infowars.com right now. It's powerful. Stay with us.
You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we haven't infowars live. It'd take hours.
Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
So you can upload it. And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it.
It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it.
So thank you all for remembering infowars.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
It's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. We are broadcasting worldwide. Thank you so much for joining us today.
I ended up spending most of the last hour getting into the incredible free speech crackdown happening on Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and every other leftist controlled tech giant.
And it's all over the news and new judicial watch documents. You name it about how Google, Facebook, and Twitter were merged with the White House.
They had government lavish facilities, five star private jets, everything. We already knew all that.
Google is based in old NASA bases. Google is NASA. Google is a division of the whole space command grid.
And that's the deep state. And Trump is in there and Trump is now understanding this. And Trump is now going to move on.
But Google has the NSA satellites. It has the NASA systems. It has everything.
And now look, the Washington Post is panicking. That's that's Jeff Bezos' mouthpiece.
Congress wants to drag Google and Twitter into Facebook's privacy crisis.
Gee, because they've all been doing what they've been doing just as bad.
Well, you just think Zuckerberg is the only one breaking in your cell phone and stealing all your data?
With AI computers, Google wrote the book on it. Twitter does it. Twitter reads your private messages.
Microsoft just told everybody in their terms of service, you got any Microsoft devices on your television, your computer, your Xbox, your Kinect.
We're going into your computer and we're going to read all your private messages and we're going to watch all your private videos and everything you got stored on there.
Hey, I'll give it to the South Koreans, you know, three years ago. They were more honest.
They said, we're listening to everything you do in your house. We're selling the data. So watch what you say.
They actually said watch what you say and what you do.
Android's lax app permissions may have allowed Facebook to collect users, call logs and text messages without their knowledge.
So all that's going on and you've got all these arrogant people that run the algorithms at YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and they've said you're not allowed to make comparisons to David Hogg and to fascism.
And they're now expanding it. You can't do it to Hillary. You can't do it to Obama.
And that's what I saw last night this morning. They've gone in the space of five, six days.
They started on Saturday banning anybody that compared the youth march funded by the oldest living Nazi collaborator.
Literally. You make a comparison. We're going to block you. We're going to ban you.
And now the reports are rolling in. You don't do it to Hillary. You don't because it's bullying.
This is the woman that said she came to a country she saw and he died and then hundreds of thousands died and she put your hottest in power that sell women into slavery.
She's a political operative, a criminal, huge criminal past.
But now they're saying, oh, you can't criticize Hillary Clinton now.
And that's what Hillary was getting to when she was at Rutgers yesterday.
This woman goes, my mother survived the Holocaust and I never thought it could come here, but you know, with Trump and then Hillary's like, yes, yes, and the attacks on the press are very worrisome.
Trump's not getting rid of the press's freedom. He stands up to them. They punch him. He punches back.
Hillary had Google rigging the polls, rigging the questions, rigging the information.
If you tried to search Hillary death list or Clinton crimes, you couldn't find it.
It's here. So as a culture, we have to make a big deal out of this, but I'll tell you the good news.
Trump is figuring all this out and Bezos and Amazon and Google and all of them.
He meant just left a month ago. The head of Goldman Sachs is leaving.
And you see the heads of all these other companies getting ready to leave.
And Dad's home and, you know, you had a party while he was gone and he tore the house up, but you're in trouble now.
Just because all these Democrats and globalists took over the whole NSA grid, rolled out all this spy tech system,
and think they're God and think they're going to censor everybody and think they're going to arrest all their opposition
and think they're going to have Antifa, go around and hit people on the head with bike locks,
and you think you're going to, you know, sue folks for their free speech and pay people to make up
for all the standards lies about yours truly. It's not going to work. So Bezos just lost $30 plus billion into one week.
That is a man who reportedly is so greedy that he tried to do the death over a nickel.
Who who creatures employees the worst in the United States rated.
And then of course, apples even worse, they have suicide nets and forced drugging and forced abortion
and nightmare facilities in the world.
Yeah, Dr. Evil ain't got nothing on Bezos. He's the real Dr. Evil.
I will destroy the earth unless you give me $30 billion.
You just thought $30 billion. Would you like $30 billion more?
Bezos is many me.
Well, I can't say David Hogg, he's a public figure and says everyone's shaking in their boots and that, you know,
he's going to destroy everyone. We've got profanity lace videos coming up.
But that's okay because he's a victim. So now whatever he wants, he gets, like he said,
I want Laura Ingraham out of there. I want her fired.
Hogg's like, I've already tried to get four colleges. No one's, you know.
We're like, man, that's a little complaining than a college had let you in.
Well, I guess he just deserves a degree. In fact, I think they should give him a Harvard doctorate.
And then Laura Ingraham rolls over in fear and then wonders why more sponsors are leaving
and Hogg is now pressing everything because it's not Hogg folks.
They get up there, they've got their statements. That is hand-done, controlled, incorporated, chapter and verse.
It'd be like if he was a guitar player, he's heard of playing Stairway to Heaven.
And I went, hey, you didn't write that song.
Led Zeppelin did. And they went, don't stop that bullying. You don't know that he didn't write Stairway to Heaven.
And he was like, what are you talking about?
I know hand-done, controlled, incorporated and violence policy center and Southern Poverty Law Center
and all of it verbatim out of all their mouths. It just spews out of it.
They're up there in a Jordan Soros set chanting Democratic Party slogans. That's what they do.
And it's like, how dare you say no one died and how dare you say he's from California and an actor.
And I'm like, I didn't say that. Yes, you did. Show me. Well, we can't, but we want you banned.
And I'm like, I don't even care if I did say that, which I didn't. I have the right to say it.
I don't believe a word comes out of this media. They've been caught lying and staging so much stuff.
But I think the school shooting happened from my own research and talking to other students.
I knew there was a stand-down. We first reported that.
And what were the videos YouTube took down saying I was bullying hog, saying nobody died or he was a crisis actor?
It wasn't that. It was students, real students saying there was a stand-down.
And boy, three days after the shooting, they didn't want that out in the news.
Of course, now everybody knows it. I'm going to stop and discipline myself. I'm done.
I just cannot believe this is a coordinated disinformation operation with a bunch of globalists inside Bezos' operation.
You name it. The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN trying to kill the First and Second Amendment.
And I'm not going to sit there and stand and take it. And instead of bowing to this bullying, we need to double down.
Stay with us.

They use their media to assassinate real news.
They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia,
to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding,
until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
We put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60, we put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
It's $19.95 right now.
So you get an incredible top of the line Neutropic for $19.95.
Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average, we need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the global threat of it.
But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in and I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why.
It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
It's amazing.

You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
And then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their allies within the Internet world like Infowars take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
He actually went on Jones's show and said, your reputation is amazing.
I will not let you down.
Waging war on corruption.
It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
Hillary Clinton has no instincts.
Zero.
She thought that the media should attack Trump to make him the dominant candidate.
This is in the emails, the WikiLeaks, show that he'd be easier for her to beat.
But of course, instinct wise, we knew he was the only one that could beat her.
She's so stuff-suit, so establishment, so OCD.
And then they thought, let's use Alex Jones against Trump in the campaign.
And all the numbers showed it only made Trump more popular.
And only made us more popular.
And still, it's the John Podesta playbook that was admittedly written for Hillary, The Darkheart Speech,
announced the alt-right and said, I'm the biggest enemy and I've got to be taken down and we're all Nazis.
And the same blueprint, a year and a half later, two years later, we're still under.
And they just don't stop.
And they just go with the same line.
Just like they said that I said nobody died at Sandy Hook when I didn't say that.
I did a devil's advocate debate. They clipped it.
They say I say nobody died at Parkland.
It's just, John Podesta's not even in charge anymore, but the left is still at their command stations going,
hey, Empress Hillary, what do we do? Well, the last order came in about two years ago.
We just keep repeating this stuff over and over again. Nazi Hitler banned their speech.
No one died at the thing.
Hillary didn't fall down.
Hitler, Nazi, Nazi Hitler.
Racist, racist, misogynist.
And it's so cult like you go to Hillary's Twitter, there's no men.
It's just all women and only what women are doing and how women are the answer.
And men are bad. We're a species.
Imagine if you try to see TV shows going, you know, it's the male killer whales that are bad.
Or, you know, it's the male woodpeckers you can't trust.
You'd be like, male woodpeckers, it's a species.
We don't go, you know, it's the female black widows you got to worry about.
Actually, they are the ones that are more venomous.
And they do kill their husband as well.
He ties her legs before he makes with her.
That's part of the ritual that gets her excited.
He says that he ties her legs up and then he does the deed and runs away as quickly as possible.
Well, she needs his protein, that meal for making the eggs.
But to survive on the finish, can he get away quickly without being eaten by his dearly?
Anyways, Hillary looking like a demon goblin is the best way to describe it.
Looking a bit long in the old thing.
She had a lot to say where he's at the moment.
But first, Trump, this is so seismic.
Just like last year, everybody's like, oh, Trump's going to invade Syria and he's not going to pull out
and follow the agreement that we made with the Russians years ago.
And I said, funny, he told me that no, that's a bunch of bull, we're going to get out of there.
Rep stabilize it first.
And now he's come out and he's done that and he said those exact things.
And it shows the neocons, everybody else, that have been trying to not let him know the real situation on the ground
because it is so incredibly complex.
I study it all the time and I can barely keep track of it.
But Trump sees right through it and is going with the agreement.
So we've got the President Clinton and Dempsey made five years ago with the Russians
in counter-valence of the leftist Obama shadow government.
There was basically a Patriot Deep State checkmate move where Obama was told,
we're not going to be Al-Qaeda's Air Force, how dare you Benghazi, how dare you give the missiles to Al-Qaeda.
So they rebranded ISIS to confuse everybody.
But Trump saw through that.
You saw through that.
saw through it. The military saw through it. And so now Trump these years later is really
trying to stabilize things and really trying to pull out of the country and saying we're
not going to be in the middle of this. And that is the agreement was made with the Russians
by the military blocking Obama and the globalist expansion. And by the way, the Russians said
you better make this deal because we're going to fight you in Syria. We let you do Libya.
We let you do Iraq. We know you're destabilizing everything to destabilize the Russian border.
We're not going to let you do it. And our military said, you know what? You're right.
This is really crazy. Why are we helping Al Qaeda and ISIS anyways? And history happened.
So now Trump is actually following the deal that was made that's moral. But he's also
telling Iran you sit down and shut up and you stop starting fights. And if you come back
into Syria and you try to destabilize it yourself, we're going to, we're going to bomb you. How
does that sound? He told Saudi Arabia, you sit down, you stop it, we're going to overthrow
you.
And now the backing of aliens, they go, Trump's weird. He wants stabilization. That's weird.
That was our policy until the 70s, until the mid 60s. The US didn't used to be Dr. Evil
just running around being pure evil. I mean, the Spanish Empire had already collapsed for
100 years. The US is like, we'll take it and then free market economics. But that's it.
But now we become this globalist empire. So we'll see if Russia plays nice on that front,
but there are major escalations. This is a major de-escalation and shows Trump is really
dealing fair. And it stunned the Russians that he actually said he's going to do anything.
Now watch what the globalists do. They're going to pull something, some new crisis, but we'll
see what happens. Here's what the president said about this yesterday.
And by the way, we're not going to the hell out of ISIS. We'll be coming out of Syria
like very soon. Let the other people take care of it now. Very soon. Very soon. We're
coming out. We're going to have 100% of the caliphate, as they call it. Sometimes referred
to as land. We've taken it all back quickly, quickly.
And of course, he goes into speech. We've spent $7 trillion in the Middle East. I was
against the destabilization operation that the globalists launched. Iraq, that's what
he's saying. And we're going back to the pragmatic stabilization model. And we're not going to
be part of this weird, crazy globalist operation anymore to try to put radical Muslims in charge
of Europe and Eastern Europe and Asia so you can bring down Russia with, let the Muslims
take over and have all the nuclear weapons. Is that your really dandy idea?
Let me tell you something. If the West wants to take over Russia, the West just needs to
do economic deals with Russia. But see, the globalists don't want the Russians to be
Christian or have their own sovereignty. Economically, the globalists could be in there like flies
on, you know what, but they don't want that. They want to keep Russia super poor under
their control, bring it down, and then they can have one more big run just torturing Christians
and stomping their guts out. I mean, it was like a liberal playground. American leftists,
you name it, all the world went to Russia to be part of special units where they could
just rape and murder Christians. I mean, you know that's what the left wants to do here,
and that's what they do. They always do it. They just want to get your wife and children
in a room and rape them and blow their heads off. I mean, that's what they do.

InfoWarsLife Brain Force Plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds, and
for a good reason. Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling
new tropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we
made it even stronger. Then we cut the price, because leading competitors have five to seven
times markup. We only have 150%, then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50% off.
That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill that
takes about seven days to kick in. Brain Force takes about 30 minutes, but the two go together.
It's the mind and body challenge. They're both 50% off individually, or together they're
50% off, and free shipping with the combo at infohorselife.com. But it's got to end
in a couple days, because both of these best sellers are about to sell out. InfoHorselife.com,

Hey, how you doing? Good, brother.
Just recently started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct.
Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it made a lot of changes in our lives.
Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know
I've got to have the highest quality.
Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead
of using synthetic chemicals.
We do the supermale and the superfemale vitality. Big changes, a lot of energy. We've gotten
off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a big ton of money there.
Just from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated,
or maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff, just
cover that up for a while, but then burn you out. In my experience, where stuff that gets
your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So, it's pretty exciting, and
I love it.
Visit infohorselife.com today to secure your supermale vitality and other powerful products
from infohorselife.
Let's go to Devin and Florida. Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product, and I got to say they're
amazing.
Thank you.
Anyone who's on the fence, buy it, because I've got caveman, supermale vitality, secret
swell, vitamin, and infusion. I've got the body armor.
Wow, thank you.
Wow.
You're the type of listener that makes it all possible. Which nutraceutical does you
like best?
I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
That's amazing.
That's really incredible.
I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible. I haven't felt sweet.
My morning was fantastic, and I love these guys. I love the info wars crew, and I just
want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
just buy it. We'll love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

Well, I've been wanting to get this lady on for a while. We're going to her in about
a minute. Katie Hopkins over in the U.K., but she's in the U.S. a lot. Banned off Twitter.
They want her kicked off TV. Now David Hogg wants Laura Ingram off Fox News. Because he
said, I've tried to get in at four colleges and couldn't, and he said, oh, look, you're
whining. I'm like, oh my gosh, you can't talk bad about a guy that wants to take your right
because he is a victim. Well, he's an adult. He's projecting onto American gun owners that
we did something to him. No, the sheriff's department stood down, and the guy was on
Prozac drugs, and they knew he was planning something, and the whole school said he was
planning something, and the police were told over and over again, and the FBI was told Laura
Ingram didn't shoot your classmates. I didn't. And it's wrong if somebody else does something
to then say somebody else is the blame. But I guess Katie Hopkins is back on Twitter.
I just always read about her band here, band there. Now they say, look what this woman
said. Get her off. And then I go here, what she said, it makes total sense because the
left is going into total censorship mode. She's got a new book out. We'll tell you about
that as well. She's done a lot of things like spending two days and nights on Skid Row in
London, Sissy Hunter right before the outbreak of bubonic plague. You know, that's that's
happening now. The UK banning American and Canadian activists. Oh, yeah. It's crazy.
Now they haven't started putting out child sex brochures to Muslims like they are doing
now in Sweden. But but they're very, very, very close. And now we're seeing people convicted
and folks facing prison time because they have Hitler dog. Now again, Sarah Silverman,
she can dress up like Hitler and go on TV and make jokes. John Cleese could Charlie
Chaplin could but not conservatives, not libertarians. We're not allowed to not just
have platforms. We're not allowed to be involved in humor. Only the Hollywood royalty. They
are the only ones. And if hog clicks his heels and engages in all these activities, it says
he wants our rights. And it's funded by George Soros, a Nazi collaborator. If we say that,
we need to be banned because well, that's that's because David Hogg's God, ladies and gentlemen.
So Katie Hopkins, thank you so much for joining us. We're what do you want to tackle first?
I mean, I just just incredible assault on free speech and first up Laura Ingram, you
know, one of the really important things is that you never apologize, never apologize.
It only encourages them the minute you come out and say sorry. The first thing they're
going to say back to you is, Oh, well, your sorry was too late. Oh, your sorry was only
sorry because now you're losing your sponsors. Your sorry wasn't good enough. If you thought
about what you said, you wouldn't be sorry. So saying sorry never worked. It's the worst
strategy Fox could have adopted to try and protect her. And I think what we need to
do more of is look for sponsors and commercial partners who are allies who will stand with
us no matter what our personal views are. I think it's disgusting that certain brands
like TripAdvisor or Hulu or whatever have decided that in order to appease David Hogg,
a small child, they will withdraw sponsorship from lovely Laura Ingram who's a fighter.
She's a foster mother. She's a great woman. And I think these sponsors need to be targeted
in the same way we did with Hannity and others to say, no, you are not going to decide the
agenda here in this nation. You are just a corporate making money by selling products.
Do what you do and sell your products and shut up.
You're absolutely right. But I happen to know the inside baseball on Fox and the coup they
had with Ailes and then how they got rid of O'Reilly and how they're trying to get rid
of Hannity. The Suns want to segue it into being more like CNN. They've said that they're
liberals. Look at Fox programming the rest of it. It's very globalist. I mean, look what
it does there in the UK. So it's kind of a mixed bag, but they want to act like these
hosts are getting destroyed because of their own action. And they want to be able to intimidate
their host to convince their audience to kind of do what Glenn Beck did and sell out.
So that's the process is they want Fox News to basically kill itself, but they don't want
to get the blame. And so that's why they have these corporate guys advise them to do something
which they know just like Tiger Woods apologizing will destroy them. So Laura Ingram is being
marched in front of a firing squad by Fox. Go ahead. Sorry.
No, you're fine. I agree with you. Absolutely. In fact, and many of the times that I've worked
on various outlets when I have my own radio show, you know, it's the most performing best
listened to commercial radio show. And then your bosses love the fact that you're the
best performing show that you have the most listeners. But the moment any kind of flashback
happens, any kind of, you know, horror story, a tweet that I did that nobody liked, whatever,
the bosses are so quick to run away to say, oh, no, we'll let her go. And I think that's
it. This whole kind of media, the place we try and base ourselves, you and I, it lacks
spine. It lacks backbone. It lacks the guys that employ you that say, I stand with her.
These are her opinions. We've employed her for them. We're happy with her on the good
days and we'll stand by her on the bad days. And we don't have enough platforms just like
that.
Well, that's right. And there are a lot of good people at Fox, by the way. And I know
you do some work with them. I'm sure you have your own inside baseball. It's just that that
is one way that Fox lost a bunch of its viewers about a year and a half ago, but they came
back because Fox then got more hardcore again. And that's what the people want. And it's
the truth. If you watch Tucker Carlson or watch you or anybody that's on Fox, it all
makes perfect sense. And that's why people are watching.
I think Tucker is this kind of ray of light. He's kind of my hope in that all of the media
landscape that we have, Tucker is my kind of inspiration for the sort of show that we
know Americans want. And the British people would love a show like Tucker, you know, being
on the other night with Mark Stein, with Jordan Peterson, I was bringing my report live from
Skid Row. You know, that's the sort of outlet we need where people are just telling their
truth and the American people can decide whether they agree with them or they disagree. Too
many of our media outlets seem to think we need to be able to agree to even show each
other. You know, there was never a bar that said we have to agree before we can even stand,
you know, sit at the table together. We don't need to agree to be able to share our views.
That's right. I want to go into your book when we come back in the next segment, but
getting into Skid Row, that's pretty dangerous in those dangerous places in the world and
all these leftist cities, wherever they're in control, it is just crap all over the ground,
needles, things falling apart, disease, like you said, bubonic plague, hepatitis, and you
went and spent several days in the middle of this. And then the media criticized you
for pointing out it should be cleaned up when you let these giant sores grow. It feeds into
the crime and they know the demographics. They know the history.
I think two things there. One is that downtown LA fifth and sixth, it's in the heart of downtown
and yet everyone turns a blind eye. Oh, you don't go there. You don't want to go there.
It's nasty down there. Even the hotels have covered it over on their maps with a sticker.
Like if you don't see it, maybe it will go away too. Democrats love to talk about dreamers
and sanctuary city because of course it sounds like a spa resort. No, Democrats. The reality
is this is your skid row. This is your mess. And I'm walking around ankle high in human
waste, effluent and rats. The rats there are streaming over the road. They gather around
your ankles. And my point about the bubonic plague is if you look at a description of
London in the 1600s, right before the outbreak of the bubonic plague, that is skid row now
and tears and sympathy are not going to cut it. We need military action in there. We need
to clear up those streets and out of respect for people who are truly lost, we need to
help put them into situations, residents where they can be medically looked after. We shut
the sanatoriums and we let these people drown and that's not good enough. But I also think,
you know, I wasn't that scared there. I've just come back from South Africa looking
at the genocide of white farmers in South Africa. They've only got about three years
left. We think that we'll have white farmers still in South Africa. So in a way, skid row
seems relatively friendly compared to South Africa and the white farmers that are being
killed there. And that's what's wild is I have these farmers on. You talk to them and
the president saying, we're going to take your land. The communist leader says, we're
going to kill you. The military leader says, we're going to kill you. Then they make jokes
like, Hey, good luck getting out of here. Then they say in the news that the president
did that. Well, come back and talk about it. It's just incredible. And I want to get your
take on it that it Australia's racist for offering to take refugee. So it's like, we're
going to kill you. We're going to take your land. And by the way, you can't escape. I
mean, the black racism is so horrible. Now it's like no quarter. We're going to kill
your men, women and children, and we're not going to let you escape. And if anybody takes
you to the racist, we're going to kill you. Choose to take control of your chemistry with

We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen. And I make it really easy. We went
out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy
stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula than some of

the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better.
Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60. We put $10 in it and sell
it for $30. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic
for $19.95. Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average. We need that $15, $20. We make
to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it. But I'm doing this because
we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to sell it all out before the big supply
comes in. And I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why. It's
got 6,000 plus five star reviews. It's amazing. InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com or AA-253-33139.

I wanted to get Katie Hopkins on for years and we finally got her. And she want to talk
about her book that's out. She's going to talk about topics. And every time I see this
lady, it's just everything she's saying is veritas. It's true. I cover the news every
day. I know what she's talking about. And it's what she gets into the genocide of the
white farmers that happened everywhere else in Africa is now happening again. And the
left is praising it. And I see all the crazy anti white stuff being taught at colleges
and about how whites are inherently evil if you're a white woman, abort your white baby
and major feminist magazines. And then I forgot another reason I wanted to get her on is the
assassination of Katie Hopkins, state sponsored national theater opening in a Welsh area.
And it's about killing her and she's had an attempt on her life. And don't forget all
the other nationalists that have been killed murdered in Europe. So this is next level
where Sadiq Khan is having women banned off Twitter, you know, that challenge him about
genital mutilation. And then Katie Hopkins, because she is empowered, she is strong, she
is smart. She's a woman. They're saying we want her dead and wanting to have that state
sponsored. It's just like Hillary coming out saying white women voted because their husbands
told them to. And then Hillary's in the news again yesterday. I've got a clip clip later
whenever she leaves us saying that yeah, these white women are dumb. That is the most bizarre
statement I've ever most condescending. They're saying conservative women aren't voting conservative
because their husbands told them to they're doing it because they like guns and property
and their executives and they own things and they're in charge. They're the powerful women.
The leftist women are a bunch of chicken neck idiots in my experience, just like the men.
Katie, I'm sorry, but it's true. Go ahead. A conservative women are awesome. I want women
to be powerful and in charge. That's sexy. Sorry. I know. I agree with you so much and
I always feel about this. You know, Hillary Clinton had no hope because she wanted to
play us all as victims. She wanted women to be victims, Spanish people to be victim, LGBT.
You know, she wanted to be the ambassador for victims everywhere and conservative women
like myself, white, Christian, conservative women. We always say we stand with Trump because
we stand up for our right to speak freely. We stand up for your right to bear arms. I'm
a card carrying member of the NRA right now. And I say I would much rather be grabbed by
the pussies and have a pussy for president. And I'm proud to stand there with my American
sisters because I know we're strong. Well, and again, they spun this in my whole custody
battle that I said it was okay for Trump to grab women. But the media misrepresented
that he raped women. Trump was saying like at the Elvis Presley concert, if women are
climbing on top of you, it's like, wow, they let you do whatever they want. Well, yeah,
that's the point when a woman jumps on you with both arms, their legs around you. That
means that's a mammal's mating. And so they, again, they semantically spin everything.
That's a hint that we liked you. And never, ever imagine that women are done too. I say,
screw you, me too. I've been very in control of my sexual history. I'm proud of my adventurous
sexual history. And no one's ever grabbed me where I didn't want them to. If I wanted
to be grabbed, you'd be grabbing me and you wouldn't know why, because I will have manipulated
you to do it. Women are much tougher, much stronger, much better at this game than men.
And if Trump got lucky a few times with some women with ridiculous boobs down on their knees,
go Trump. We would rather have someone sexually active who's a regular guy than some politician
who's dry humping a sheep in his back garden because he has no social life. So I stand
with Trump. I tell women Trump's not, Trump's not branding women and Alistair Crowley rituals,
drinking blood and semen. You know, he's got a bunch of kids and been married and in red
blood and I mean, and he never said he was a preacher. If he won't think that he was
Mr. preacher, and then we calling doing that stuff, he said, this is who I am balance right
there in the executive. You've got Mike Pence. So if you don't like a guy that's sleeping
with women with huge knockers who call themselves crazy names like Stormy Daniels, then you've
got Mike Pence. Look to him. He's a very straight Christian conservative guy. You've got balance
there in the executive and women like me too. Where are those women? Where are you for the
Iran women doing their protests without the burqa? Where are you when I've got assassination
of Katie Hopkins going on? Where are you for the girls who are having their clitorises
ripped off by their family members for their religion? Where are you? Western feminists
have never been more disappointing. And they want you dead because you're powerful, you're
vibrant and I'm married. I gotta say, this is pretty, you are pretty sexy. I mean, I
mean, I like women like, I don't know how to describe it, who were like, feminists want
to be tough, but they don't get like the women I grew up around or my grandmas or anybody,
you know, like kind of stomping around in charge, but not in charge as they wanted to
be in charge. They were in charge because they were alive and they were awesome. Yeah.
Well, if you think I'm sexy, I will say, I think you need your eyes tested, but I do
think strong women are really fun to be around. And the reason my government is sponsoring
a play. Well, that's what I'm saying. Look, I don't think you look bad. My point is it's
attitudes. What matters? It's you have a light in your eyes. You have light in your eyes.
I watched all these feminists that were at this feminist meeting with Hillary yesterday
and they look like they're zombies. It's not that they're even ugly. They look like something
sucked their soul. The reason the state wants to run the play called the assassination of
Katie Hopkins is because it would be much more convenient for them if that were true.
One of the things the state loves is fear. They can control people when they're afraid.
When you have someone like me who is not afraid of anyone, not the establishment, not the
state, that's far more dangerous. And they would be much better for them if I wasn't
around. So we have two jihadi sent down earlier this year because they had practiced beheading
me with a dummy, with a plastic hunting, with a plastic dummy and a hunting knife. So the
threat against my life is real. And now the state is sponsoring a play called exactly
that. What would happen if I got a poster with the assassination of Sadiq Khan or the
assassination of a black politician? How would that go down to using?
Oh, they would. It would be the biggest hissy fit the planet ever saw.
Absolutely. I would be banned from everything within a moment because it's the assassination
of white Christian conservative woman who's passionate about her country and passionate
about people's right to stand up for their country. It's seen as acceptable and in fact,
wildly amusing for the liberal elite.
Well, I've talked to some top entertainment lawyers in Hollywood and some people in Washington.
And I said, what is the point of them lying about me and saying all this stuff? And he
said, you don't get it. They're trying to create an atmosphere where Christians and
conservatives and libertarians get killed. They've already done it in Europe. And with
what they're doing with you saying kill you, that's what this is. I mean, they are literally
trying to create an atmosphere where they have this political intimidation just like
the Brown church did in Nazi Germany.
We have a situation where Theresa May, for example, our prime minister is getting rid
of Russian spies from our country or Russian diplomats because of the issue with a couple
of Russian spies being killed. You know, my message to people, if you want to stay alive,
you don't be a Russian spy. I mean, just an idea for you there. And she moans about
that.
But the hypocrisy is when they arrest someone like me or a leader of a kind of nationalist
party, they throw them in our prisons and they let the Muslims at them. We just had
that with Paul Golding from Britain first. Whether you agree with his policies, whether
you hate him, there is no reason why you should be taking a man who's known for standing
up for Britain and throw him in our jails and let the Muslims at him. They just broke
his face. And that's the way our state gets rid of and dispatches people it doesn't want.
It puts them inside and lets the Muslim population at them. And we had that with a guy who threw
some bacon at a mosque, which admittedly is a ridiculous thing. He was killed in our prisons.
He never came out again. And that's how they dispatch the people they don't want. So we
are no better than the Russians. The government dispatches people it doesn't want, just in
the same way as it's now sponsoring a play for the dispatch of me.
Well, there's also mafia rules to spycraft and the Russians probably didn't even do this.
It looks like a false flag. Why would they use a nerve agent track back to them? But
if you're a former GRU colonel and then you defect and give secrets, is it that we kill
traders, right? I mean, I don't understand that. Like, oh my God, they killed one of
our traders. I mean, that's that's again, that's upside down world. That's what they
do here. Sorry, go ahead.
No, it's fine. You're fine. I'm just agreeing with you really. I think, you know, when we
had this big hella balloon made about kind of a couple Russian spies being bumped off
or whatever, or another guy, a Russian spy that was in paid on railings or found in a
bag in his bath. Sure, that's going to happen. You know, there is retribution out there in
life if you failed your state, if you failed to stand up for your country, if you're a traitor,
probably you're not going to meet a great end. But it's a typical way of our politicians
looking away from the problems right on our doorstep and talking about something that's
much more convenient. You know, we don't address the issue of Muslim grooming gangs. We're
not even allowed to say the word Muslim grooming gang. We have to use a euphemism like Asian.
So we throw half of Taiwan, all of the Sikhs, you know, half of China under the bus just
so that we don't offend the Pakistani rapists who are raping our children. We don't want
to give them herty feelings.
Now, I don't want to get this wrong. I'm just going from memory. I'm always reading about
you banned on this, banned on that, but I see your Twitter's up and got close to a million
followers. Tell folks how they can follow you there because I'm a huge fan. People ask
what I do in my spare time. I watch the videos you're doing, others. And again, we know why
you're so effective because they want to kill you.
Thank you. So yeah, people, I'm still on Twitter. Twitter has been gracious enough to leave
me on there, but I'm capital K, capital T Hopkins. That's my Twitter. Please do follow
me there. All of my stuff is there. I overshare on a regular basis. All my reporting's there
and at Hopkins world.com. And I'm very grateful for this huge army of people that are supporting
me. And I'm going to be speaking at the first anniversary event for the Manchester bombing.
I will be there. I will be standing up there. It's another speakers corner type event. And
I will be rallying the people of Britain who know that it's time for us to stand up for
our country and to stop tiptoeing around the cultures that choose to join us and start
standing up for the culture that they chose to join. Wow. I just love this lady. We'll
be right back with the third hour a little bit more with our guest. Stay with us. The

products I'm going to use for my family. I take this. My family takes this and then
it funds the operation. But the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find

ever forget to take them, like I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent

hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. So and I know
my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously it's super female is amazing. I love it.
Nascent iodine is essential survival shield X two. If there's one product that I would
say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield X two.
It's got a five star rating. It's a win win info wars life.com info wars life brain force
plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason. Going
back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were. What
were most popular, what were best, what people liked and we made it even stronger. Then we
cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup. We only have
150% and then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50% off. That means we've got a 25%
markup and we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick

challenge. They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping

these best sellers are about to sell out info wars life.com to get your brain force plus

global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones show. All right
folks, Katie Hopkins is here and she gets me really excited because she's so on target
and I do my customary jumping in. But guess what? She's going to host the next segment
because I want to hear what her top rated UK show was like before they, you know, tried
to get rid of it because of what she was up to. But I did miss speaking sort of interviews
saying that she'd been banned on Twitter. I just remember seeing that headline and so
many others have been banned on Twitter. You're going to cover some other key topics in the
next segment and then I'm going to come back. But I wanted to ask you now, what do you expect
them to do? Because as you pointed out, they're trying to censor you. They're trying to kill
you. They're trying to block me. They're trying to censor us. Everybody else, but the momentum
is building against them. This trizan effect is taking place. So what do you think the
globalists, the global left, their, their alliance with Islam as humanity awakens to
this authoritarian threat, what are they going to do as they understand they're losing more
and more?
Well, I think what we need to focus on is not what they're going to do, but what we're
going to do. And I'm very clear about that. Now they can label us, you and I, Alex, any
other of the network of people that we know we're a part of and we don't need to see each
other. We don't need to stand in a line. We know we belong to this network because we
can feel it. I feel it with conservatives in America. We're like spiders on an invisible
web and that web is really strong. And what we do, Alex, is when they call me, all the
names they call me, they call me a racist, an Islamophobe, a bigot, a fascist, a misogynist.
Yes, sure. Okay. I'll be all those things. But guess what? Here I am on Skid Row and
here's my truth. And here's a gentleman vomiting in the street and here I am ankle deep in sewage
and here I am recovering from Hep C. And so they cannot argue with our truths, Alex. And
the more we present to them, our truth. So I spent three weeks in South Africa with white
farmers and I allow a lady to tell me the story how she was raped by three men or how
a lady whose husband was shot and then her six year old child offered her piggy bank
if the killers would let her mummy live. They cannot argue with those truths, Alex. It doesn't
matter what labels they put on you, our stories will be told and they can't silence that.
And I can feel this resurgence coming. I can feel it in the UK and I will help lead it
and I will help get our country to stop, stand up again.
Wow. I know why they fear you so much and I'm not, listeners know I don't just gush
over guests constantly, but you're so on target. You're so truthful and there is that spirit
of us that are nationalist, that are free market and the those that love communism and
socialism, they just seem like their soul sucked. I'm not just bashing them, just to
bash them. They have existential envy of anything strong and good and want to pull it down when
they should have the instinct to try to be strong and good themselves. But there's something
twisted in them and you can't seem to get them to unflip the switch.
No. And so what we do is we do better than them. Leave them there. Leave those bitter
women over there complaining with their pussy marches and their banners. You know, I watched
them on the pussy marches and I asked them, ladies, tell me, why are you here? And one
would say, well, I'm here because of global warming. And another would say, I'm here because
my vagina is made of steel. And another one would say, I'm here because I voted Clinton
and this is not my president. And it was like, ladies, you don't even know why you're here.
And very much like the Parkland school kids, you stop them on the march for our lives and
say, why are you marching? Oh, we need weapons banned. Why are you marching? Because people
were shot. Why are you marching? Because I really like David Hoff because I like emancipated
boys. Okay, fine. Again, no unified single mission, no clear aim. I think conservatives
have a very clear aim. We want to make America great again. That's a clear unifying aim.
And in Britain, I want to make Britain great again. And I have a clear aim. And I think
that's where the left fail. And it doesn't matter what they do, carry on, ladies, bitch
about our president, whatever. I know we're stronger. I know we're better. And I know
we're about working hard to look after our families. And that's a fundamental value.
And the thing with fundamental values is they endure. And that's why we will endure too.
Oh my God, I'm in love. What about the audience? I got to get this lady on more and she didn't
want to plug it about her book, rude. You can find it online. You can also follow her
on Twitter. She's going to host the next segment. And then I'll be back after that. A real treat
straight ahead. Katie Hopkins hosting the info war.
I'm so excited. The new product that info wars life.com in a glass bottle, two month
servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Bull. This is a
heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulus in it. But boy does it stimulate
because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people
$100, $200 for the formulae. And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists
and developers non GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add
the preglin own to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to
even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at info wars
store.com and your purchase of the operation live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting
and welcome back here to the Alex Jones show on info wars. My name is Casey Hopkins. I am
not Alex Jones. If that isn't immediately apparent to you, that's a concern to me.
I'm hosting this segment for Alex while he's just popped off to do something. And I thought I'd
like to take this opportunity to update you all on some of my journeys and some of my thoughts
over the last couple of weeks. I just came back from three weeks in South Africa. You know,
one of the things that have been worrying me and troubling me, people email me all the time,
and you're very welcome to email me to my email is Katie at Katie Hopkins.co.uk.
Hey, and I had so many emails from farmers, white farmers in South Africa, particularly
their wives worried about the genocide that is happening there. Essentially, and the gentleman
you can see there is the leader of the kind of terrorist arm, I would say, of the ANC. When
you think about the ANC, the political party leading South Africa, they're headed up by a guy
called Cyril Ramaphosa. He stood there in his state of the nation address a few weeks ago,
and he said, we support land expropriation without compensation. And what that means,
of course, is we're going to take back your land, and we're not going to pay you for it.
And when you translate that by the guys in those red berries that you see, they were the guys that
tore apart the H&M stores when you saw those rioting pictures. Those are those guys. And
their rallying cries at political forums, their rallying cry is kill the boy, kill the white man.
That's how they chant. And in Parliament, they've been making throat-slitting gestures
against the opposition. Now, if you think about that, the footage you're seeing right there,
that's the EFF supporters, the terrorist arm, as I call them, of the ANC, rioting in H&M. And
you'll recall that was about a sweater, about a monkey, and they used a black model for it. And
they tore those stores apart. And that's how they do politics in South Africa. It's a very violent
way of doing politics and how this is translated by the white farmer means. And this is kind of
brutal. So if you are easily upset, this is brutal. But the people I went to see, they've been attacked,
they are being cleansed from the land. Farm attackers come into their building. If I think
about Bernard, he came back with his family on a Sunday afternoon after a bar, and he was going to
make a barbecue, a bribe for the family. A black gang were waiting for him in his garage. They
strung up his wife with wire. They clubbed to death his father on the floor. Then they took
Bernard's and they hurt him so badly he didn't know if he was being stamped or not. They shot
at his 11-year-old son and the shot missed, but the boy was dragged across the yard and his little
brother was watching. And his little brother sat in the garage door and watched the whole attack.
He watched his mother strung up. He watched his father, grandfather killed. And he watched his
father take a beating so bad the guy didn't walk. And after all of this, you know, we imagine that
that is the worst that can happen, but it's not. I sat on Bernard's stoop with him in South Africa.
And I talked to him about his children and this children, this eight-year-old son of his who was
a brilliant boy at school. Everybody loved him. He was everybody's favorite child. Now he cannot
sleep anymore. He's a tortured little boy and he has anti-depressant and he has sleeping tablets.
And Bernard even went back to the doctor and said, I'm sorry, I think you've given him the wrong one.
Please don't work still. He can't sleep. And the doctor said to Bernard, you go home and take
one of these tablets, his son takes four. Bernard took it and he was out to the camps.
But that's what happens in South Africa. They're destroying not only the white farmers who will
be cleansed from the land within three years, but they're destroying a new generation of children
who are also persecuted and tortured because of what they've seen done to their family.
Recently, they took a white baby and they threw it into a bath of boiling water.
An 86-year-old lady, while I was in country, they broke into her farm. They plugged in an iron that
they used to iron clothes and they applied it to the old lady for three hours. And that's what
we're up against and that's what the world doesn't want to talk about. I think, you know, sometimes
racism, we think it can only happen one way. We think it can only happen if you're white. Only
white people can be racist, but that's not the case. In South Africa, because of apartheid,
the EFF has given a mandate for vengeance in that country. And that vengeance is so cruel.
That is the rape of a child in front of the farmer, just to take away every last thing he
has before they shoot him. And because they are white, the world doesn't care. You know, I've
often said the white farmer in South Africa is up there with the white rhino. You know, they both
face the extinction. The white rhino, we just lost the last one. And the only difference is,
the only difference is that because it's a white farmer, the world doesn't care.
And that's what I found so upsetting. And that's why I'm building my documentary now with rebel
media. And that documentary has footage that nobody else had, because we went to the darkest
places to find that. I have interviews with a police officer who says that the police work
hand in hand with the black gangs. They help equip the black gangs. They give them the firearms in
order to take a kickback from the farm attack if they feel something. So the policemen are in on
this. I also got an interview with an actual farm attacker and asked him why he felt it was
appropriate that they could rape three-year-old children in front of their dads. And he said,
well, apartheid. It's time the white people learned their lesson. So that's the real truth,
my truth from South Africa. And I would urge you and encourage you to be involved in that
story. Look at the reporting. Look at the facts from places like Africa 4 and with the statistics
on what's actually going on in South Africa. This year so far in 2018, there's been 103
farm attacks and 15 murders. And you know, having told you that behind every farm attack,
there's a child. There's an eight-year-old. There's Bernard's son who can no longer sleep
anymore and has been asked to leave his school because he's now a violent boy. And there's
Maryandra, another beautiful lady I met, whose husband was shot. He died as she buried her
husband. And she gave birth to her first son, his first son, five days later.
Maryandra's daughter, who saw the whole attack, she can't sleep anymore either. And she's on
antidepressants too. So these are the people we want to bring home to. Those pictures you're
seeing there, that plasmord, that's a massive, it's a monument to the white farmers who have died.
And when you go there, it truly is, it breaks your heart because suddenly the individual stories
get lost because there have been so many, many murders. I walked to the top of that mountain
and stood next to that sign. And it's almost as if in death, you know, these people still
stand together in the fight. And that's the way I see us, you know, as conservatives,
as Christians, as people who want to stand up for their country, whatever label you have,
libertarian, apolitical, whatever. If you identify as a frog, it doesn't matter.
What matters is that we stand together. So we need to reach out our hands to each other.
And even if we disagree a little bit, we don't need to agree on everything.
What we need to agree on is the fact that we love our family. We want to work hard for our family.
We love our country. We love the people who want to stand up for our country. And then we stand
together, you know, like these spiders on a web. Sometimes I think conservative commentators, you
know, are big failing. The thing we do wrong is that we chase the story. I see an end to it as
well. Like my son, I've got a nine-year-old son. And when they play football, it's really, really
cute. But they all chase the ball together. They all move around in this little group, all chasing
the ball. And that's very much like mainstream media right now. They're all chasing the same ball,
the same easy story, a story where they don't have to leave their office or risk themselves or risk
their health. But we need to be better than that. We mustn't chase the ball. We must look for the
hardest stories and tell our truth. It really matters that way. And so I encourage all of you
and the thing you can do tomorrow, the action that you can take, start looking for the quietest
stories. Go to your local council offices. Go to your local member of parliament. Go walk through
Skid Row. Go find the things that matter. Tell your truth and let's join together. Hold each other
on this web that we have and we stand strong. Disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high

InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen blocks.
We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory functions.
In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting,
chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and
effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts
by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
Man, I was just thinking about this song five minutes ago.
Oh, Murrell Haggard. That's like a cool mountain spring.
You're thirsty. Crank it up a little bit.
Yeah, they're walking.
You see, the average American that has no idea what goes on behind the scenes,
people try to take this country down. And George Soros, people ask why talk about George Soros
so much because every time I kick down another door, digging into this thing, it's him on the
other side of it. He's got a other group of closely knit globalists and billionaires, but man,
he is just crazy. You imagine being 14, 15, 16 for three years in Eastern Europe and helping
round up Jews because they trusted him. He was Jewish. He was young, looked a little bit younger
for his age. Looked like he was about 12. He wrote a memoir about it. People don't think as a child
is threatening like the children, oh, turn your guns in. We're children. We're children.
And, you know, we've got the 12 minutes, 60 minutes interview and McBrain did a great job
putting together with Hitler clips. But there's one part we says is the best part of his life.
We don't even have that in the clip we play. You know, I think I'm going to air.
I think I'm going to make a documentary about George Soros. I haven't made a film in years.
Just about, I'm not going to say killing George Soros, like killing Katie Hopkins,
because only the left gets to make movies and plays about killing the opposition. I don't want to
kill George Soros. I just want to expose him. And I know in a bunch of the lawsuits they filed,
they'll always have a quote about N. Jones claims George Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
They just put them in the lawsuits, Georgetown and two others as a message. Hey, George, I know,
I know you're coming after me because I keep saying you're a Nazi collaborator. These guys don't get
it. See, if the Nazis told me, go round up your fellow Jews or we're going to kill you,
I'd kill them. That's why the Nazis don't run Texas, boy. We don't roll over like you.
I think high level Hollywood folks years ago go, we really want to put your movie in theaters.
You can make like $5 million dollars. George Soros had to do what he did. He's really not a bad
guy. And I talked to somebody close to him and would you ever want to talk to George Soros?
And I'm sitting there and I go, is that an offer? And they're like, do you want it to be?
And then I had another TV movie star on one time.
And he just brought that up during a break. He said, you know,
Soros's sons are not that bad. You know, you ought to stop calling him a Nazi collaborator.
You know, he did what he had to do. So I mean, I get it. Soros has reached out. Well, but, you know,
hey, here's this option, Alex, or there's this option. Hey, Soros, fill your hand, buddy.
Fill it again. I will never sell the truth out. Got it? Ever. And the reason I keep
announcing that is they still haven't figured out that I haven't gotten the message. I got the
message. It's refused. Return to Cinder. No such number. I'm not ever selling anybody out.
And it's not because I'm a hero. It's because I know God's real. See, Soros, I fear God. I don't
fear you. And I know you wrote that book and you gave interviews, Shang. I knew I was the Messiah
when I was a young man. But they lock you up for that. So I didn't want to tell anybody until
I've shown everyone. Oh, you're showing us. You're showing us your son tweets photos of him
at spirit cooking events in the middle of the spirit cooking controversy. Alexander Soros,
your aid to camp, your air, your protege, your chosen one, that thing with crazed little demonized
every photo seething with the insanity. That is your warmock. That's your battleship. That's the fruit.
I mean, you're not a tall cold drink of water yourself, but your son sure as hell ain't.
God, oh my, look at you. Finally found some people you couldn't intimidate.
Finally found some people you couldn't push around.
Finally found some people they're going to roll over to your crap. Yeah, that's what you found.
And I noticed I didn't really, I'm learning so much more like exponentially now because
you just get the knowledge and then it all starts connecting and that's the wisdom.
You know how people operate and how these groups operate. It's like it is criminology.
And when you pull back from it
and you study it and you look at it,
it's amazing. Then you see the whole thing at that point
and you see their plans and everything and it's the people's unconsciousness and their inaction
that allows this stuff to go on. It's the weirdest thing. I like grass the whole thing
and then it's like I'm not supposed to say it because it's not time for it to come out and
then it wipes and I can't even tell you. It's the craziest thing but wouldn't Soros and all the rest
of them like to know, wouldn't they? But I didn't know what was going on. A year and a half ago
we exposed the spirit cooking and the Aleister Crowley stuff and then they were all bragging
about it everywhere and then they all sort of tweeting and celebrating the high priestess
and I'm just like oh oh oh oh oh she's great look at her oh oh oh like this is your god this crazy
woman and then you realize how weak these people are. They sold out to evil because they're scared
and that's what it is fundamentally and they don't understand I'm not scared. I'm not
and they know that and they can't stand it because if you're tied into the spectrum of their
their system you pick up on the mental illness and the confusion it's like it's like having the
flu or a fever it's like hallucination it's real broken up and not that it's the opposite of the
that still quiet place of the most high that Psalms talks about
and then you realize oh my god they're all just totally confused and don't even know what they're
doing. They see order and want to pull it down because they're disordered and then you're like
do they even realize the shadow of the huge mountain they're next to that's God?

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Depeche Mode. Incredible band. Love them.
See them at concert three times. Horribly politically dumb. The song, John the Revelator,
if you read the lyrics says that Christians stole their faith from the Jews and you could argue
that and then stole it from the Muslims. Crank it up. Here, I see it right here.
What did John the Revelator say? You know, people think PK Dick wrote stuff in the 70s and 80s that
came true. They're like, wow, this guy's a visionary. John the Revelator
had a, what, three, four day hallucination and envisioned everything that now has happened.
Mark of the Beast, world government, giant pillars of fire explosions,
describes jets, helicopters, computers, robots.
I mean, a book of lies. How about an incredibly amazing hallucination
that, that became the blueprint of what happened regardless of how you look at it.
That's bizarre. He stole it from the Muslims. Oh yeah, they didn't exist for 600 years.
That's a fact to Pesh mode and that's what I mean about the left. Everything they say is BS
and I'm sick of it. They call us fake news. No, we're the opposite of fake news
and they know it.
You imagine me in a jury, let's say David Hoggs sued me for comparing the youth march to Hitler.
He's a public figure. It's thrown out on summary judgment. But imagine,
imagine, I think they still might do it though, because they just get to put whatever they want
in the suit and it's protected defamation in a suit. And so they just put it out. They're like,
Jones has been sued by the surviving children because he said no one died. That's what they do.
Hell, that's in the suit Georgetown filed. I'm like saying Hogg will sue me. It basically is the same
group. In between when he's trying to get Lord Ingram off the air, the first of him it took.
By the way, has my son tweeted yet? He wanted to come to work today. He had this idea of a video
he was going to shoot and I just don't know. He's off in there and doing it on his own. I'm sure
it'll be great. My God, I think he put out there that was a better one I do. That's why they're
really upset right now. Soros's son can hardly talk. It's like, I'm really proud of Rex. But you know
what? He's a man now and I had to talk with him last night about this because he wants I tried to
talk him out of doing this. But I said once he made the decision that he wants to fight the globalist
for real and he's really a man now. He's always wanted to do this. He was reading like adult
history books when he was like 10. He understood and we had to talk last night about this and about
how this is serious and that he wants to go down this road. Another gladiator in the fight for
liberty just came out on the field, ladies and gentlemen. I can feel it. In newspapers all over
you name it, the enemy is upset right now. They don't like it. Let me tell you something. My son
at 15 walked in there. A few notes I gave him, a few ideas I had. 80% was him. And then he even
did the basic edit and Rob do fixed a few things. I mean, that is incredible. That is amazing.
US senators can't talk like he can at 15. But the truth and the spirit and those eyes, the will,
because he knows what he's pushing up against. I tell you, powerful Jedi.
A new apprentice, younger and more powerful in the face of the globalist. Thank God.
Man, God gave me a son right out of the gates. Boom. That's my whole life's like that.
So blessed. I just thank God. I'm just on my knees constantly in my spirit. It's so miraculous.
It's so good. I am such a wicked person. And to be given all these blessings and to be
transcended and to be purified and to be sanctified minute by minute by the blood of Jesus is amazing.
It's incredible that the, you know, these attacks are just elevating our discernment,
our connections, our will. And as the globalists throw everything they've got at us,
I know why Trump's high as a kite and leather as well. It just, Trump says, I've changed. I've
changed. I wasn't bad before, but now I love Jesus. I understand. And people that know him,
that's why they're really freaked out in the White House because it's like Trump is now like
the Holy Ghost is with Trump. And of course, he's the president of the United States,
put the globalist after him, trying to turn things around. I mean, this is epic.
This is incredible. And I've got all this news to get to. I just have it because it's just such
an amazing time to be alive. And I'm so proud of my son and I'm so proud of my daughters.
I'm so proud of my wife and I'm so proud of this crew that puts up with all my crap
and everybody else. I just, and the listeners, you're just so incredible
because you're not just listeners. You're active. You are the blood of this country
and the blood of the world. You are the energy. You are the force. You're the mind. You're the
soul. You're the body. You're the will. You're the wind. You're the rain. You're the storm. You're
the sun. You're the moon. You're the trees, the clouds, everything that ever was. We're just here.
We're conscious. And then you look at the people that serve the globalists. They are so broken
and so twisted and so evil. And we want to feel sorry for them because you have to understand
they don't feel sorry for you. They want to destroy you, period. I mean, Hillary looks like
someone out of a horror movie. And I'm not just because she's old. I look at old people that
have a soul that shines through like a light through, you know, window pane or stained glass.
The person has a beautiful soul as they get older, like an old gnarled tree. There's something so
beautiful about it. But what evil people as they get old, all that's there is that demon
shining out, grasping, arrogant, twisted, imbred, mentally ill. Hillary's dad was a Chicago gangster,
an enforcer. I mean, she's just a genetic whack job.
And you look at her and you just say, boy, I don't want to be separated from God.
I mean, she looks like Emperor Palpatine without the makeup.
And she's so sick mentally, but also physically, she has to mount incredible will
to even go out and give an hour long speech. All that will for what, lady?
It's all about you, isn't it? All right.
Who's hosting the fourth hour? I've got so many clips that are so critical.
And Joe Glibert's coming up and I've done 30 seconds of plugging in two hours today and
they're like explaining, we will go bankrupt if I keep doing this. Hey, here's the deal,
we got the best products out there, really good prices and everything you need. And then
Patriot apparel and books and films and bodies, ultimate timber formulas back in 25% off and
about to end the special on brain force and the real red pill challenge. You get them both separately,
50% off or together, 50% off, but together you get free shipping as well in four store.com and
four is live.com or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And it is how you find
the operation. But what's even cooler is to get a t-shirt and all the great folks you'll meet,
all the people you'll meet that are awake and what's going on and every order gets a bunch of
bumper stickers dumped in there. And we have the new shirt of the month. When tourney becomes law,
t-shirt, it's the 3% really liked that shirt. So I got that 3% shirt and you sign up and get it.
You get 25% off or you can buy the shirt just each month. They're all limited edition is the
point. And so all of you out there thinking about us and standing with us, you're what
empowers this whole thing and puts the wind in our sails. And you've got the commitment from me
that you can tell we're never backing down. We're never giving up. My body will break,
my will might break, but my spirit will never break. And we will make it through this. And
the globalist will be destroyed. They already know that's why they want to take us with them.
They already know they chose this wrong side. We've taken thousands of years of known research
and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds
from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer.
It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family. And you owe it to
the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as
focused as you can be. Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your
prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield
and infowarslife.com. We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen. And I make it
really easy. We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy
for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula
than some of the best-selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and like,
look, what is the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it
better. Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for 60 bucks. We put $10 in it
and sell it for 30 bucks. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top-of-the-line
new tropic for $19.95. Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average, we need that $15,
$20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it. But I'm doing this
because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to sell it all out before the big supply
comes in. And I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why. It's got
6,000 plus five-star reviews. It's amazing. InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA-2533139.
InfoWarsLive BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by Leaps and Bounds. And for a
good reason. Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling new tropics were,
what were most popular, what were best, what people liked. And we made it even stronger. Then
we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup. We only have 150%.
Then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50% off. That means we've got a 25% markup.
And we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in. BrainForce
takes about 30 minutes. But the two go together. It's the mind and body challenge. They're both
50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLive.com.
But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out.
InfoWarsLive.com to get your BrainForce Plus and real red pill today. You know, if I tried to sit
here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWarsLive. It takes hours. Michael ZX Plus
now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the
yeast, the mold, the candida. It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids. So you can upload it. And our
latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste
is super blue silver immune gargle. That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement
with iodine, a super high quality silver and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank
you all for remembering InfoWarsLive.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already
awake, but it's other people that aren't awake. It's so essential to spread the word. Again,
thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
I don't want to say I dropped the ball today because I got distracted by a bunch of stuff
going on behind the scenes. Man, I should have got to all these clips.
Jeez. Congressman FBI report says Andrew McCabe lied four times about media leaks under
oath. Of course, he's a criminal. Well, just because he looks like a kindle doesn't mean
you know most of the real psychopaths actually look like kindles.
But the people always get in the car with them. The women think, oh, he looks like he's a nice guy.
That is a Clinton criminal. And this crap about, oh, you're putting the FBI down. The FBI letting
people like that run it is the problem. You are absolutely destroying yourselves. It's amazing.
All right, let me get into the clips I said I was in place. These are important.
Here's this vice hit piece. I'm not going to hear the whole thing. It's 10 minutes long.
It's on info wars.com. You want to see it? But they go horrible people are saying kids are actors
and that no one really died. And then they show people that have that viewer saying it.
And that's their right to do. That's their first amendment because the government's
lied so much and that lied about babies and incubators against the Iraq war and girls that
were kidnapped for the Panama invasion and that no one was kidnapped. And now, oh my God,
two Russians got nerve gas. We don't have any proof the Russians did it, but let's have nuclear war
because of it. I think the shootings happened. I think that stuff went on, but then they grabbed
people that were Democrats in the acting department and for PR to put out the anti-gun message.
That's admitted now. Okay, you're anti-gun. That's your right. Okay, you got with political
organizations. They're using you. That's a fact. But I don't want to retreat from this thing of like,
well, I didn't say they're crisis actors, but other people have that right. But they mixed
me in with all them in a 10 minute report where you're already emotional and mad and pour a little
hoglet and everything. And then, oh, there's that Jones. And it's just all part of the
newspaper articles every hour. I can't even keep track of it. Jones says the kids didn't die banning.
You know, when are we going to get rid of this free speech thing? This is the end of free speech.
We're the test case. And now the left's running around saying Jones is using a son. He's a child.
He shouldn't be allowed on air. So you can have everybody else can be on air and all these other
students can be on air with their anti-gun. But now because you can't censor my son off air,
the new thing is why Jones is telling him what to say. Actually, well, somebody run over there.
We got here at like, you know, 10 o'clock, he's been over there. Did they put out the tweets
from Rex? I don't know. He wanted to challenge hog on my Twitter. He wanted his own Twitter.
And I said, I don't know yet. Use mine. And it's all my son doing it. I don't even know what he's
done. So somebody find out or go to real Alex Jones. Oh, it's on screen. Thank you. So he has
done it. So there you go. You know, he's a man. He's 15. But just like the Democrats can say,
we're all Hitler and do jokes where we're Hitler and all this, we do it. We get banned. Oh, well,
my son, he shouldn't be allowed to be online either. Well, he's just a baby at 15 says that
David Hogg, you were a public figure who has viciously attacked my father and others for
nothing more than criticizing you. You and your CNN buddies are currently trying to take our YouTube
channel down. Why are you so against free speech? That's good. And I did see do about an hour ago.
And I said, Hey, if Rex is tweeting, make get into Laura Ingram and how hog wants him banned,
that was my little two cents. And he goes, Oh, we're already on it. He already knows about that.
So see, Rex is already, it isn't like he's saying what I say, he's already synced. He already gets
it. It's like, well, now hog says, get rid of Laura Ingram. She's like, okay, in the, it was
Easter weeks up. Okay, you said you can't get into college. I said, Oh, where are you whining
about it? Okay, I apologize. The interest is being nice. He's like, I want your job.
Well, my God, if hog wants your job, you better tell him he wants her
sent to Mars, we better do it. And he was going to send some other tweets out. Is that the only one?
No, no, but he was going to send out multiple tweets.
There was a whole, there was a whole, I was there with him this morning in the car. He was like
writing the tweets he wanted to send. Cause I'm like, let me check what you're going to say.
And I'm like, no, don't call him a name. I mean, my two cents was you'll be a little nicer.
So I guess that's he didn't send out the other tweets he was going to send. Okay, whatever.
So there you go. That's how I'm directing him. I'm not directing him. I just said, you know,
my one critique of his video was don't say crawl back under your rock, even though he's calling
me names and all that. I said, don't go to his level. But you can see, I didn't, I didn't,
I didn't even pre-look at it. They just put it out. So that's how much I'm trusting my son right
now. I mean, I'm giving him two cents, but then I'm walking away to see if he executes. And he is.
So there's a new video. Let's hear that the next five minutes. We download the new Twitter video
he put out. I guess he put a video out too. So we'll find out about that. Okay. So I'm back on
the hog thing. Here he is on vice, just part of the tirage. And then it cuts into them misrepresenting
what I say. Here it is. We've had to learn to deal with these sick f***ers that are saying this stuff
that are out there claiming that we're not real people, claiming that we're actors.
We don't get f***ed what you say.
Television is the David Hogg channel now. He's on everywhere. And I know scripted PR when I hear
it. One of them went into a bathroom in the same, I believe in the same hallway as the shooter.
One of them went into the same bathroom, I believe, as the hallway shooter.
That's called a sound bite. And I was resaying my sound bites to sound as eloquent as possible.
I wasn't reciting my lines. I was reciting my heart. I mean, it is incredible, though,
to watch fake news in action. I mean, this, this is how you murder the truth. And I don't know if
David Hogg understands this. He probably does it. I tweeted the lovely man that is Alex Jones.
I wanted to come on and actually debate him. But then I realized some of the stuff that he was
saying, which was the exact same stuff that he said about the Sandy Hook survivors,
saying that they were actors. Then we see footage of one of the reported fathers of the victims,
Robbie Parker, doing classic acting training where he's laughing and joking. And they say,
hey, we're live. And he goes, oh, maybe that's real. I'm sure it is. He's doing that exact same
stuff. And knowing that you had done that before, I wasn't going to give him time and day.
We didn't say you were a crisis actor and believe this happened. We just pointed out that you're
an admitted actor and journalism student and said that you're anti-gun and that you're being fed
talking points. Alex Jones was probably the first one that created the narrative of Sandy Hook
victim dies again. I'll stop right there. And no, I didn't. And they had a picture of children
killed at Sandy Hook in Pakistan at a bombing. And I just said, the web was reporting on it.
I said, you know, that's probably just a PR group that's just seizing on the bombing and
just printed up some pictures. And I'm sure the Islamic bombing really happened. Just like
they're trying to misrepresent what I say now. And like, oh my God, Alex is being mean to the
people. These are the folks telling you that I said no one died at Parkland. They don't have a video
of it because I didn't say it. But there's hog going along with the John Podesta scripted stuff
Hillary put out that Jones is saying the exact same thing about me that he said about that.
No, I didn't say that about them. I didn't say that about you and you know it. And that's why
the clips they have are not even me saying that. But they tell you I said one thing and
then have to show you something completely different. I don't even know what level of
propaganda this is by vice. But David Hogg is in a man's world. David Hogg is public. David Hogg
is doing all this now separately. Again, you can't compare this to Hitler or they ban your video.
But the left calls everyone Hitler and everyone racist but them. It's crazy how they operate,
how entitled they are. You know, I've got some of these clips here. This is Hillary Clinton
moderator at Rutgers Invokes Nazism while talking about America and Hillary. And then Hillary goes,
oh yeah, we don't want Trump attacking the press. When Trump fights back, that's free speech.
It's the left controlling the press. It's the left calling for us to be banned.
It's the left calling for Trump to be off Twitter. You're the censors publicly. You think we're that
dumb in this mind control? Where you're censoring us. You're attacking us. You're calling for this.
You're doing it all over the world. And then you say we are. And then she has this condescending
look like attacks on the press. And you look at the crowd of women. And it's like a weird
whack job cult of chip on their shoulder. People that just want power and want to run stuff,
but they can't run their own lives. Here it is. As someone who grew up in Vienna and barely escaped
the Holocaust, my mother would say from time to time that it could happen here. And.
And hit pause. Back it up again. George Soros. In the WikiLeaks wants to overthrow Israel.
Look it up. Jerusalem Post. George Soros worked for the Nazis and was proud of it and said best
time of his life he'd do it again. 50 minutes. And then you've got a Jewish lady talking about her
family. When George Soros is the main funder of Hillary, it's just too rich, man.
God almighty. Just go back to her. Just go ahead. As someone who grew up in Vienna and
barely escaped the Holocaust, my mother would say from time to time that it could happen here.
And I was, I would be very dismissive of that. I would dismiss it and I'd dismiss her comments
and her fears as implausible. By the way, hit pause. We're going to come back and break
pause. We should take this video and put it with Antifa hitting people in the head. The
Democrats calling for killing people and, you know, plays that call for killing conservatives.
You know, the, the, the, the assassination of Katie Hopkins. I mean, we should just
narrate it to that. Hashtag hunt Republicans. All of it.

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Well, I was thumbing from Montgomery. I had my guitar on my back.
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow eyed. He said it's a long walk to Nashville.
Would you like to ride, son? Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones,
coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
I sat down in the front seat and turned on the radio and them sad old songs coming out of them
speakers was solid country gold. Then I noticed a stranger was ghost white tear when he asked me
for a light. And I knew there was something strange about this ride. He said, he said,
can you make folks cry when you play a song? Have you paid your dues? Can you mow the
can you bend them guitar strings? Ladies and gentlemen, the Daily Mail and many others have written about Rex
going on air and challenging David Hogg to a debate. Well, my son came to me.
I guess it was Wednesday night, Tuesday night, and he just said, man, this hog guy, I'm sick of this.
He was like, look at this article. They're saying that you
challenged Hogg to a debate and bullied him, but he challenged you. He said, dad, I want to debate
that guy. I said, Rex, well, that'll be a pretty big story. If you do that, you can get some good
points out about the Second Amendment. I said, what do you want to do? He kind of gave me his idea.
And I said, write it down next morning. I got up at six a.m. He got up about six a.m. He was going
to jujitsu before school, grabbed an Uber and he gave me his list. I said, yeah. And then I guess
it was the next day then that he came out for school. But the point is, is that
that all these publications are coming out saying in the same article, they talk about Hogg,
that I have thrust my son into politics that I am this terrible father that has done this.
Alex Jones turns to his 15-year-old son to defend him from bullying by David Hogg.
Yeah, the bullying's tongue in cheek. David Hogg called me a piece of, you know what,
and said I'm a scammer and all this other stuff, and tried to get my YouTube channel shut down.
That's a violation of the First Amendment. But we just point out he's the one by their yardstick
bullying. He wants to be able to jump out, oh, I'm a victim. Oh, I'm a child. Oh, but, you know,
you're all shaking in your boots and F you. So I'm going to read over some of this when we come
back. But this is just look at the size of this article. It's like how many pages long? I mean,
I just read like five pages during the break. 34 pages long.
And then there's like some implication. I'm violating a court order having my son on air.
And I'm already at the lawyers in contact with YouTube. So I'll just go ahead and get into this
now. That's what's going on with my ex-wife is there'll be a gag or the judge lifts when the
trial was over. But then she'll take a thing and send it to YouTube saying that that just happened.
Look, look, there's a gag order talking about the court case. I don't talk about it. My ex-wife
talks about it constantly. But she takes one video I do with my lawyer explaining, no, I
didn't lose. It's 50-50. And here's my lawyer. So there's a gag order yet that was lifted after
the trial. And to be the same thing here, she got an injunction not once, but twice when Rex was
13 and 14 to not be on air, which the lawyers don't think is constitutional, but I didn't
buck it. It makes you want to be on air even more. And now the injunction has been up for almost
nine months. And I said, okay, you want to go on? And I even called the lawyers. They said, no,
there's no, there's no injunction. It's open. But then I realized, because that's already being said,
Jones violated an injunction and put his son on YouTube. Van Alex Jones immediately. And like
the left, they never think another step. People are going to go, wait a minute. His son is six foot
one already has arms as big around as mine. And I'm like a gorilla. Because some of his
grandfathers were big, my dad's little. And he got, he's got a mustache. He grew a mustache in three
days. And all these leftists get to have their kids all over the world. But I can't see because
I'm an American. I'm a conservative. I'm a libertarian. And we don't have speech.
It's a long hard ride, but it's worth it, isn't it? That's right. Going to warn you. It's a long
hard ride. We'll be back. Stay with us. Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut

or call 1-888-253-3139. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
Well, the left is apoplectic, they're panicking. You can hear the bugle call the calories here,
Rex Jones. And they're like, I was reading this Austin American statesman 30-something page article
and I got to admit Till Love is thorough, but he kind of goes back and forth. He says something
really isn't accurate. He says something that is accurate, but I guess that's how he gets away
with writing the statesman. I think secretly he's a listener or something, but he's got it down here
where he talks about David Hogg being incredibly off-putting. I just had it and I can't find it.
Well, I will admit that I find Hogg's arrogance off-putting and unsettling.
Yeah, he can get a career in Hollywood acting like a supervillain. I mean, there's a certain
little gleam in the eye and he's like, and they're panicking and they're afraid of debaters and we're
got them shaking and they're like, oh, yes, they would give us an inch. We take it a mile, little Mermaid,
sign the contract. He's like, I have you now. We want your guys rule, communist take on it.
I love it. I mean, who do you think the global is going to groom and get all polished up for this?
They got to be just as bottom feeder as they are. So kill love has to admit that Hogglet comes off
like a power tripping megalomaniac. I mean, let me tell you something. When you're clicking your
heels and doing fashion salutes on national television, you got a problem. You know, put me away,
put me out in the pasture. If I ever want to get up from a crowd and click my heels, turn sideways
in a military salute and then do a fashion salute. Just the optics, you only do that when you are a
control freak maniac. And the left cuts in Trump and me with Hitler everywhere. But if we do it,
we're the worst people in the world that'd be banned because Hogg is God. Hogg is God. Hogg is
God. Hogg is God. Hog, Hog, Hog. We love Hogg. King Hogg. Lord Hogg. Master Hogg. King Hogg. Lord Hogg.
And then you got Hillary up there financed by a 89-year-old famous Nazi collaborator who went
on 60 Minutes and confessed to it and said, he wasn't sorry, and it was quote, the best time of his
life. Even the Nazis at Nuremberg were like, we're very sorry, please. George Soros was like,
I really enjoyed it. And I'm going to roll out Hillary in front of you to strut her stuff,
bulk, the wave of evil behind her. And I'm going to complain about Hitler in America.
And you look at the anti-Israel vitriol. And I used to be on the fence about Israel because it's
just another country. Until I realized the left sacrament is hating Israel and working with the
radical Islamists and they want to overthrow it and Soros documents came out. And then I watched
the leftist Jews loving Soros. It's the craziest fruitcake level stuff I've ever seen and calling
everyone a Nazi who isn't a Nazi. And then Arnold wears a death-said SS officer belt in Heavy Metal,
the part they cut. This is in Rolling Stone. He said, I love Hitler. His dad was an SS officer.
His brother was a product of an SS marriage. He was born after World War II. His brother
that died in a car wreck. And I just know all this stuff. I mean, I've read the Rolling Stone
interview. The 80L gives him an award. In Pumping Iron, that's why he bought the films they wouldn't
release on the DVD. He would tell the black people they weren't human and then take
their black girlfriend from them and have sex in front of everybody's inactive dominance
and say, I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger and I am in the bestiality. That is, there's film of that.
Of people talking about and Arnold's like, you bet I do. Black stars human. And the 80L is like,
God almighty, can we get you an award right now? He's like, I wear that Hitler belt. I dress in
SS uniforms and play Hitler records when you come to my home for dinner. I told Maria, you only wear
dresses. Hell Hitler. But see the left lifestyle, that's a fetish thing with Hollywood and all those
old guys like Nazi stuff. It's come out in the news like all these old Hollywood guys are just
collecting it and loving it and they're like telling their black girlfriends, well, you can't
have any black boy friends. I love that. Well, you're Jewish. And that's it. There's like a Hollywood
Jewish Nazi cult. God, these people are evil. Jesus. It's devil worship. They like anything bad.
Communism, Hitler, it doesn't matter. I want to be famous like Hitler or Jesus. I like Hitler. I
admire him. And then I get to sit there and watch it. Rutgers, an old Jewish lady going,
I'm afraid Hitler's going to get me. Sweetheart, Hitler already got your cupcake.
You're sitting there with the most powerful known Nazi connection there is.
That tentacle, just like, you know, the demon in it has a tentacle that uses the clown,
tellerizes the tongue of the anglerfish. That's what they are. It's like a little,
and so it's like a dying robot, but it's still, it's animated only by pure Luciferian energy.
And you're sitting there next to Hitler's weapon. I mean, literally, direct control by the spirit
of that. And you are next to a Satanist and you're afraid of Hitler when the Satanists are flipping
out over Trump and he's backing Israel. You're an idiot. God almighty.
Headline, Jones attacks daughter of Holocaust survivor for fighting Hitler.
You're all idiots for following Hillary. She is manifest evil. Let's play the clip.
I've been saying I played all day. Let's play here. Start over the beginning with the woman
of scared of Hitler, scared of Trump, and then Hillary about how there's an attack on the press
when she's the one doing it. Here it is. As someone who grew up in Vienna and barely escaped the
Holocaust, my mother would say from time to time that it could happen here. And I was,
I would be very dismissive of that. I would dismiss it and I'd dismiss her comments and
her fears as implausible. I now find it shocking. I'm even about to ask this question, but I do
want you to talk about what are your concerns about the stability of our democratic institutions
and structures in these tumultuous moments and what for you is head pause again.
Hillary announced two years ago the attack on the first amendment and called for us to be banned
and called me dark heart. Got inverse that name. Go back to her of American democracy.
Well, I am. I'm fundamentally optimistic and hopeful.
But I don't think that optimism and hope is warranted unless we do what we're supposed to do
as citizens. Which is me on the payroll of a Nazi collaborator. I worry about the degradation
of institutions, the dismissing. That means they're criminal networks and values.
Because she has the values. Oh, she just fine. She. Oh, we're in charge. It's like pretend
princess land. We're in charge and everyone's bad that us and fantasy land. Yeah, let's go back to
her together by trust. You can disagree with somebody. But at the end of the day, you have a
common interest in how we make decisions. You have an awareness of the importance of facts
and evidence on which to base those decisions. So they just say facts and evidence. They have
these signs and awesome black lives matter. Science is real. It's like we own science.
Science is real. And we're mad about it. Keep going. She said she goes and there's an attack
on the press. Absolutely essential role of the press. And you protect that.
But you're you're the ones destroying it. And you look at these women. I mean,
look at these pseudo intellectuals. Go back to the video. Look at their slaves.
They're not even bad people. They don't have 10 brain cells put together.

From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
All right, my son, Rex Jones, is tweeted at his lordship, the one that cannot be criticized,
even as he cusses at us and calls his names, Lord Hogg. I hope everybody retweets him from
real Alex Jones. And I have the, oh, do we have the video? Did you guys download Rex's new video?
From Twitter? That's a, I love you guys so much, but I want to be able to go to our guest,
so I want to be able to play that. So I want to get that new video that Rex tweeted out because
I want to play that on there. Can we do that? Okay, great. I know I babble a lot and it's hard
to listen to everything I'm saying, but I saw the tweet about 20 minutes ago and they got it done.
I haven't seen the video yet. So it's on real Alex Jones, where he says basically,
he said he was going to challenge Hogg and say, why haven't you debated me and why are you responding
and why are you calling for the end of the first amendment? And then I, that was this morning we
talked and then later Hogg came out and called for the firing of, you know, hosts that criticized
him off Fox News. So it's just a rampant attack. Look at me. I'm a victim. Give me your guns,
give me your free speech. Give me everything. You hurt me. You attacked me. I'm a victim
and I didn't attack you. If somebody runs over you with a car and then you go on the news and say,
you can't criticize any of my political views, because somebody ran into me with a car. It's,
it's, it's leftist buffoonery from the establishment.
So it's on real Alex Jones on infowors.com and we will play it. Now, Joe Gilbert hosts every
Friday does a great job, but he knows part of doing the $4. Sometimes I go a little,
little, little berserky. So we're going to get to him in the next segment. But like I said,
as soon as I have that Twitter, not trying to be OCD about it, I've just asked a few times,
they have not uploaded it yet. Okay. I saw the video in the article. That's what I need to know.
Thank you for that piece of critical, amazing Intel. Thank you. I see, I told Rex, don't make it a
big production. Just do a live, you know, two minute deal, but he's doing something different.
So we're going to see what he does. But again, major news articles, Jones shouldn't allow his
15 year old baby on air. It's abusing him why children can't be on air unless they're David
Hogg and then they can do whatever they want. There it is from the Dawsonburg estate. So now
it's Jones turns his 15 year old son in offending from bullying David Hogg. There you go, ladies
and gentlemen. So David Hogg is the cause celeb that we must fire lower anger. We must give up
the first amendment. We must give up the second amendment. We must Mr. and Mrs. America, turn
them all in or you are a child killer. Turn in your guns, killers, turn in your guns. It's time to
repeal the second amendment or you're a child killer. Boy, that's not authoritarian. That's
not outrageous. That shouldn't make you mad. People looking at you and telling you because
you have a right. It's your fault. You didn't know that when somebody stabs somebody with a knife,
every knife owner is to blame. You didn't know if somebody poisoned someone with
any freeze. If you have any freeze in your car, you're a murderer.
You didn't know that if a jihadi runs over somebody with a truck and it happens to be a
Ford or Chevy, you got a Ford or Chevy. How dare American Ford and Chevy owners. I'm going to
do a man on the street. I'm going to go out in parking lots and I'm going to approach people
like CNN bullies people and I'm going to say, sir, ma'am, what in the hell are you doing? You are
driving a Mercedes car. Did you know a Mercedes truck was used just last year in Berlin to run
over a bunch of people? And again, months before that at a Christmas event, what are you doing
driving this killing machine? They'll be like, well, I'm not associated with that. I didn't do
that with the truck. It doesn't matter. You have this deadly assault vehicle that killed hundreds
of people in Nice that find out the model of the truck in Nice. And there'll be some US subsidiary
and I'm going to go around and I'm going to get in people's faces. I'm going to say, what in the
world are you doing driving a brand vehicle that was associated with running over 270-something
people and killing over 180? And they're going to say, that's the person driving the truck?
No, no, no, you are the killer. You're a murderer. And if you criticize me, you don't care about
those toddlers run over to Nice. You murdered those babies. Now, I want you to kill yourself right
now or I'm going to say, I'm so, so you right now. Every car owner in this country is responsible for Nice.
You murdered those children and you don't even care.
Yeah. Yeah. Now let's go back to it.
Every car owner, every truck owner in the world is a murderer. You murdered children in France,
in Germany, and in New York. And I want all vehicles banned. I agree with the Supreme Court
Justice. I want to repeal the Second Amendment. I want to repeal everything. What kind of vehicle
is that? It was a rental car? Home Depot trip. I can't tell because the front smash.
Is that a Chevy? Is that a Ford? Ford to Chevy, still a last 10 years like they should.
They're zooming on that. What is that? Is that a Chevy or is that a Ford?
Not that it matters, but can you believe that Ford or Chevy? We got some car buffs in there,
right? Can somebody tell what that is? What is that? Is that a Ford or a Chevy? A Ford.
There you go. Ladies and gentlemen, should there be lawsuits against Ford for this?
Just like other manufacturers, should there be lawsuits against Home Depot?
Should they? Absolutely. They knowingly let somebody rent something
that the truck then went out and did. It's like Christine. You parked that truck there,
it starts up, it goes and kills people at night, it pulls back into the bay.
All right. Well, he's coming up. Joel Gilbert straight ahead. Now I'm going to go find out
what's going on with Rex Chard challenging Lord Hoglett. Oh my gosh, I can't just call him Hoglett.
Oh my gosh, I got to be banned off the internet. Sorry. And then all the rest of the news.
There's a lot of clubs as well.
Hillary Clinton Republican Party's being held captive, yeah, by the voters.
And we've got to Hillary Clinton. The Russians are still in our elections.
And we've also got a Trump on the tyranny of gun control and saying it's not going to happen.
And oh, George Ramos is eyeing returning to Mexico.
Well, there's some pretty places in Mexico, but they're all heavily controlled,
like Elon Maheros or a few others. So George, if you hate America so much and it's so racist and
it's so bad and it's so evil that we have less border control than Mexico, don't let the door
hit you on your booty when you go out. Oh my God, I just bullied an Hispanic person,
banned me for that. But as we speak, they've got newspapers all over saying Alex Jones is
exploiting his 15 year old son and holds him captive and makes him say pro gun things.
Now we just accused Jones of saying that, you know, any scripting doesn't exist,
but we're going to accuse him of that now. And we hope his son is removed from YouTube immediately
because after all, no conservatives are allowed to have a voice because we're liberal and we're

infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
eye comfort and respiratory functions. In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people
who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
of this research a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack
of our pollen block chewable tablets.
InfoWarslife is launching its newest product. We're really really proud of it.

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from Los Angeles right
from the left coast. Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones store and get Trump the art of the
insult. 95 minutes of laughter and you'll get to know Trump. You don't know Trump until you've seen
this movie in the Alex Jones store. I want to welcome my guest it's Dr. Herbert London a former
candidate for governor of New York. He heads up the London Center for Policy Research. It's also
known as a think tank. They do research on key policy issues including national security and
energy and I want to welcome Dr. London on to info wars. How are you today?
It's a pleasure to be with you. Thank you very much. Can you tell our audience what exactly does a
think tank do? What does the London Center do and how do you influence policy in Congress and even
the White House? One of the things that we attempted to do is of course introduce policies
that would make sense for the United States. We don't have any particular partisan agenda.
Our goal is to see whether in fact there are policy issues that would be appropriate for the
United States considering the fact that during the Obama years we did not really have a foreign
policy. So again the way in which we do that we talk to people on the Hill. We organize seminars.
We try very hard to insinuate our ideas into the Trump administration which we have done
so much successfully and so it's always a question of trying to use whatever leverage you have
in order to influence the course of history. Okay so let's start with what do you think led
to the meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Trump and what do you think will come of this
meeting? Well as far as the catalyst for it it's very hard to say but my own feeling is
what you have is a regime that is desperate absolutely desperate. Keep in mind that the
GDP of North Korea is about a billion dollars. The GDP of South Korea is more than a trillion
dollars. There's no comparison between the two and it's also true that what you have in Kim Jong
Un is someone who's a third rate fourth rate dictator. The very fact that the president of
the United States would meet with him lends prestige to North Korea. They've won the first battle
but it seems to me that Trump is engaged in a high-wire act and he may turn out to be a very,
very successful wizard turning that wheel behind the curtain. There's no doubt in my mind that what
we have here is an interesting set of events. You have North Korea that has nuclear weapons
but they have nothing else, nothing else in the country. It is dark, it is dank, it is dimwitted
but you have again a South Korea that could provide an awful lot. The very fact that Kim Jong
Un can no longer provide for his own soldiers, can no longer provide for what is necessary
even for the very, very modest introduction of economic reform into the country clearly suggests
that he is amenable to some sort of negotiation. Now, upon Trump one of the things that I would
say the first thing is make sure you get two guarantees before you get on Air Force One,
deluclearization and unlimited, unlimited verification. You get those two things that I
think is appropriate for the president to start engaging in negotiation. After that we can talk
about aid, we can talk about, I don't know, even as many pork bellies as necessary to feed the
population but nothing should occur until those two guarantees are put in place.
Okay, Herb, how do you feel about Trump's tariffs? Will these, how will the tariffs on
steel play out and does Trump have a valid point on national security?
But one of the things you have to understand about tariffs, by and large tariffs are a tax
and I don't like taxes by and large. I mean, overall, it's not very good for the consumer.
And if you're talking about an unfavorable balance of credit, it's a question of what happens to
that unfavorable balance on your side. Do you spend the money adequately? Do you need it for
other industries? Does it create jobs? Very, very difficult to say. So tariffs as a generalization
has to be seen within a certain kind of context. The other point that I would make about this
is that when you're talking about this, the president has already engaged in backsliding.
He is saying now we will negotiate with the Chinese on the $60 billion. So it wasn't as if he said,
you know what, this is blanket reform. We're going to introduce this. He is going to start
a negotiation with the Chinese about the $60 billion. Just as he has already said to the
Europeans and to both Mexico and Canada, we will keep you again outside the realm of this
tariff regimen. So I do think that even though he's imposed these tariffs, we are already seeing
that the president is moving away from them. Okay, look, Donald Trump has criticized nonstop
about his lack of expertise during the campaign and on all the cable channels, of course,
that aren't Fox for the most part. How do you assess his foreign policy successes so far?
And is he really lacking in expertise or is he all instincts and maybe good instincts in the end
of the day? Look, I think that this president is not an intellectual. He would probably admit as
much. But his instincts happen to be very good. And what we have found on the foreign policy front
is that the president, I think, has probably done quite well. If I'm giving him a report card,
I would say probably a B and I'm a tough grader. But I think it's important to understand that
what he's inherited is a very difficult set of situations across the globe. And the president
has to react to them. Most of the nations that were once allied with the United States lost
confidence in America during the Obama years. And he has to restore that confidence.
That's not an easy task. Whether you're talking about C.C. in Egypt or the crown prince in
Saudi Arabia or even Abe in Japan, the president has to reach out to our allies and convince them
that the United States is a dependable ally. Not an easy task, but something that I think he has
done quite well. Well, you wrote a book called Leading from Behind the Obama Doctrine and the
U.S. Retreat. How bad and how much damage did Barack Obama do to the last 50, 60 years of foreign
policy consensus that asserted and projected American power around the world?
Well, Joel, I think you understand this matter very well indeed. But what you had with Obama
was this naive belief that the arc of history was moving in our direction. And it's a consequence
that was not necessary for the United States to engage in any form of intervention, whether it
was military intervention or even peaceful intervention, that the United States was going
to opt out of foreign policy. And so we saw a continual and, I must say, incremental withdrawal
from international affairs. That is one of the reasons why Trump has this difficulty.
If you create a vacuum in international affairs by the departure of the United States,
that vacuum will be filled, very often filled by bad actors. Those actors could be ISIS,
they could be China, they could be the Iranians. But there's no question that that vacuum will
be filled. We have to understand vacuums in international affairs can be very dangerous.
Therefore, American participation is necessary. That doesn't mean that we have to play the
role of policemen in the world. I do not believe that for a moment. But it does mean that the
United States' diplomatic activity is critical in dealing with international affairs.
Okay, we've got about another minute. How do you feel about the personnel changes and the
direction that Trump is heading? We just changed out McMaster for John Bolton at the National
Security Council. Does that make you more comfortable and more optimistic that he's
heading in a direction that will secure America's allies and defenses around the world?
But I know John, I think he's terrific. I think there's a great move on the part of the president.
As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the key moves that have been made by this presidency.
I think that John Bolton has the imagination, as well as a kind of understanding and experience
in international affairs, to make him an ideal candidate, a national security advisor.
I'll tell you, I'll tell you a story very, very briefly. Years ago, when I was the president of
the Hudson Institute, I would hold my watch. We've got about 10 seconds. Let's get the story
at the top of the next segment after the commercial. We'll be right back with Alex Jones showing info.
We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy. We went out
and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy stamina,
mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling
formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and looked, what is the top? What is the best?
We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better. Leading competitors put $2
a product in it, sell it for $60. We put $10 in it and sell it for $30. It's $19.95 right now.
So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic for $19.95. Believe me, we're selling it
for $35 on average. We need that $15, $20. We make to fund this operation in the face of
the global threat of it. But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in. And I want people that haven't tried
BrainForce to try it and find out why. It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews. It's amazing.

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
Welcome back to infowars. Joel Gilbert coming to you right from the left coast. We want to
finish up with Dr. Herbert London of the London Center for Policy Research. Herb, we wanted you
to share a story about one of your experiences when I asked you about the NSC. But this is a story
about John Bolton and it involves a colleague of mine at the Hudson Institute, Robert Pork,
who you may remember was converted into a verb, Robert as fast as mortal coil, but was a great
friend, an extraordinary jurist, perhaps the finest jurist in America, former solicitor general,
and at the same time someone who taught at Yale Law School for several years, several decades.
During that period, when he was at Yale Law School, he taught every power elite individual
in Washington D.C. Whether it was Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, John Kerry, I mean, you go down the
list. There's probably no one of note who didn't study constitutional law with Robert Pork.
During the course of lunch, I said to Robert, you know, tell me about your students. And he said,
you know, I've taught everyone of any power or influence in Washington. And I said to him,
who is the best student you ever had? He looked at me and he said, that's easy. I said, that's easy
based on all the experience that you've had. He said, yes, by far the most intelligent, the most
imaginative student I ever had at a Yale Law School was John Bolton. Now that's high praise.
That's that's high praise. That's a fabulous story since he's coming on only in a few days.
Dr. London, thanks for being here and appreciate all your insight to all the audience here at
Infowars. Thank you. Always a pleasure to be with you. Thank you.
Okay, folks. Look, I want to talk about how this week Donald Trump went after Amazon again.
In the tweet, he said they pay little or no taxes to state and local governments and they
use our postal system as their delivery boy. And they're putting out many thousands of retailers
out of business. So what I want to do today in this last segment is let's look at what and who
is behind Amazon. Could it be the deep state or what I call the police state? Let's look at some
facts. Did you know that Amazon was not profitable until about three or four years ago, they were
only breaking even or losing money because they low ball their products. Amazon had very high
revenue and no profit. What changed three or four years ago? Well, what changed was CEO Jeff Bezos
became a mega billionaire and the richest man on the planet. And his stock price went up to $1,500
per share because of the deep state. In 2013, Amazon got a $600 million contract from the CIA
to create a computer cloud service. That was the whole difference. That's what turned Amazon around.
In fact, it was an insider deal between Amazon and the CIA. IBM had to sue the government
because the CIA broke the law that requires open bidding for government contracts. And guess what?
IBM lost in court a judge named Thomas Wheeler, who later upheld Obamacare, ruled in favor of the
CIA. And you know, you wonder why. So later that same year, Jeff Bezos buys the Washington Post
for $250 million. This is a guy with no cash except for the $600 million that the CIA gave him.
And Business Insider Magazine wrote, Jeff Bezos didn't waste too much time before signing the $250
million deal. Bezos said, I did no due diligence. I did not negotiate for the Washington Post.
I just accepted the first number they proposed. So Bezos buys the Washington Post with the CIA
money, a leftist newspaper, favorite of the CIA, publisher of leaks. And essentially half the money
he got from the CIA, he turned around and unquestioned bought the Washington Post, which often
quotes unnamed CIA sources in their reporting. Of course, the Post doesn't disclose that the CIA
paid the owner of their newspaper twice what it cost to buy the newspaper for a website. Remember
Obamacare website, they paid $2 billion. So who was the CIA director when this deal with Amazon,
the Washington Post was finalized? It was John Brennan. John Brennan, the corrupt CIA director,
the political operative, the Obama campaign advisor. He's been a loyal progressive Democrat
since he voted Communist Party in 1976. So wouldn't you like to see an investigation into the
collusion between John Brennan, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, the Washington Post, and the CIA?
Now, Brennan was in the news again this week in his new gig as a MSNBC analyst. Let's see what
Brennan had to say about Trump on video just this past week.
He is mean-spirited. He is dishonest. He has shown a lack of integrity. And he has continued to,
I think, to be in the office of the presidency. Do you believe he's somehow in debt to the president
of Russia? I think he's afraid of the president of Russia. Why? Well, I think one can speculate as
to why that the Russians may have something on him personally, that they could always roll out and
make his life more difficult. So here, John Brennan is exposing himself as a political operative.
You can only imagine what went on at the CIA with this guy's leadership. But it's very rich that
Brennan thinks the Russians might have something on Trump. Brennan's guy, as you know from my film
Dreams for My Real Father, Brennan's guy, Obama, by his own admission was raised by a Soviet agent,
Frank Marshall Davis in Hawaii. And there's a mountain of evidence that Davis is Obama's real
father. The Kenyan student was just a sham marriage. Now, you wonder how that would play and how
Putin could control Obama by exposing his real background because his father was a Russian agent.
Let's look at an excerpt from my interview with Malik Obama from a few years ago where he talks
about Frank Marshall Davis. Frank Marshall Davis, fairly well-known poet named Frank Marshall Davis,
who had moved to Hawaii. Frank Marshall Davis. Do you think that Barack looks like Frank Marshall
Davis? This is a man that he said raised him. There's a great resemblance. Yeah, I think Frank
Marshall Davis and Barack, they look alike. Some kind of bulls I see on his face and Frank, he has
those two. There's a resemblance. And does he resemble your father? Not really. I don't, you
know, they say about the years and no, no. So here we have Brennan continuing the Russia, Russia,
Russia narrative that somehow Trump was colluding with and is controlled by Putin. But the only
thing that explains Obama's pro-Russia policies, especially during his first term, was because
Obama was controlled by Putin. Don't forget Obama removed the missile shield from Eastern Europe
that Putin desperately wanted out. Of course, the famous reset that ended up transferring all this
technology that was forbidden to Russia, the U.S. approval of uranium-1, transferring our
uranium deposits to a Russian company. And as Herb London spoke earlier about how Russia's
number one foreign policy goal to get America to retreat from the world so they could fill
the vacuum of power in Syria and Crimea in Ukraine, Obama implemented Russian policy
called leading from behind. So everything indicates that this secret of Obama's that was very
dangerous for him to take to the White House put America in jeopardy that his real father was a
Russian agent. Let's look at the video of Obama and Medvedev in that context when they were speaking
before the 2012 election. A few months ago, when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical
threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaeda, you said Russia. In the 1980s are now calling
to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War has been over for 20 years.
You know, I transmit this information to Vladimir. That conversation between Obama and Medvedev
should have led to an immediate special counsel and talk of impeachment. It wasn't a scene from a
movie. The American president was begging for time saying, if I just have a little more time when
I get past the election, can you get me some more time and I'll do your bidding. And Medvedev says,
I stand with you, I will transmit this to Vladimir. That should have been a special counsel. So the
United States has just wasted all this time and energy on this ridiculous probe of Trump
when I think all this time the person who was controlled by Putin was absolutely Barack Obama
and that's the only way you can explain his pro-Russia policies. Everyone please, if you haven't
seen it, check out Dreams to My Real Father. Of course, Trump, the art of the insult in the
Alex Jones store. It's very important to buy it from the Alex Jones store only to help support
Info Wars show. Trump, the art of the insult. Thank you everyone for being here. This is Joe
Gilbert right from the left coast at Info Wars. Thanks for being here today.
They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that
their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to
endorse the resistance. All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and
sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and
airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding. Until the only option left is for the police
to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for
their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom
is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association
of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
