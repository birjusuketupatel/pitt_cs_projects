Reaching the Conditioning!
InfoWars comes to mind.
Alex Jones.
Alex Jones.
Alex Jones.
There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body count story.
That's according to website InfoWars.
It's probably confirmed there are recent shooters with fully automatic weapons.
Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
JFK was shot from the back and the front.
It was almost as if this was a planned impulsion.
It just panicked.
They took the babies out of the incubators.
I'm not going to jump in without a cold bath.
I think this is a national security imperative.
We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
Operating in areas that we can't control.
UFOs.
Is this global governance at last?
Is it one world?
The central bank is in charge.
Israel claims the fact was accidental.
Some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
Russian stuff.
Denied everything.
He called it all fake news.
And he accused CNN of being fake news.
This is a national emergency.
If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
This is a female high-level emergency.
We are at war with Russia.
Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and which leaks?
The White House and the president are citing info wars.
They can shut us down.
You're next.
If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
It's Alex Jones.
Okay, if you go to info wars.com or news wars.com, you'll see the headline memo release developing.
And then you'll link to a story we have that's basically a placeholder.
That's what the Washington Examiner has done, which is fine.
They basically repeat what Congressman Gowdy has said and what Congressman Nunes has said, Chairman Nunes and what Congressman Gates has said on the show.
And exactly what we've said is in the memo, but they announced it's being released.
But our sources said about 15 minutes ago that it'd be in the next hour.
So as we speak, it is going out and it's whoever scans it first and puts it up on the internet first.
I don't care either way.
I just want to get it out very, very, very quickly before they stage some false flag or something because they have been in full panic mode.
FISA memo leak McCabe admits FBI used bogus steel dossier paid for by Hillary to obtain FISA warrant to spy on Trump.
Now, what did I tell you the memo was based on the memo that was declassified by the FISA court reporting three times that they believed what the FBI was asking for.
The Justice Department was asking for was illegal and that is indeed cited in the memo.
That's the big tamale.
That's the big enchilada right there.
And this is just a roadmap and the House officially saying you had an insurance policy.
You had a secret society.
You met with McCabe to fix the intelligence, the deputy director.
You went on and on and on and on and on with these attempts and never stopped, never back down and just kept pumping the lie about all this.
And so now the media is learning the details of what's in the documents and they're printing me the articles as fast as they come in.
If you're driving down the road, you're 18 whaler listening to us, you know, you're at the gym or whatever.
We will we will we will read out all the information as it comes in stocks or spook.
Outfalls 400 points from a tax integrity, the FBI, the Justice Department politicized probe in favor of Dems memo released dot dot dot developing dot dot dot details details.
That is the drudge report as the media scrabbles and talks to members of Congress as the memo begins to go out.
You will then see the articles developing.
That's not what we did when the former head of the NSA pointed out that, hey, this this whole memo, except for the excise parts is in plain view.
We just posted the whole thing.
But what a lot of media will do is as they get it, and I think it's clear that some of these Washington based groups that are on the hill now have it.
They are writing articles about it instead of just publishing the memo.
So the race is on to publish the memo.
Check our email.
I know Watson's on stones on it.
We're told it's becoming in any minute and just post it directly the second it comes in.
Frank in North Carolina.
Thanks for holding so long.
Go ahead.
Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
It just gets old now.
I'm going to shut you down right now.
Okay.
We're taking calls about your nomination.
Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm if that was happening to anybody else?
I'd be freaked out.
I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
Is that what you want, Frank?
You know what, Alex?
Hey, I'm going to pause again.
Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
We're under attack.
We need your help.
As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
You understand?
I need your help, Frank.
I need your help, Frank.
Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the Info War.
Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
Free press needs your help, Frank.
Ladies and gentlemen, dredgerport.com, infowars.com, newswars.com are all on the cutting edge right
now as the memo in the last 20 minutes got released by Congress.
But it's been released to media sources that are on the Hill first, and I guess they decided
to write articles about what they've got in the memo rather than just put the memo out.
But it'll just be minutes, we're told, 10 minutes to an hour until it is posted on the
House Intelligence Community website for the House of Representatives.
So the House Intelligence Committee will be publishing that.
We're told by Congressional sources in the hour, and that was about 20 minutes ago.
So we will be following that, and the second it gets published, the memo itself, we will
publish the memo, and we will read the memo.
Obviously, a lot of media outlets have run with memo released, and then you go and there's
just placeholders.
That's what Fox News has done, it's what True Pundits done, it's what Washington examiners
done, and that's fine.
We've done it as well at infowars.com.
But as we add to the article, we're giving some of the backstory of last week when we
published, to get media attention, it was on the Director of National Intelligence own website,
got no media coverage, that there was a 99-page document, and that the excise parts are the
roadmap of who called for it, who did it, and so that is now indeed reportedly in that
memo as we said.
But we know it is horrified the Democrats, let's go ahead and go live to the President
or we can back it up to where it started, the President is discussing the memo released
on Fox News right now, so we will go ahead and go to the President.
He's declassified, Congress will do whatever they're going to do, but I think it's a disgrace
what's happening in our country.
And when you look at that, and you see that, and so many other things, what's going on,
a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, and much worse than that.
So I sent it over to Congress, they will do what they're going to do, whatever they do
is fine, it was declassified, and let's see what happens.
But a lot of people should be ashamed, thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
You figure that one out.
I don't think so.
These are just great people that have suffered incredibly, there were many, many others like
them that have suffered so much, and they were here and I said, let's tell you a story
very quickly, we have others in a different room as I told you that are really petrified
to be here, petrified.
So it's tough stuff, it's tough stuff.
Mr. President, do you believe there's more United States to do, how more afraid of petrification?
Well we're doing a lot, we've done more than, I mean we have many administrations that should
have acted on this a long time ago, when it wasn't at this kind of a, when we were in
this kind of a position, you know, we ran out of road, you know the expression, the
road really ended, they could have done it 12 years ago, they could have done it 20 years
ago, they could have done it 4 years ago and 2 years ago.
We'll come back with more if it gets into the memo, here's the issue, as we told you,
as Congressman Gates told you here on this broadcast and as other congressional sources
told you, it is a roadmap of Congress and of the Intelligence Committee saying we found
that they premeditatedly lied, made up Russian collusion, created a fake dossier, paid money
for it and we have witnesses, we have FBI agents that are ready to go public, the Steal
Dossier formed an essential part of the initial and all three renewals of FISA applications
against Carter Page, the media thinks you're dumb, they spend it, who cares about Carter
Page and a wiretap on him, because that FISA memo isn't a classic wiretap, it's to spy
on millions of people in a dragnet, that's what they do with these FISA situations.
Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought from the FISA court
without the Steal Dossier information, yeah the word is McCabe is singing like a canary,
the political origins of the Steal Dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials
but excluded from the FISA applications, oh they didn't tell them that, the DOJ official
Bruce Orr met with Steal, remember his wife worked at Fusion GPS just for the job, she
just got hired for the dossier, beginning in the summer of 2016 and relayed to DOJ information
about Steal's bias, Steal told Orr that he Steal was desperate that Donald Trump not
get elected president and was passionate about him not becoming president which is more communications,
more witnesses in the FBI, not just text messages now, not just him talking to his girlfriend
or somebody talking to his wife or not just Orr talking to his wife at Fusion GPS but directly
talking to McCabe and others about this situation and how they wanted to stop Trump.
So the president says a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, it's beyond that,
they're trying to steal our election, they're trying to steal our votes, every vote for Trump
they're trying to overturn it, breaking Trump on newly declassified GOP memo,
alleging FBI abuses, a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves, there's no alleging,
you have the text messages, you have the FBI agents that are now talking to Congress and
this is just the beginning as Congressman Gates and many others said and as I told you last week
from our sources that it's the roadmap for a public indictment, the House indicts
in an impeachment as well, so this is a public indictment and then now it gives the president
and others room to move against them, the Democrats know this was all political, CNN and MSNBC know
it was all political, they know what this was all about and they are scared to death saying it's
the end of America, it's the end of our democracy, it's the end as if the FBI and Robert Mueller are
the government and everybody else doesn't matter and if political appointments like Robert Mueller,
Democratic Party operatives who protected the Clinton crime machine, if they want to step in
and use a made up dossier about Trump being urinated on and then leverage that into claim
that there's some perjury somewhere or there's some obstruction, when they're the ones lying to
Congress there was no leaks, come he told Congress I didn't leak, he directly then later said oh I
gave it to a friend in the press to leak it, oh you gave it to a professor of journalism to leak it,
it's the same, it's like saying if I hire somebody to go kill somebody and then I'm on video telling
the person here's $10,000 now go kill this person and they go kill the person, I am just as guilty
or more because I generated it, it's murder one, I didn't pull the trigger, you didn't pull the trigger
but you gave the order, this is open and shut and come he's like well I told Congress that I never
leaked because I didn't, I gave it to a journalist friend, uh-huh, you gave it to a professor friend
of yours in the journalism school, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, did they give it to the Washington Post, oh okay
and then McCabe got caught leaking, so they have really made some bold moves here and again this
is Congress leveling up, this is the memo is Trump leveling up and saying we have your names on the
three FISA court events, Gary in the campaign, the nomination right through his election when
he's president-elect, those three warrants, when he's getting the nomination, when he's running
against Hillary and then when he's president-elect, three different warrants to spy on everything
in Trump land to spy and then and then they lie to the media and say they didn't and it's exactly as
William Binney, we got to get Binney back on ASAP emergency today if we have to, just just get him
on, please, Binney said I got a call, they like you to look at this memo, no one's given an attention
and then the media spun it, oh Jones made it up, it's not the congressional memo and what's Binney
know, oh I don't know, I don't know who picked up the phone and called him and said we'd like to see
this on the show, come on, maybe we'll tell you who asked him to talk about it because that is
the basis of the roadmap of their fraud and that's what they're now reporting is in the memo,
see, oh next week's news today, info wars was on target, info wars was correct and that Jedi

you're listening to the alex jones show
the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
we're about to go to the full remarks of the president just 15 minutes ago or so
on the bombshell congressional memo that details links and a roadmap to a larger
investigation that is now going to be launched into the confirmed political operation at the
justice department starting in the summer of 2016 before the RNC then when he was the nominee
and then when he was president elect for too much spying on his entire entourage the republican
party republican members of congress yours truly and a roadmap to demonize and call everyone
who is victorious in the american resistance against the globalist russian agents and the
document is up on info wars.com yes the document the original document that we broke last tuesday
that the media used the jedi mind trick and said oh well that's declassified that's not the secret
part it's the roadmap of this memo and it's now confirmed that it is the blacked out areas that
are being pointed out in this new memo that shows here's the key being reported by all the newspapers
now that it shows criminal activity lying to the faiza court not once not twice but three times
what did i say last week over and over again in every hour every day
again faiza memo confirms surveillance of trump campaign was based on dodgy steel dossier that's
poll's latest article but let's go back to last week's article where we published the full memo
that the director of national intelligence had published on their website that was hiding in
plain view that had excised portions but only about 10 wrote mapping three times that people went to
the court and the court said we believe what you're doing is illegal so they would come back
excluding the political nature of it and lying about their intelligence to get the warrants which
we now know were illegal and fraudulent and political read page 19 of the 99 page memo
this is what nunez based the proof of the perjury to congress about what the fbi democrat leadership
did the democrat moles in the fbi that's what it is and then it expands into them lying to
also get the three warrants exactly as we told you william benney is obviously being advised
by not just wiki leaks but the cia he's the former technical head of the nsa he came on last week
and for an hour laid everything out in front of you then we had congressman gates on to lay it out
saying the roadmap is coming out that's all the citizens of the roadmap the president's gonna
fight back we have the proof they've colluded well that's bombshell but this is just the beginning
and it's them lying to the court three times here pull up the washington examiner it's linked on
dredgerport.com and read what they say the main finding is that they lied to the fiza court and
the judges now recuse themselves that they lied to the court to get the memo and and what does
the what does the court say they say we were lied to this was illegal three times they just blacked
out who came to them and who did it well nunez can read the blacked out parts oh but let's not
listen to william benney former technical director of the nsa or anybody else of these congressmen
we have on let's listen to cnn and media matters saying i hoaxed everyone and this had nothing to
do with it when oh i'm sorry the cia you know just said hey uh you're going on ellipse's show today
you really need to cover this because this is the real memo but just don't listen to us ever
of course so you get next week's news today so here's the big news again they lied to get the
three warrants when he was about to be nominated it's all right here when it was about to be nominated
then it happened again once he was nominated and then it happened when he became president elect
three different warrants to track everything trying to find something trying to get russians in to see

over this and again uh this has been released by the white house they were telling us that congress

FISA memo the news comes after the FBI issued a rare public statement saying it had grave
concerns about its release which could be detrimental to national security FBI director
Christopher Ray is reportedly pressuring the White House to redact all names in the memo
prior to its release so much for transparency congressman Jeff Duncan says the release of the
FISA memo will shake the FBI to its core he revealed that the document exposes how the agency
was weaponized by Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration to spy on the Trump campaign
representative Adam Schiff has tried to block the release of the damning FISA memo saying he
discovered material changes to it chairman Nunez's office said the changes were minor and blasted
the complaint as a bizarre distraction from the abuses detailed in the memo and the soon to be
released FISA memo has been a trending topic for days because the deep state tried so hard
to suppress it leon macadoo info wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
you're receiving this transmission you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
it's alex jones we're not playing around with the resistance to globalism communism
pedophilia the globalists the narcissistic filth the communist chinese the nwo hollywood
the disgusting filthy nfl all of them go back to hell where it came from we're knocking them dead
we have the memo but i've had a chance to look over it uh during the break it's exactly what
our congressional sources said it was uh and you first got the white house two pages
describing why donald f mcgunn the second council the president decided that the president was
going to authorize its release and they state via the executive branch their executive power to
release it if they wish they're calling it treason that the president's released it claiming it's
illegal uh you've got new york state claiming that uh feds getting rid of the exemption above
ten thousand dollars for property taxes uh or income taxes state income taxes is illegal and
they're suing over that it's pure crap there's no precedent in law anywhere and they were arrogant
about the memo a few weeks ago now they have been in desperate chicken with their heads cut off mode
so without further ado ladies and gentlemen let's get into the memo here the constitution
vests the president with the authority to protect national security secrets from disclosure
as the supreme court has recognized it is the president's responsibility to classify and declassify
and control access information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods and national
defense and they list the us code in order to facilitate appropriate congressional oversight
the executive branch may entrust classified information the appropriate committees of congress
as it is done in connection with the committee's oversight activities the president's telling you
he quartered back this from january 20th first thing he did was go in there and find out okay who
did the unmasking the president the former president sir here's the order here's the fiza document
heads up his place he was given three hour briefings i'm told i know some of the folks that
were in the room and outside the room uh getting the further reports then he marched over to the
caa then the nsa he pulled it all up looked at it all saw how they tracked him followed him
listened to everything tried to put people on him tried to set him up with russians and then he sat
back while they lied and let them set themselves up perjuring themselves to congress when he knew
everything they were doing he even let mccabe and comey come in and perjure themselves to congress
lie to him face to face he played dumb the whole time and now we can tell you what we did to you
scum we set you up the whole time hope you enjoy yourselves part of the story that mueller was
secretly on the president's side the the the only truth to that was is that the president was shedding
them up the whole time fools your arrogance is what will destroy you excuse me let me just get back
into this i'm sorry just if you know how to read this stuff see what the letter says the president
released this the president did this the president gave it to congress the president met of course he
did it's his authority to give the intelligence on criminal groups inside our country trying to
overthrow our election and our republic and shut down the free press they keep asking has newness
met with the president has newness talked about this of course he has it's what the president's
supposed to do you are an outside threat you are enemy combatants let's continue ladies and gentlemen
the supreme court has recognized as the president's responsibility to classify and declassify
and control access to information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods and national
defense see they forgot who they are in the government they're there to serve the people
in order to facilitate appropriate congressional oversight the executive branch may interest
classified information for the appropriate committee of congress as it is done in connection
with the committee's oversight activities here the executive branch does so on the assumption
that the committee will responsibly protect such classified information consistent with
the laws of the united states the committee has now determined that the release of the memorandum
would be appropriate the executive branch across administrations both parties has worked to
accommodate congressional requested declassify specific materials in the public interest he
gave the investigation to the proper body the house they investigated they said yes this is
terrible and now boom however public released the classified information by unilateral actions
the legislative branch is extremely rare and raises significant separation of powers concerns
accordingly the committee's request to release the memorandum is interpreted as a request for
declassification pursuant to the president's authority so he did it again as the president
he initiated it he gave it to the investigative body the house that's an impeachment or any
other matter they begin the investigation and now the indictment has been handed back to the american
people powerful powerful gotta be ashamed of yourself as the president just said
the committee has now determined that the release the memorandum would be appropriate the executive
branch across administrations and it goes on under the president's authority the president
understands that the protection of a national security represents his highest obligations
accordingly he's directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the declassification
request consistent with the establishment standards governing the handling of classified
information including those under section three dot one d of executive order one three five two six
those standards permit declassification when the public interest is disclosure outweighs any need
to protect the information that's a repeat of the national security act basically as well the
white house review process has included input from the office of the director of national
intelligence uh-huh that's who originally released the actual heart of the matter the main internal
memo the white house review process also includes input from the office of the director of national
intelligence the department of justice consistent with the review of the standards the president
has determined declassification the memorandum is appropriate and the same program went on
to release this to the public the one we released last week based on this assessment and in light
of the significant public interest in the memorandum the president has authorized the
classification of the memorandum to be clear the memorandum reflects the judgments of his congressional
authors the president understands that oversight concerns matters related to the memorandum may
be continuing though the circumstances leading to the declassification through the process are
extraordinary the executive branch stands ready to work with congress to accommodate oversight
requests consistent with applicable standards in process including the need to protect intelligent
sources and methods let me let me boil that down for you we got a lot more we're going to give the
congress that that will dwarf this if the democrats and the globalists and the corrupt people at the
top of the fbi don't roll over if you don't roll over and if you keep having this war to try to
stop the recovery and all the rest of it we got everything on you jack just like our military
source jack was saying they got everything all of it and if you want to play hardball let's do it
soros and all of it just keep pushing you know one stood up to you you had a republican leadership
that you were in bed with before you're facing opposition that now has the presidency most of
the states and most the courts you will be defeated only a nuke attack taking out the president and
the republican leadership like they could have done at that west virginia event with the whole
situation i mean that they shouldn't all be in one place at one time i don't think that's smart
unless the democrats are there as well and they still might wipe out their own people on a sacrifice
i mean these are serious people are up against okay i mean george soros was happy to round up
thousands of fellow jews and sent them off death camps the den the left loves him for that they
think that's powerful they like that let's continue here
so that is released to the speaker of the house by the president and to the honorable adam schiff
ranking member of the house permanent select committee on intelligence so that is the letter
from the president's lawyer explaining that trump learned of this secret information as the president
the criminal activity he then gave it to the house intelligence committee and they have now
handed the indictment to the public and that's why you see headlines like the white house is
getting their intel from info wars because they're the one saying that trump was being spied on
that was all made up we were we knew because the democrats had bragged about it during the campaign
thinking the hillary would win so it's just amazing so here you go ladies and gentlemen when we come back

ladies and gentlemen i'm your host alex jones thank you so much for joining us i gotta tell you
reading the two page cover letter that the president's lawyer wrote tells you more than the memo
itself does it's exactly what congressman gates earlier this week told us it would be
it is it is exactly what we knew it would be it is a codified indictment of the compendium of what
we know with the democrats organizing this fraud to stop trump from becoming president
and then once he was elected to try to remove him from the presidency a classic conspiracy and we
have their text messages we have witnesses we have all of it but trump's being very judicious
as president he learned of it he then sent it to the house the intelligence they investigated
said yes this is really horrible and now the president says well if you need more information
we'll have to have it reviewed by the director of national intelligence and by the justice department
we'll send that on over to you show what it really is is a giant warning we caught you
we have you red-handed stop denying it we don't want to quote hurt the fbi we don't want to put
you all in prison you need to stop now your fraud you've been caught you're the ones up to your
eyeballs with the russians but just as i've told the president every time i've talked to him
they're never gonna stop and if they make deals sir they're gonna break them and they do because
they're so used to being in power you look at pelosi and schumer and i mean they look like
crazy villains out of a batman movie or something i mean batman villains don't look that nutty and
that ugly and that i mean look at schumer the way he was acting and and michael moreard i mean
these are really a bunch of losers who know they're losers so they crave running everything
because they're such sacks of garbage but enough of that the memo is everything we already knew
it just lines it up and lets congress tell the public what they found and then let the establishment
know this is a big warning to you get out of the way of america's recovery stop your lies stop your
fraud and they can't stop they're gonna come out they're gonna attack this they're gonna lie they
can't help it and then more is just gonna get released and miller's not gonna stop he's gonna
have a grand jury and died a sitting president never before been done isn't even constitutional
and they've got political articles and reuters articles every day saying well lawyers now say
trump could be removed by a by a by a jury well then there's no separation powers if the jury
is the house of representatives they're the grand jury the jury's the senate that's how it works or
any town in america could get their cousins together on a jury and say the president's i mean
travis county would have had trump indicted before he ever got an office i live in the democratic
county that's always indicted republicans around the state and trying to put them in prison they
always get overturned whether it's rick perry or uh tom delayed but that's what they do
they're not all corrupt but when it comes to politics travis county's famous for it so
that's what they're doing and and the word is now trump's being told they are planning to indict
you for perjury and then there's no no there's not even evidence of obstruction or perjury there
all the evidence is the democrats and the fbi agents lying to congress but lying to the phisa
court and that's the key that's why the director of national intelligence that trump puts at the end
of the letter released the declassified memo it was the president declassified the body
just took the names out of who did it and that's it it's the names of them going and lying to get
it i know i keep repeating that but you're not seeing anywhere in the media as usual what this is
it's a threat from the president to them that we have you by the shorthairs you better back off right
now and we've caught you in perjury in congress and to the phisa court and i keep repeating this
because it's bombshell that trump says in the letter that that's attached to the phisa memo
what the next game plan is he spells it out
where the lawyers at the dnc 1000 get exactly what he's saying so here it is january 18 2018
this is the secret memo that was finished in january two weeks ago roughly
and they lay out the purpose the investigative update a whole roadmap and then what they found
and i read it and it's exactly everything you've already heard here over and over again
and they've had people testify in the doj meetings not just the documents that or
struck all of them were desperate that donald trump not get elected and was passionate about
him not being president and they now have this from the deputy head of the fbi who's sung like a canary
and that's why the democrats are crapping themselves up one side and down the other
they are in conniption fits oh who's the fbi informant
the disgraced mccabe who just resigned a few days ago okay you may not go to prison but you're out
of the fbi get out of here you go you ought to be ashamed of yourself and trump is signaling
be ashamed of yourselves be ashamed of yourselves stop trying to organize killing me and all the
rest of it and i'm telling you they can't stop you think mule was gonna stop that nut thinks
he's the president he thinks we elected him wow this is just incredible
let me read into the most important parts of this and then i'll come back in and get into
more of it as well but this is simply amazing now here it is on page three
and it gets into it just as we covered last week when we already all right here it was already
in the actual memo they're sourcing just now we have the names before and after steel was terminated
as a source he maintained contact with the doj via the associate deputy attorney general bruce or
whose wife worked at fusion gps and was paid to create the dossier a senior doj official who
worked closely with deputy attorney general yates and later rozenstein who appointed special counsel
see rozenstein's their operative shortly after the election the fbi began interviewing or
documenting his communications with steel for example in september 2016 steel admitted to or
his feelings against then candidate trump when steel said was desperate that donald trump not
get elected and was passionate about him not being president this clear evidence that's a quote
of steel's bias was recorded by or at the time and subsequently in an official fbi files but not
reflected in any of the page phisa applications no and then it gets into what they did say to get
it which is a perjury to the court oh this is not political at all foreign intelligence we're looking
at foreigners during the same period or his wife was employed by fusion gps to assist in the cultivation
of opposition research of trump or later provided the fbi with all of his wife's opposition research
paid for by the dnc and clinton campaign via fusion gps the or's relationship with steel and fusion
gps was inexplicably concealed from the phisa yeah they did they gave fake reasons they did a parallel
construction we're going to go to break them up with roger stone i'll read over more of this this
is huge i don't even know if he's back yet uh from england speaking uh there at oxford to the

well a lot of the top people in the fbi that were part of the clinton crime network
stay behind network are now singing like canaries to the house intelligence committee into the
president and the word is from very good sources uh it's mr mccabe who's lucky he's not going to
get indicted the whole house of cards is imploding the man that they said front and center was the
top russian agent at the heart of this just spoke to the major unions there in the uk he spoke to
oxford now he's going to cambridge he joins us via telephone as he drives through the english
countryside so we'll see what happens and then we'll in this segment the next read some of the
real bombshell areas the memo that we haven't gotten to yet but it's exactly what roger stone said
back in january and february of last year from his sources it's exactly and it's the president we
now know from the cover page which is even bigger than i think than what we already knew in the memo
that says i'm the author but basically of allowing the intel of the house i'm ready to give more intel
to you that will destroy these people if they don't come to heal if they don't cry for quarter
the problem is they're not going to give us quarter are they roger
oh alex uh i've got to tell you in the 40 years i've been active in american politics and the
10 presidential campaigns i've been through i've never seen anything like this uh and it not only
is it extraordinary but but equally troubling is the fact that the president's appointees as both
fbi and cia directors joined the cover-up and sought to keep this information from the american
people they actually argue against the release of a memo that not only exonerates the president on
the question of russian occlusion but proves that the fbi actively was involved in fabricating
evidence to justify the surveillance of the republican candidate for president of the united
state it's it's 10 000 times worse than what nixon it's criminality it's 10 000 times worse than
nixon oh it watergate pales in comparison this is the the illegitimate use of the surveillance power
and authority of the state against a major party candidate for president and now they fought no so
so so they're they're fighting to obstruct now they perjure to congress they lied to the fiza
court to get the three warrants uh they have lied to the president i mean they have committed so
many crimes it's dizzying roger well we now know that they that they fabricated the underlying
evidence they never told the spice court the origins of the dirty dossier that it had come
not from the bureau not from our own internal investigations by our intelligence services
but from a political source the president needs to fire the current fbi director mr ray
who has fought the release of this document and as far as the last i heard was pairing a
rebuttal that he was going to put out shortly after the release but that's outrageous
that's it's absolutely outrageous he's more interested in covering up the illegal and
unkind listen there are a lot of good people in the fbi why can't trump find a patriot that's
known to be an american and now a deep state turd what is wrong with these people that they are so
arrogant well you notice when he resigned last week tray gowdy a great american said he was
returning to law enforcement notice he didn't say to the practice of law he said law enforcement let
us hope and in fact that was why i tried to get a hold of you yesterday what's the word is he's
gonna be joining at some type of task force trump setting up well he must be planning to go into
service for the administration he did pass up the opportunity earlier to be fbi director let's be
clear where mr ray came from he was heavily promoted by new jersey governor chris christy oh
you're saying he's announcing he's not gonna run for reelection because uh he may take that fbi director
job now that's what i believe but i'm keying this off the fact that he said he would be going back
to law enforcement he also knows that he couldn't wait till last minute to vacate the seat stay there
stay there you know i've got some talking points here about caveman from info wars life dot com
but instead of going on those talking points let me just give you what i've experienced personally
from all the wives tales in every culture we know that the bones have the essence we know
chicken noodle soup it's great for people that are sick again in every culture this has been
reported because it works and there's no way to quantify how strong this is but the amount of
bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this
is incredible ladies and gentlemen whether it's for your joints whether it's for your arteries and
your veins whether it's for your brain whether it's for energy this ladies and gentlemen is the
strongest most concentrated bone broth formula out there and it's amazing find out for yourself
today at infowarstore.com let it do for your family and again i want to thank you all for your support
you are funding the information war in 2018
Waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
press the attack keep it up that's what trump says the american people fighting back
that's his orders he's my commander-in-chief to me and i don't follow orders unless they're
constitutional and you bet i love following those orders so i'll quote darth vader and tell you this
stay in attack formation because they're not gonna give up yet roger stone is having a whirlwind
tour at first it was oxford and they wanted him at all the other big universities he's on his way
to cambridge can't wait to get all the hd footage back and and exclusively air that here but he's
all over the news there uh the guardian is police stating saying you shouldn't interview stone take
him off the air just like they did here take him off fox take him off cnn these authoritarians
want to just call you a russian agent call me a russian agent have congressional hearings about
censoring us the former president is suing you through this law firm he set up and admits he
runs with dnc money behind the scenes we can't announce it yet we got soros connected groups
suing me uh but we're breaking their back right now roger this devastating memo let's go through
the trifecta here and all the other key intel you've got and you're telling me it's on fire over
there in the uk i mean this is the biggest political soap opera it's so sexy it's so real it's got
such curves it's the marylem and roe of this and it's bringing america back it's not some demoralizing
scandal that hurts the country it is a cleansing it is a it is a good political bloodletting and
you read the president's intro sheet here's the trifecta i got more crap on you and if and we're
gonna come for you you got caught perjuring yourself to the fires of court you perjured yourself to
congress you perjured yourself to the american people we have you now we have your whole operation
i mean what on earth uh i'm just speechless roger stone right now and and how vindicated
do you feel well i'll tell you this i wouldn't feel too vindicated they killed trump and get
the system through they say they plan to arrest everybody thousands of us they plan to end the
free press we're facing real cancer and we've got a route it out or the country's dead go ahead roger
that's that's why i think the president's got to clean out his fbi director uh was more interested
in the cover-up of the legal activity by the agency than he was in exonerating the president and the
phony russian collusion uh investigation his cia director was lockstep oh no we can't release the
memo it'll expose our methods well the american people need to know what the methods are if the
methods are illegal the president needs to clean house and his opportunity to do so is now you
should fire fbi director ray he should fire cia director pal i'm going to tell you alex one amazing
thing about being in the u k is how many info warriors there are here you have a huge following
for what we are doing but the turnouts in oxford and in durham of young freedom-oriented students
in these supposedly liberal baskins has really been heartening uh you would get an amazing
reception here people really like what we are doing at the impetus beer i know that but we have you
as a great emissary my friend i could stay here in the command bunker but uh i i would like to go
out and meet a lot of the fans i get mobbed in the uk mobbed in europe even crazier in the us
and that's not bragging it's a gauge for people out there who feel like they're alone well you're
not a public figure well listeners and believe me there's some downsides to it so enjoy your anonymity
but when you get mobbed everywhere uh and people love you it's you know you're winning and then
of course every 10th person tries to pour coffee on you or assaults you uh so there's also that crazed
nature have have people tried to attack you like they do in new york roger uh there's no question
the libtards were out in full force last night screaming about racism and misogyny and all their
identity politics be asked because that's all they have they have nothing else uh and of course
everybody wants to ask me the most important question do you really know paul joseph wants it
yeah he's a rock star and doesn't know it and that's the thing is you're really a libertarian
republican you're fiscally conservative pro america but i mean you go to the gay rights parades
you've been for him legalization for 30 years uh i mean you're a pretty socially liberal guy
and when they come and try to stop your events calling you a nazi and all this stuff it's just
asinine bs well you know look i'm anti-war i think we ought to be out of afghanistan out of syria
but my real concern is about the erosion of our civil liberties uh and this scandal is all about
that look they gotta face a court warrant to spy on yours truly and they lied to do it they have
violated my civil rights at the same time they were spying on paul maniforte carter page and
donald jay trump and the media spends it goes right and the media spends it goes who cares about
carter page each warrant allows them to spy on millions in a giant dragnet and target everybody
including myself and they admit i've been in those phone calls and there's no no collusion
there's nothing they know that roger well why the guardian yesterday said that the bbc should
not interview roger stone you see they like censorship they can't win in the battlefield of
ideas they can't win an honest debate so they just want to silence us that's why yesterday i
punked the british media by going by the tiny cramped ecuadorian embassy where julien assange
who is not a russian asset who is a valiant honest journalist uh is you know they basically
being held a political prisoner amazing so what do you expect to happen now i mean do you agree
with me that it's the cover letter it's what's most important we already knew all the stuff in
here it just shows trump tells him i got a lot more i created the investigation the house found
that well you know that this was going on uh and i'm ready to come after you more i mean i don't see
how they recover from this well watch the fbi carefully uh because i think that that they will
launch a counterattack they're going to try to discredit the nunez memo also watch shifty adam
shift uh this guy has got to be desperate now because the fact that he's been working overtime
to cover up sedition to cover up this treasonous activity uh you know this man has no tape so he
will attempt to rewrite history i battled with the bbc all day today saying you're undermining
the authority of law enforcement you're you're helping glademire putin no i'm not i want the
law enforcement agencies in the united states to operate within the parameters of u.s constitution
everybody knows that third world nations and every other empire falls when the law enforcement
becomes corrupt and becomes political it's over you're going back to julia cesar 2050 something
years ago so it's the same story over and over again they know that everybody knows third world
countries they have corrupt police and scuffs that's why they can't get their act together
and and they're not bringing banana boat republic garbage here and they've been caught red-handed
but it's it's not just like they knew as stroke says in the in the text messages there's no proof
oh my god we're in trouble there's no russian collusion but we can't let him get into office
it's worse than that roger because then hillary is up her eyeballs in real russian collusion
well the other thing we know is that the president's de facto attorney general
rod rozenstein has known all of this the entire time he should also be discharged now interestingly
alex he very quietly through ranks previous then the white house chief of staff got the president
to sign a document that changed the line of authority at the justice department so all
decisions go first to the attorney general then the first deputy but then instead of going to
solicitor general they go to the second deputy a bush deep stater then they go to the u.s attorney
in texas another deep stater and then they go to the u.s attorney in north carolina how curious
this was their insurance policy so that Mueller and rozenstein could never be discharged that's right
they go oh my gosh he got in we've already been illegally spied we got to cover this up okay
hire a special counsel rozenstein already been quarterbacking this with mccabe with coming
oh mr president you know we have to do this they do it on their own authority they change
the power structure uh to then routed around internal affairs the the inspector general
they turn off internal affairs that right there's the headline rozenstein turned off justice department
internal affairs to carry out unethical uh operations i mean they but he's it's the president's
duty to fire them now even if it looks like he's doing it to stop him investigating him because
they're a bunch of crooks he's absolutely essential that he fired the fbi director in the
de facto attorney general mr rozenstein immediately they are up to their need in this

you're listening to the alex jones show
we're on the road he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side
you're listening to alex jones
roger stone has a city swine by he's driving along in the english countryside on his way
to cambridge he just spoke to a packed house in oxford where the info war has taken the island
kingdom by storm i think we've already passed our darkest hour at least in the current fights
with the globalists but there are great fights coming up as well the eternal vigilance is needed
roger you've been dropping some big bombshells on me uh while we were talking as you've been
talking to your sources and others so what does the president have to worry about now
where are we at the juncture with this memo uh and how how do the democrats grab victory from the
jaws of their defeat how do we how do we make sure that we don't smoke the same pipe of arrogance
that they've smoked let's let's look at the the danger factors right now in this epic
sea in which we swim well well remember alex we still have the uh the establishments hit man
robert miller the special council out there and uh he has sent two strong signals this week
i still believe as i predicted here sometime ago that the indictment of the president's son-in-law
on some completely phony clumped up non-russian related charge is imminent and i literally just
got a text message from a social press reporter who wants to know whether i think hope you're
sitting down whether hope picks the president's communications director was working for the russians
i kid you not which is the most absurd ridiculous thing i've oh oh oh while you've been in england
they're all over tv saying nunez is a russian agent i mean it's it's like saying he's a purple
dragon from pop tart land uh from candyland i mean it's entered and you know we laugh at this
i laughed at it and said stop being so upset a few years ago they were saying about you
then when they said about me and start cutting our websites off and banning us because i'm a russian
agent man it's like it makes you want to punch somebody in the nose well you got john mccain
out only only minutes ago saying the only person benefiting from the release of this memo is latimer
boogie this guy is literally demented at this point no senator the people who are benefiting from
this memo are the american people because the corruption of our intelligence agencies has been
laid bare for everybody to see so that the president can clean house fire rosenstein fire director ray
think about that they've been caught in their own text messages and admissions
making up russia yate to overturn an elected president they're the foreign globalist multinational
power we're exposing their foreign power that's what these democrats are they admit it they want
to get rid of the country it's borders everything we expose that they go oh no no america first you're
really russians and then try to block the recovery it's so ridiculous and now if we don't let them
uh impeach trump are indicting and removing we're russian agents just do whatever we say
or you're russian agents and rand paul you're a russian agent tucker carlson you're a russian
agent alex jones you're a russian agent devon unez chairman unez you're a russian agent and it's
like it's ridiculous until you have a foaming group of democrats come up they all look like they're
half dead and had lobotomies they all look like they've escaped from a lunatic asylum and it's
scary that they've got this many brain damaged people that actually think we're russian agents
roger well it's kind of like night of a living dead it really is quite extraordinary uh look
to see how micrarchism it's degenerated to name calling because they have to impune your integrity
and your patriotism because they have nothing else they have no positive program to run on
presidents running on prosperity and job creation turning this country around two million new jobs
in the year he's been elected president i want to say this i mean i mean if latimer putin was
behind this which again is completely absurd wow putin's making america great again i mean it's
it's absurd for them of course as we know latimer putin was for hillary clinton why else would he
pay john pedesta 38 million dollars through one of his oligarch banking buddies why else did he do
the was he paying them to get control of american uranium yeah i wonder away with the plinons i wonder
why trump is ordering heavy weapons shipped to ukraine and surrounding russia with troops
under putin's orders i guess yeah i mean that right there proves the entire nonsense that he
kills to the russians but he has no illusions uh but his real fundamental sin what the eyes of
the goblas is he would not expand the proxy war in syria that's what this is really about
illy promise to the war don't worry but let's be honest let's be honest letting sessions run around
trying to put pot smokers in prison uh is is horrible but that pales compared to being being
bullied into by the neocons that are in his in his office thanks to bannon into encircling russia
when russia is our friend now more and more and has been helping us defeat radical islam
and and when russia is full of resources and and and trump's instinct is to work with russia
and and and so that's really trump's only big failure well look i think he is i think he's
worried he has no illusions about the corruption of the soviet system out of the old soviet system
and he has no illusions about booting being a good guy but alex they have thermonuclear weapons
always better to talk to people who can destroy you than to try to go to war with them which is
the collision course we were on in syria a no-fly zone in syria pushed by john mccain backed by
hilly clinton was an engraved invitation for world war three sure in closing you said off air you
said they're really going to push trump well i mean repeat what you said just just in 60 seconds
that they're going to push uh trump to uh you know not damage and destabilize the country back off
so this story goes away so that miller can indict him that's it i think that they're going to try
to talk him out of cleaning house it's essential that he clean the house now rosenstein has got
to go as i wrote for him from words two weeks ago he should fire rosenstein then he should order
rep sessions to appoint special counsel in the matter of uranium one that is an investigation
of what entail miller combi mccabe and rosenstein himself who was the desk officer in that cover
up alex this is the greatest the largest treasonous financial crime in american history well it's now
being reported uh that fbi officials are saying that rosenstein will be fired after the privilege
of the collusion and if rey wants to quit and fall in his sword he needs to go ahead uh there it is
rosenstein will be fired after memo release using bogus trump dossier for fiza warrant
and again it gets into it right there we'll break that down after the break and we have a
former technical head of the nsa joining us uh coming up on the other side to give his take on
all this william benning thank you roger stone great job many thanks alex i'm just arriving at

you're listening to the alex jones show
go
ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide and it's posted
on info wars dot com right now
again ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide i am your host alex jones
and william benney joins us a former technical head of the national security agency uh and
he headed up the technical operations of that agency is the source of course uh and the main
technical advisor for the film snowden and a good american and so many other documentaries and
films and books that are detailing that and he pointed out when he was on with us last tuesday
that it had gotten no attention that a source had pointed out to him that there was a 99 page
memo uh report put out by the fiza court that they had been approached three times to do things
that they thought were unethical and they had sent the justice department fbi back before they
granted those we now know the blacked out areas just as mr benny said are the president being
targeted and so you have them that's what's in the new memo that the uh president are now released
of the congress today that they lied to get the memos they lied to get the uh the uh fiza court
thing three times the warrants then they lied to congress about what they did then they leaked
and lied about it uh and now you've got the entire fbi apparatus at the top along with rosenstein
the justice department and or and all of them an incredibly arrogant incestuous conspiracy that
their own tech show that they have committed so it's amazing and i was talking to mr benny during
the break and he was blown away that almost no media picked it up last week when we pointed out
that this fiza investigation is uses the blueprint to back up what the president has been saying and
what the memo itself says is put out by newness but enough of my breakdown of that william benning
joins us uh to go over this with us right now but again there's the amazing cover sheet by the
white house uh lawyer for the president saying we're ready to release more and to work with
congress to expose the full extent this is just the beginning so uh mr benny you had said last
tuesday you hope this was just the beginning uh and you've been told that this uh larger memo uh
investigation by the fiza court was one of the prime areas tying in and at a nexus point of a
third party the judicial branch uh now documenting what the executive and the legislative have found
yep yeah that's right uh and uh i think the more and more they go into it they're gonna find that
uh nsa is involved in this and that they need to look at what which names of people uh were
unmasked uh through the nsa and which ones were targeted through their collection system
and uh what what data uh they were using internally in the fbi and how they were using that data
that's really uh where criminality comes in where you use these agencies against the innocent or
against us citizens with no probable cause that's a direct violation of the fourth amendment
and they shouldn't have been doing that anyway they know that that's why they're trying to keep
everything so secret there's so many angles to this but just in general where do you want to start
as a true expert uh on looking at what historically is unfolding the debate it's causing i mean if we
thought snowden and drake and benny uh you know triggered so much of this in wikileaks honorable
people now what point in history have we reached i mean this is really exposing the deep state
yes it is and uh it's like uh the first place i'd start is to go after this sworn affidavit that
the fbi had to submit to the visa court to get that warrant that that of course uh according to the
memo seemed to focus on that dossier the steel dossier and uh and that that was a false basis
to begin with and they knew that and they they didn't even talk about the dnc paying to have that done
so this is paid propaganda used to get a warrant and the visa court to go after other people in
another campaign then and then that means you have to go into the and into the uh unmasking by the
white house of people who were in the trump campaign find out who they were targeting and what day
they were getting it how they were using it this is really a mess i mean it gets into the total
subversion and sedition basically and treason against this country and what's amazing is those
are true words that's not hyperbole as i look at the unclassified memo here in front of me william
benney and i think about the arrogance and the hubris of trying something like this and thinking
that you would have the justice department the fbi the democratic party uh hillary clinton all of them
admittedly fingerprints on it paying for it and then sending it to the justice department fbi when
they're the ones that originally paid to have it created and then going in before the court and
perjuring yourself and not saying this is political this was written by the dnc this was paid to be
made up as fake opposition research for those that don't know about the law even if prestigious
lawyers or companies or groups want to have something say in a supreme court case they's
called an ambicus brief they have to state who they are and then put their argument in because
all the facts of evidence have to have their providence and their chain and have to be accepted
in but to use the signant of the justice department and the president who we now that's
going to come out next by the way we know that front hasn't released it yet that the president
would order fake garbage put in and use that gravitas with the executive running into the
judicial like that this is an incredible constitutional crisis yeah and and it's by
the way uh this is not the first time that the fbi has gotten involved in uh lying to the supreme
court or falsifying evidence for the i mean not the supreme court but the visor court to get warrants
uh back in two nineteen uh in 2002 it was in august i think it came out of the news that the
visor court had had found out and discovered that the fbi had misrepresented facts in up to 75
warrants that they submitted into the court to get approval so i mean it's not new this is
something the visor court should already know and and know that those procedures are really a
hazard and a danger for them to be able to see through and stop i you know it's it's just a
total corruption of our justice system to allow this to continue well that's my point is that i
understand if trump doesn't want to look like he's guilty and then does it fire uh all these other
people like ray and and rosa's team but law says he has to he's the executive they've been caught he
he has to fire them all hell they ought to all get swat teamed right i mean you know you got swat
team for secretly testifying to congress totally legally about all this stuff that's right and uh
they falsified evidence in my case too and i caught them at it except like i couldn't afford
to go after them i'm not couldn't get anybody represent me pro bono or other people were with
me like herk webe and others we all wanted we all and ed lumas we all went to the rutherford
institute and i said yeah you know they did violate your constitutional rights but it's really
going to be a long fight and you know we couldn't afford to do that and we couldn't get a we couldn't
get a lawyer to represent us pro bono so we didn't pursue it so but they did the same thing here
and this is simply a continuation this is a very bad uh pattern of behavior by the fbi
and the doj together you know i watch mainstream tv and they're hysterically lying about everything
but we're here covering the facts and you're totally vindicated last week pointing out
that hey i'm told by sources this is part of the big investigation this is the memo
that they're going to source connecting where they lied and sure enough they mentioned the
fiasa court and the uh points that are in this memo uh at the times they went to get three different
warrants based on lies so you have been absolutely vindicated as the person
that pointed this out when it was hiding in plain view and and i know you're not about credit
it's just that george soros publications came out and said that you and i were basically liars
and this this had nothing to do with it but you've been totally completely vindicated well i would
also say alex that uh that uh it's really sad state that you're you and your program's the only
one being a talking about this uh fiasa court ruling and all that so i mean who who where's
what's the mainstream media their their job under the first amendment is to inform the the the
people of the country what their government is doing on their behalf and they're supposed to be
investigating and here they're abrogating that job they're not doing it at all so you know we
should take them out of the first amendment they don't belong there anymore they're no longer useful
in that area well and here you are the former technical head of the nsa super respected is
i mean like platinum standard everybody admits that even even liberals have to admit it and you're
saying hey this is really key this is a big part of it they just totally disregard and only a few
articles saying you know we're wrong it's the wrong memo no we know it's not newness is memo
but it's what he sources and is actually even more important when you get into the totality of it
the security agencies though have declassified it but lower level than mid-level they've asked
attention not be drawn on to this this is the court saying they came into us and we're trying to
break the law which actually makes you think wow these courts aren't as bad as i thought it compared
to these agencies we'll be back with william benning straight ahead stay with us
mike in arizona you're on the air worldwide go ahead oh alex you can rent any day of the week
thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save america

bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and
ourselves we can take our country back president trump is expected to swiftly declassify the
controversial fiza memo the news comes after the fbi issued a rare public statement saying it had
grave concerns about its release which could be detrimental to national security fbi director
christopher ray is reportedly pressuring the white house to redact all names in the memo prior to
its release so much for transparency congressman jeff duncan says the release of the fiza memo will
shake the fbi to its core he revealed that the document exposes how the agency was weaponized
by hillary clinton and the obama administration to spy on the trump campaign representative adam
schiff has tried to block the release of the damning fiza memo saying he discovered material
changes to it chairman nunez's office said the changes were minor and blasted the complaint
as a bizarre distraction from the abuses detailed in the memo and the soon to be released fiza memo
has been a trending topic for days because the deep state tried so hard to suppress it lian macadoo

or triple eight two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm alex jones your host we are sending out an sos
worldwide trying to drain the swamp incredible discussions during the breaks with dr william
benny former technical director of the national security agency and we were talking about
draining the swamp we're talking about the arrogance of these people we were talking
about where the fight goes on uh from here does this really harm us intel we're going to get into
it all right now with william benny with the release of the devastating congressional
faiza breakdown memo looking at how they lied to go to court uh and and get these search warrants
true perjury true crimes then lied to congress about it uh i don't think the president has
any choice he's got to move but mr benny if you just repeat your own words the powerful things
you were saying during the break uh about the arrogance but also uh the arrogance is only
matched by trump's courage i mean we have to say it in the last hundred years i've not even read
about or even another country something like this uh trump going up against this entrenched state
when he could have rolled over to them this is your own words about this place well and like
we were discussing i just see this as the as a crack a little small opening that's coming now
where we're going to be able to see into all the criminality and corruption and and simply
money laundering and bribery and all that stuff behind the the swamp and the and the secret
government that's involved here i mean what we're talking about is uh president trump having the
courage to stand up and start addressing the intelligence community and the power they've
been using like they are jade grover on supersteroids having knowledge and leverage on everyone
and using it and so i see this as uh as having seeing for the president is having the courage to
stand up and start cleaning the swamp and this is like core to that swamp once you start breaking
this up then the rest of it should fall fairly quickly and that's what he says in the cover
letter page and a half they say we've got a lot more we're ready to work with congress to bring
it out uh because this deals with our national security and this is our national security break
away rogue groups with a trillion dollar spy machine beyond the manhattan project playing god
trying to convert us to a high tech manhara republic yeah that's exactly right i mean
if you allow this thing to go on and don't correct the intelligence process and the
intelligence agencies you can do and can keep repeating things like weapons of mass destruction
we'll go kill a couple hundred thousand people or a gulf of tonkin affair that didn't happen
and we'll go kill a couple million people or you can you know you can destabilize the middle east
you can do all kinds of things that are simply wrong unfounded unsubstantiated and just uh
non-moral or anything else i mean this is just crazy we have to clean this up he's got to do that
he seems quite willing to do that and i'm going to be i would be there cheering him on and supporting
him any way i could well we know you've been advising him through ci director pompeo and
what you just said was so profound i got chills because gulf of tonkin killed a couple million
vietnamese on both sides killed you know 58 000 us hundreds of thousands horribly maimed millions
you know others uh you just totally psychologically shot that was all based on a lie and we have the
recordings of mac namara and the rest of it from the white house where they fixed the intelligence
and made that up and then you've got things that took us to war this office of special plans
inside the pentagon because they couldn't get the regular pentagon people to lie so they created
a special office now it's just a dossier in england made up ridiculous like a comic book
and then they're not just starting a war with some foreign country you know that's bad enough
it's against a sitting elected president i mean they it shows it's really a false flag it shows
how this whole false flag blames the russians but the targets the american people and the american
recovery and it just as you said it just escalates the hubris can you repeat what you said during
the break about their hubris well they are so arrogant that they've got they think they've
got so much power and control over everything that they feel they're just above the law and they
could do anything they want they can lie to congress out in the open and there are no
consequences they can lie to the president or anybody else and there are no consequences
because they feel they've got all this knowledge and power over everyone so they're just above
everything they're they are the know-it-all and we have to all follow them and we'll follow them
into these wars and things like that and the only people who suffer are our poor we pour people
down at the bottom of the pyramid you know they make the decisions and we suffer wow and
now it's starting to turn around a little bit and they're panicking and they're arrogant
and but it is a new super class imagine where they can spy on the republican nominees spy on the
the president-elect arrogantly the day before he was sworn in saying we got seven ways to sunday
to get you we're gonna remove you uh uh brennan said you ought to watch your mouth and then was
shocked when trump fired him three days later the day before the president sworn in you better
watch your mouth i mean that is that is like lunatic asylum arrogance but it's the arrogance of
these people that's that's the way they feel they are the ones who are at the real power that's their
position you know you don't brag about yourself i know you received a lot of secret awards basically
were the equivalent of multi-star officer you're heading up the nsa but your credit is being the
top code breaker ever in the nsa's history at helping bring down the soviet union so many other
things uh did did did you're amazing real power and ongoing when you left the nsa to expose all
this what in 2000 did that make you feel more humble the more power you got or or more powerful
because in my experience as i get more powerful i feel more humble and actually scared about it
because i know i'm fallible and have issues even though i want to be a good person but i
know people in my life that are like managers at restaurants who are these uh these primadonna
crazy people a little bit of power they go nuts yeah it kind of puts you in a position of realizing
these responsibility you have to whatever you say and make sure and make sure that what you do say
is true and and uh can be validated and verified or at least checked and and and you stand up for
it and yet you have to do the best you can to make sure you're only being honest with everybody
as best you can that's all and that that every the more influence you get the more responsibility
is to make sure that's true going back to 2000 when you're secretly testifying to congress with
others about all the illegal stuff that was starting up in 2001 could you though imagine
how this would happen and now wiki leaks and trump and i mean i don't see long term how this
corrupt superclass stays in place when what they're doing is show show discriminatory against
99.9 percent of us you know they they try to make blacks and whites fight all this other
men and women but the truth is we have a breakaway super state technocracy that thinks it's god
that's that's basically that's basically the problem yeah we have to we have to remind them
very very clearly and we have to look back we have to look back and go after these people
and hold them accountable because we don't what that means is other people coming into
those positions will be corrupted by that power too and say well look what they did i'll do that
too that's why i blame uh what's going on now a lot on jerry ford for pardoning nixon he was
being indicted for what he did on a much smaller scale it's the same that they're doing today but
it was a much smaller scale breaking into a psychiatrist office and having a list of 105
people that he wanted to be audited i mean we obama had it done to tens of thousands with
exactly it's of the scale is a microscopic yeah and nixon was impeached and then indicted for that
but there jerry ford pardoned him that took away the the accountability for the president
that said the president really has to get out of jail free card it's the next president
wow wow i want to just point out folks that we sell the film he's not even paid for doing it
but he's in it he should be he's done a great job mr benny has obviously a film like snowden
that he advised on that was amazing but also a good american dot or you can find the dvd there
we sell it in four store dot com pg uh knowledge dot e u is a plan to have these systems that are
ethical and don't give individuals power over others but actually targets real criminal threats
and real criminal operations once those tracking and nexus points have been proven and then that
comes out of the algorithm in the program you can talk about that a little bit more in the next
segment so find out about that and expose facts dot org we'll come back to mr benny and i agree with
him i don't feel worthy to even be at this platform level with somebody like him and so many others
breaking so much of this but it's it's it's that a little radio show out of texas grew into this
because other people won't do it if they say necessity is the mother of invention
and that's what it is they won't do their job so it's alex jones doing it and it's the listeners
then funding us to build organically the platform to get this out to millions of people because
they wouldn't do it they just took what they were told set it by the government corporations
as a bunch of yes men and women and got us in this position so i again i go back to the listeners
and the heroes like william benning he hasn't already called that but he is he went through a lie
and a lot of other stuff that i know is off the record he probably don't want to get into
he's he's a manly guy everything but they they really you know they pull the stops out i can tell
you and uh so this is a real war we need your financial support as well we just sell the very
best vitamins and minerals like our turmeric it's 400 plus milligrams the strongest 95 per cent
curcumin and we other stuff tested it holds just like three percent it's a joke because they just
think that they put everything in marketing market up seven times and you know a 30 dollar
bottle of something has like a dollar of product well not with us i mean if it's something 60
dollars it's got 30 dollars in it we market up 100 percent we got cell force right now with bio
pqq coq 10 other formulas similar 200 300 400 bucks it's a good deal normally at you know 100
bucks it's 69 95 right now infoworkstore.com it's about to sell out it'll be called dna force plus
the next time we run it though people like that name better but cell force is uh just dna force

Dr. Group you developed living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good
because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most i mean i
try to make sure that i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that
lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around we have
biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all the stuff
that says there's so many things that are in it you have the neem in there you have the organic
clove bud the organic wormwood i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right
well i'm glad we've got some back in because i'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday
living defense info wars life.com and folks you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your
body period and uh you support the broadcast info wars lives.com thank you Dr. Group from the
global healing center thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
you're listening to the alex jones show
all right william benney's with us for five more minutes and each interview we do just gets more
powerful i don't know what you call the last 30 minutes i mean the memos out i'll cover that more
in the next segment it's an exact blueprint and and sources the document that benney brought up
last week that no one had covered and you know the tree falls in the forest it doesn't make a sound
i mean if nobody's there didn't make a sound yeah that that had been out from the office of the
director of national intelligence no one was pointing it out benny did and the media just went oh
that's already been out but no one covered it you won't cover it it's now the source of much of
what's in the new nas memo don't you feel stupid so mr benning in the four and a half minutes we have
left uh i've been asking a lot of questions here but uh one point you wanted to make during the
break we were talking was this live this is hurting the us or hurting intelligence agencies are
giving out methods i i'm not an expert like you but i read the memo there there's nothing there but
a bunch of democrat operatives lying to get fake warrants yeah it's uh what they're doing is they're
trying to use national security issues as a way of covering up for their embarrassments to people
or the crimes that people are committing and i would also point out that there really wasn't
any need to to have the president declassify that under executive order 13526 section 1.7 which
governs all the classification of documents in the u.s government they are required to uh they
cannot they cannot classify and maintain classified or not declassify any documents that contain
information on about criminal activity or uh or embarrassment uh or corruption or fraud or waste
they cannot use that classification to cover that so in other words any any evidence that they have
a criminal activity must be declassified by their own actions and trump's following that he says
national security's been violated we have evidence of criminal activity it is my duty to give this to
the house they have found as i have found and i'm ready to get more information to the committee
that has got to make the globalists and these corrupt networks crap their pants and it would
because they've been so criminal i mean they have been doing this against it basically the entire
population of the united states and the world uh for since 2001 they've been doing this and and
they've been using it in court of law and perjuring themselves to convict people and
and thousands of people are in jail because of this program so you know they have a lot to account for
i would be ashamed spying on my wife or people if i had these systems i would be
you know there's just no honor and i guess they're trying to recruit people that don't have honor
and then the good guys i'm told it kept low level and then the bad people just get put at the top
until you get people like hayden and clapper and brennan you know uh before congress saying we've
never spied on one american it's just it's unbelievable well what they meant was we we've
never we've we haven't spied on any we have not spied on just one american we've spied on them all
that's what it is and and they they they they're so arrogant they don't care what they say they
can lie to anybody or say anything they want to and they don't think there's any consequence
this is why we have to look back this is why we have to address these issues with those people
and hold them accountable for what they did well i think we've come a long way we've had a long way
to go but uh they say the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step i think we've
gone about a hundred miles in a thousand miles and we're committed we're going down the road i think
we're gaining speed i think a lot of positive stuff's happening do you agree with that a and then
being closing how does the deep state strike back though because you were saying during the break
the fb is kind of the scapegoat here you're saying the nsa's behind it yeah i uh actually uh i think
we have a lot more that go than a than a thousand miles but i think we're in that this is the break
and i think this break now is opening up the real rottenness in our in our government in washington
and in the agencies that that make it up and so this is where this is where we really have to get
to it and it goes beyond like the fbis the front they take the flag from everybody because they
figure they'll still survive because we need the fbis but behind them are the supporting agencies
like nsa and and cia and others who are actually helping them do and achieve what they want to
do as a collective uh group of that i call them the uh pretorian guard who will determine what
our government does and so that's why that's why they think they have so much power now we have
to shine the light on and and show them out for what they've been doing and hold those people who
did it in those agencies accountable and make sure we we carry through all the law and apply all the
law equally to all of them so trump has to fire these people i think so all right william benning
thank you so much powerful information thank you so much sir we'll be right back climb to the top

broadcasting worldwide from the info wars dot com studios
welcome back ladies and gentlemen to this historic groundhog day february second 2018
i gotta tell you that last 30 something minutes of william benning was just unbelievable i mean
this is history happening we really are the good guys we really are turning the country around
we really are standing up against globalism and the poison of its anti-family transhumanist agenda
the telecoms the big internet companies have already told trump they're gonna stop censoring
but they haven't quit so he's gonna start breaking them up next
and then comey comes out he's gonna be teaching ethics what a joke when he leaked stuff to the
media a lot about the congress was involved in this conspiracy he's come out and made all these
sickening statements he says that's it dishonest's misleading memo wrecked the house intel committee
destroyed trust the intelligence community damaged relationship with fires the court
and inexcusably exposed classified information of an american citizen for what doj and fbi
must keep doing their jobs which means stay behind networks that matter we're all caught memos and
documents and emails and text messages admitting there's no russian collusion and we gotta have
an insurance policy and keep trump out and on and on and on comey arrogant maybe acromegaly or
whatever causes you to have brain problems they say it starts cutting into your brain stem i mean
maybe something's going on with him i feel sorry for his acromegaly but other than that he's still
a person and a bad guy at eight feet tall or whatever it is i guess they made him the director
to like scare people when you're like toddling and hardly walking it's kind of sad the guy's
bigger than andre the giant i mean i got he's a freak of political evil not because of his
acromegaly but because of his arrogance we now know from the fiza document you know it hurt me last
week when not the mainstream media but even some of the liberty-based media said oh jones just wanted
to get a cheap shot in and said that he'd released the secret fiza memo when we said here's the secret
fiza memo declassified there's 10 of it or so i haven't added it all up it's blacked out but
this is the illegal spying and they say they were asked to illegally spy and they block out who it was
against and by who but the word is this is new naz's memo new naz is going to use this as the
roadmap to prove that they did it politically and didn't admit it was political and didn't
admit it had been funded by the democratic party which is a big big deal it's perjury
and it hurt me that even though william benney came on and even though that was happening that
the media spun it that i said this was the new naz memo which is called the secret fiza memo
talking about the the crimes they had to give new naz's memo a name and the heart of it is the fiza
testimony and fiza putting a report out to the president april 20 60 17 he'd only been in a
couple months and they're like sir this is highly classified this is what they did to you
you he wanted a report he asked for a report the the fiza court gave him a report and said there's
three instances where they lied to us to get these warrants on you mr president
and then the names of who they were surveilling and then who asked for the surveillance is blacked out
but this is it
no coverage other than media matters and then a few of the other publications that
parrot their their bs towards soros bs saying jones tried to hoax his audience when i'm not going to
get into behind the scene stuff but benny was specifically contacted and hey we see you're on
jones's show no one's covered this this is part of the memo this is this is the this is the rosetta
stone this is what you want to look at that was a few hours where benny was on he said hey i haven't
read it all but yeah it's three instances of illegally doing it blah blah blah you had the
former head of the ns said that was all about that court telling you what was key but what does he know
he's just a valiant whistleblower screw him alex jones tries and fails to pass off publicly
available document as white house to a piece secret rush of ammo no i said here's all of it
that's not still classified and it's bombshell and no one had covered it except for rob do and
michael zimmerman a couple weeks before because it had been up there for a while and the white house
wondered why no one saw it because they ordered the director of national intelligence to release
almost all of it except who asked for it and who was being targeted and and zimmerman's like no it
is part of it alex we didn't cover it weeks ago and i'm like great i'm so proud of us that we're
the only outlet that we know of that covered it and i didn't even know we'd covered it because
i missed that war room episode i think where was i was shroyer then he was out of town so it was
it was zimmerman and dude at the show so it doesn't matter you know it's kind of like saying
how dare someone release this to wiki leagues instead of what's in the wiki league all the
crime i mean it's right here it's the whole thing three times they came to us and lied and we thought
it was illegal so we told him go back and get other orders and then obama told us to do it so we did it
and now we've got the actual house memo and most of the evidence in it directly talks about the
faiza court word for word and how they did it and how they went to the faiza court and lied to them
see here's the thing when i'm wrong about something i'll admit it but i'm not wrong
but like three four percent of the time and then it's when i get dates upside down or you know get
confused or say things wrong or call mccabe the director of the fbis of the deputy director i mean
i know he's the deputy director i know it's ray i just i don't have teleprompter so i
scramble stuff so i'll be listening to the show sometimes i'm going oh that's a mistake right
there five minutes later that's a mistake but it's not substantive like the boiling temperature of
water or uh you know the color of the sky at high noon it's it's just getting little factoids
backwards kind of like i have informational dyslexia but overall we're dead on because
we do the research and we're trying to tell the truth so when i make a mistake i'll run up and
down the hallway is telling you because i want you to know hey i didn't do that on purpose but
here it is enough about that we've got doug hagman of the hagman and hagman always amazing sources
coming up he has a lot of good fbi sources that are more mid-level and then he's got state police
that are at the highest levels and he doesn't mind us saying that because i know some of the same
sources i was in new york a couple years ago and had uh i'm not going to get it high level
individual at a parade walkover in uniform and i was like wow that's the that's the head of a major
body uh as our big listeners love the show doug hagman's a great guy you know we're buddies
going back to college and i'm just like okay that's kind of how you know doug hagman's really got
those sources when you know head of a police agency comes over to tell you about doug hagman
so doug hagman's coming up and he kind of get us the scuttlebutton new jersey in new york from the
fbi and the state police and so uh he's got those sources and he's got some judicial sources as well
but this is just such a crazy time to be alive right now and anything could happen minute to
minute i'm not watching netflix at night i'm not even going to movies hardly i'm not there's always
that little bit of entertainment in my life this is so entertaining because it's so real and so
dangerous and i'm in it and you're in it and we got a bunch of jerks trying to block the recovery
of the country and just basic america getting control of the country again donald trump's
not a conservative he's a pragmatist libertarian free market guy he's a throwback
people go oh we want to move forward america is the vanguard of free market and ideas even
though we were a mix of bad things we were the place that had that idea that was something we
were trying so we were known for that and so we're back to the future trump is the future because trump
grew up not wanting to screw people over i mean if you like to go gamble and be a fool and do
whatever he'll let you do that all day too he's certainly not an angel take it's just trump
doesn't like seeing poor people and unhappy people he likes seeing hard-working successful people
and that's what the globalist hate him because they want a bunch of demoralized losers they can

big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he lie from
the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones we are back live ladies and gentlemen and i was
thinking during the break what is the most important thing happening right now at this
explosively critical point in human history now i was really thinking about it and it's this
the corporate media the collaborator media that works with the multinational corporations that
pretty much conquered this nation are having their power removed their monopolistic control
they're still keeping all their stolen wealth and they're so arrogant and they're so angry
they're putting out the lie mccain comey shift that this is a nothing burger this is nothing
this is no big deal oh my gosh but it does damage our security and let the terrorists
attack us and this is the worst thing ever in the end of our democracy and trumps a dictator
blah blah blah even though federal law as william benney just stated shows that if crimes are
committed in the fiza court or in that process law says it must be declassified but let's stop right
there the average person will read the nuanced letter by the winehouse chief lawyer and chairman
devin newness's letter the trained i will read it and see something different than what the public
sees but it's all in plain view because at this level of fine art in its vernacular in its parlance
it is to be done very gently as you slip the knife in between the two vertebrae in the neck
it's done elegantly not brutishly and i read several times now and it's the letter from the president
on the front page that tells you everything it says i became aware when i was president
to classify information of your full operations after all it's you guys that put this giant
spigot in you want to know i have full access to everything and i contacted the house committee
as i'm supposed to by law and they got the information and they concur that there was
a criminal operation to overturn my election and fraud and lies getting the warrants and all the
rest of it which we have the fiza court coming to us in april of last year in a 99 page report
and telling us we've been informed by the court their prime informant both in lineage and in
importance the progenitor is the judiciary alerting the president two months after he was in office
january for every march april three months four months in a 99 page report of what happened
then the classified parts are sent to the house intelligence committee
shift works around the clock in federal court proceedings to block congressional moves and
others to get the fusion gps documents that were concocted by the justice department fbi
and the democratic party funded fusion gps and then all of the oh my god we need the insurance
policy oh we can't let him get oh now that he's getting in we got to take him out we got to remove
all that's already come out that's all in the text messages they don't deny it shift tonight at
three weeks ago okay it's all real but it's nothing it's nothing burger that's their spin now
as if you don't have common sense it's the end of the world total martial law from the dictator
but it's no big deal and this doesn't show anything so the big issue here is that they're going to say
this is nothing when the president says i don't want to release all this information
and i don't want to hurt these agencies but you're trying to hurt the country and hurt me and you've
lied and i'm not going to sit here while your main operative that hillary clinton ran mueller
plays this game okay i'm not just going to let you march my son everybody also off the prison
so a bunch of libtards can celebrate it until the country's recovery you people are out of control
stop if anything it's very judicious it's very measured it's very there's a signpost this way
destruction and trump's sitting there going uh i've been down the road you don't want to go
you're very close now smell the stink of dead political flesh but you look at that jackal
interns face of hillary or that nutball freak combie or any of those those those lunatic
narcissists fruit heads aren't going to stop
so now you've got russia probe lawyers oh trump might get indicted see before they said oh mr
president can never happen now his lawyers are oh it is coming mr president because they were
always planning this getting up close to 2018 so here's the big issue this is a giant memo
the cover sheet alone is bigger than the memo who's already knew all this that's in the memo
it just says hey the president initiated this we've got more that's the big news we got a lot more
we're ready to release that's a a is the president initiated this under the law
and we've got more information and then b
you guys committed a whole bunch of perjury and a whole bunch of crimes
in this thing and we're ready to fight you
and that's it we've got the intel you know we've got the intel we got a lot more we're ready to
release you committed a bunch of crimes we're ready to go after even more just get out of
the way and let the country recover and we're not going to euthanize the veterans and hillary
and the democrats at msnbc and cnn are going hell no so more comes up you don't run up the wine
flag more comes up and soros is already having his assets all over the world tied to human
smuggling i mean he's been caught shipping in hundreds of thousands out of north africa alone
on those on those uh zodiac rubber boats that's in the news the italian navy just stopped them
two weeks ago that the italians got a call from somebody called nato called trump
because the united states is nato
so you first trump threatened to cut nato's funding off to get him under control now we're in control
again of nato not soros in the e u and now we're telling soros we're taking you down you know
there's the headline george soros linked to funding human trafficking and terrorism and
guess what oh some stuff's happening to soros right now you want to move against soros oh what's
going on so there is the compendium of trump i know i'm the president i've got you dead to rights
i contacted the house they concur i'm ready to give them more information i'm ready to move
and i'm coming on against you and you've committed incredible crimes their response is shift says i
look like a psychotic serial killer with little weird bug eyes and i'm on a power trip and i'm
gonna get you i'm not gonna stop we're like okay then get ready rack them up huckleberry
it's all what you asked for you're in charge of where you're going
because trump knows metaphysically he's gotta be the good guy he's gotta be taking the high road
he's gotta be the one that's defending so he just keeps giving him chance after chance after chance

you're listening to the alex jones show
the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind all right dug hagman the
hagman report one of our great law enforcement sources on the east coast with the fbi the
state police you name it oh my god it's broken so much the big news here it's going to be hosting
the fourth hour along with a lot of new clips as the president speaks how things develop
and we're going to him here in just a few minutes though and i do intend this sunday when i'm back
four to six p.m we're going to take phone calls your response to memo all of it but for me again
the big takeaway uh with this whole situation is that the president's saying i'm ready to release
more we're standing up we're fighting you this is criminal we're exposing what you did we're
calling you out we're not just going to sit here and lay down and take it and you purge
it yourselves three times to get these warrants and then you targeted people politically so that's
coming up i also want to play a clip of the president's response earlier uh talking about
how they should be ashamed of themselves and the media spend that says the whole fbi or the whole
government they're the one saying that it's clinton criminal groups like a hijacker of a plane
the average rank and file folks at the fbi uh are are really awake and i only discovered that in
the last decade when i ran into folks and got documents from the fbi and federal marshals
and others i've just found the fbi at the grassroots level to be very very helpful in
anti-new world order that's what william benny's a big patriot former head of the nsa he said listen
i found the fbi is the scapegoat for all the deep state agencies that use it to hide behind
and then they run around like erin boys now i'm not sitting here defending the fbi and the actions
of its history and what it's done but do you ever hear about the 17 agencies other than maybe the
cia or no you don't yeah yeah it's all fbi when something secret comes out on my show this order
by the army to go grab some witness you know and call them into the army i mean the fbi are like
erin boys so they become kind of the scapegoat even with the democrats that are inside when they get
caught committing crimes they then go oh don't attack the fbi we're the fbi no you're not talking
scarface from the which is based on a cosmology of true stories uh it's the guy that wrote that was
of course uh you know the same guy that made snowed and all the rest of it uh but oliver stone
he said tony mentana's sitting there with the corrupt cop that's trying to get him assassinated
and he says get ready i'm gonna kill you and he goes you can't kill me i'm a cop
and he goes whoever said you was one and that's what we're coming down to here comies on an fbi
agent mueller's on an fbi agent mccabe's on fbi agent their deep state clinton operatives
good god hillary gave his wife 500 000 cash she kept a couple years ago i mean think of what we

great patriots and their safety in numbers so i salute everybody now we're gonna get his breaking
intel on this memo what it really means in about two minutes but first i wanted to play the president
earlier today right we started the broadcast he made this statement when he was about to meet with
north korean uh defectors who left that dictatorship and and how horrified they were and how scared
even be you know still of kim jong-un uh but but first he made this statement about the release
of this congressional memo detailing the roadmap of criminality here it is i think i think it's
terrible you want to know the truth i think it's a disgrace what's going on in this country i think
it's a disgrace the memo was sent to congress it was declassified congress will do whatever
they're going to do but i think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country and when you
look at that and you see that and so many other things what's going on a lot of people should
be ashamed of themselves and much worse than that so i sent it over to congress they will do what
they're going to do whatever they do is fine it was declassified and let's see what happens but a
lot of people should be ashamed thank you very much thank you very much stop there again i cannot
quantify how historical this is trump is teaching us how to fight again he is taking out the hijack
networks inside the government that have taken over these agencies and groups he is removing the poison
in my view i want to get doug hagman's brief take before he takes over in a moment on am i right in
my assessment and i know he always has amazing intel so again ladies and gentlemen doug hagman
of haggam report dot com tell us what you know i'll tell you what i've been glued to your broadcast
the entire day a historic day you are absolutely correct this is this is the biggest scandal the
biggest crime that that we have we have seen at least in my lifetime i mean this doors watergate
the um the superlatives this cannot be understated the importance thereof cannot be understated
the bottom line here is this the exposure of the uh the coup the attempted coup by the weaponized
department of justice by the weaponized fbi known by uh certain rank and file members of the fbi
who are actually white hats exposing this as well bottom line uh they went after donald trump
they're going after the american people this is an ongoing um issue and also the bottom
line is this this people think that this memo the the three page three three and a quarter page memo
is in fact the the end this is just the beginning and it's going to get much worse the exposure of
the deep state operatives the shadow government the people the swamp creatures this is going to get
much worse and there will be i'll tell you what people will go in this is what i'm hearing there
will be charges laid against certain individuals within the department of justice current and
former because of this information and information that supports this document um and the names of
course within the document as well as those implied whether it be bruce or or peter struck they are
they're worried and they should be and the last thing and i i just really want to drive this
point home alex this is a scandal crime more appropriate that goes directly to the office
or to the white house to the obama white house obama knew totally he knew about this in fact he
facilitated exactly what we read in this three and a half page memo he facilitated this he was a part
of it the presidential daily briefings contained information and if people knew this is what i'm
getting if people knew the contents of the presidential daily briefings they would be
absolutely astounded at the level of complicity by barak hussein obama very you just shut it and
that's what i was told by congress folks just they've got those now the president has them we'll
talk about that i want to plow into all of this but i'm going to spend a few minutes here first

you're listening to the alex jones show
we're all living in america america
we're back live i'm alex jones your host doug hagman an amazing source
his own broadcaster long a career in law enforcement a lot of activities on the east coast
joins us hagman report.com this excellent website amazing information that he's broken so many times
here but if you just joined us ladies and gentlemen we've gotten pieces of this foreshadowed
by the house intelligence committee by senators as well that have seen the larger body of the
intelligence this was a very light shot across the bow the fact that they're willing to fight back
and the fact that they said they have more that's the big shot across the bow that they're
they're they're waiting to use but it's very very limited but what hagman just said
we saw members of congress some of which have joined us saying oh this will embarrass obama
this this will embarrass uh the president and take the shine off him and that's exactly what
we've already seen in the campaign at the nomination when he was then running against
hillary as the nominee and then when he was president-elect right before the nomination they
start surveillance when he's running against hillary they open up another warrant to spawn
even more people with one warrant they can spot on millions in dragnets that's admitted they keep
going oh big deal we spot on this car you know this person down here or whatever it's a larger
dragnet and then once he's president-elect they had a couple months november 8th until january 20th
and they went really crazy then but couldn't find anything so now they had to cover it all up
so for me the big issue here and the thing that's hiding in plain view is that
obama with the justice department working with the democratic party we now know
was han showing this and i have been told by sources that that's the ace card that trump
holds one of many cards but it's the ace of spades is that the president of the united states
iraq is saying obama 44 called a royal flush if you want was getting daily briefings
during the last weeks of the campaign and right through on directed white house programs as we
know is the people under him had to unmask the trump folks that were following they were in the
white house surveilling trump and his family and myself and roger stone that's admitted
but that the president was getting briefings purely political off that investigation off what
trump was doing what he was saying what he was planning it's not enough that they see an end we
now know in wiki leagues was giving the debate questions to donald brazil weeks before so hillary
had a more all three moderators ganged up on all the shows including fox all the rigging like
gladiator he's fighting you know the five tigers and the and you know the you have the champion from
gall i mean it's that rig and still he won still we won still because we woke up we overpowered them
and that's what hagman was just getting to he's taken over in the next hour but dug that is bombshell
because that's what we know they were doing in the white house but that's what i'm hearing
is coming out next is they've got his executive privilege won't work president the president
if it's illegal the word is trump has witnesses and people ready to go forward that they were
using the white house as a command base with the nsa trying to stop prompt from getting an office
this is a 50 000 times worse than richard millhouse nixon is that what you're saying from your sources
100 percent precisely and and one can go back to november 17 of 2016 when admiral mike rogers
head of the nsa broke ranks made an unscheduled visit to trump tower you've covered this met with
don met with donald trump and in that meeting we don't know of course what he said but certainly
the effects of what he said were clear because of the next day donald trump moved from trump tower
again as president elect to the golf course and bed minister of new jersey because of what
mike rogers said and basically what rogers said and i'm speculating here is the fact that hey
but again he didn't give the heads up he went there to report the treason that that's right
and then right after that of course you saw clapper and others calling for rogers rogers
to be fired because of the breaking ranks but this all the roads lead right back to obama
and and as well as the parallel roads lead back to clinton because with with hillary clinton as well
i just have to mention this hillary clinton using a private server set up
uh barak who's saying obama in the white house communicated from russian soil on a private
server to hillary clinton while she was in russia thereby enjoining him in this conspiracy where he
was powerless essentially to sign off on any prosecution of hillary clinton in the server
issue the private email issue the reason i bring this up is because all of these are components
of a larger more widespread series of criminal activity that we are now seeing that that this
three and a half page memo or three and a quarter page memo is alluding to in some respects these
surveillance and by the way it was the entire thing this was a setup this was a sting operation
against donald trump and people need to understand that this was this was a surveillance operation
against a person without a preg it without their own record sending in democratic party operatives
like this natalia lady from soros saying it's about uh adoption stuff and and and and then
changing the subject when it's admitted that it's their operative and that blew up in their face
because trump is so straight lace yeah and you've got glenn simpson from fusion gps testifying
before the house and senate denying that that he knows for example natalia is on the sky yet he
met with her the day before and the day after that that donald trump meeting um where where the
information was supposed to be disclosed to donald trump jr what this is insane but this lays bare
in my view the the absolute i can't even find the the right words for this except to say
this is a sting operation against donald trump this is an attempted coup an attempted political
assassination by the highest levels in the fbi and the doj and look i i'm all for a law and order
i'm all for the doj i was an operational asset for the fbi in the 90s but i gotta tell you something
never never would any fbi agent i know would ever put up with this or anyone from the department
of justice this was a sting operation designed to uh politically assassinate donald trump
and it it almost worked it and i was about to say the recklessness of it is is frightening i mean
this isn't like lying on intelligence to launch some new war that's bad enough you're trying to
overthrow an election of people that really want to return the country claiming they're russian agents
when you're up to your eyeballs with chinese and russian collusion yourself the here's the thing
this isn't business as usual trump as i as he knows cannot allow them to continue on i get
to be fires a bunch of them uh right now they go oh look you're doing that because you're desperate
no it's his duty now as the executive to fire rozenstein who we know is now running all this i mean
it's it's insane i mean it's really insane oh insane to the max but i think now you're gonna see
uh over the next 24 48 72 hours i think you're gonna see people um obviously luring up
seeking legal counsel you're gonna see some resignations probably next week you're gonna
see some people escorted from their their offices just like it's like a cave this week
yeah yes yes but this will be even uh uh more uh more broad because from this three and a
quarter page memo they know meaning the deep state they know they've got a lot more the
foundational documentation for this memo and you went over that uh which was a brilliant uh that 99
page uh fiza audit that she went over with with mr benny last week just take a look at that
and and that's got that's got the three cases that were masked that's blacked out that when
they said this is illegal fiza was telling the president sir in april this is illegal
and gave him the report and i know that white house wanted that on the air and and i'm the media
just covered it up yep of course the media is complicit in this and when you look at the
at the level of complicity by the media and and by the way the the fusion gps documents and i know
that this is kind of being shocking around here a little bit but when you when you look at what's
being requested from fusion gps and what it was turned over we saw the credit side of the bank
records from fusion gps but what we didn't say yet is the debit side who they paid in the media
to uh to propagate the russian collusion story when that hits and when that when that gets out in
the open there are a lot of people who are going to say oh man well that's the word congress has
leaked that reportedly two million through the fbi adjust department went to family members that were
at gps or his wife they tried to deny it but word is they've they've committed perjury the word is
that that they have the documents is that what you've been told absolutely they've got the documents
in fact the officer the officer the inspector general michael horowitz has
additional documents you go back to the texts that were lost never lost they've had them that was
something totally let me ask you about that when we come back i'll host a little bit with you the
next hour and let you take over man you're on fire i mean doug hagman that microphone sounds even
better than mine a little bit jealous that studio is doug hagman it's good to see confident badasses

it's just total bish because i know i researched what's going on and then i look at my guests like
hagman or what i'm doing or our sources i mean i think about the sources i've got sometimes and i
just i don't even deserve this it's kind of like william betty said he goes this is a shame alex
you're one of the only shows will put this out you know this should be on bigger and it's like
i don't think that's an insult it's it's true that guy should be on nightline you know that guy should
be on meet the press but but you know it's it's incredible the fact that we're in the middle of
a second american revolution the economy's coming back if you were artificially suppressed you've
got a crazy deep state on the chinese communist payroll man they're like puppets and we are we
are just in the middle of this and then i see a third of the population smoking the new world
order dope that literally think we're nazis and when when soros is a nazi and and and running
almost all of this he's like the evil engine behind it the will it just it makes my mind
boggle doug hagman it's just i don't know how to quantify historically where we are right now
you know i was thinking about that this morning and as the memo actually came out
look i believe right now today we sit in the most perilous time in american history one of the most
significant times in american history and i don't see that lightly because i know all of the
um um how this could be blown out of proportion but when you see the fact that during the revolution
we did uh the reasons for the first american revolution and we see what's happening today
look we don't have an mi5 as sabash and gorka had said we don't have this secret police internal
with within our government yet this is exactly what we're seeing having been formed you just
quantified that's it the clinton's had set up a secret police pictorian guard within key federal
agencies openly involved in espionage not against trump but against the will of the voters in our
republic itself this is treason absolutely treason sedition and uh look you know i i was joking
earlier today i i would maybe should buy some uh stock and rope companies and i and i don't say
that lightly nor do i um i don't want to sound glib about it but but i've i've got to tell you
when you look at all of these scandals all of these crimes combined um and when the shoe fits
where is it i i mean look exactly if trump doesn't go after the magress i don't want vengeance i don't
want to corner people but we're already they're already cornered they won't give up we have to
dash them out now yeah if not if not now when we're not going to have another opportunity this is
it and that's why god is giving us our one shot i'm sorry i'm interrupting you we're saying is
total veritas this exactly and look when i say stuff it makes me public enemy number one when i
say we got to get them and they but i just can't lie we have to crush them right well there's no
other alternative except crush them or be crushed expose them or forever lose that opportunity
at this point and this is what i believe um these overlapping crimes i'd look look the the crimes of
hillary clinton will come out the crimes of lois learner under the well i could select any number
of names and individuals under the obama regime they're all going to come to the forefront and
it's because of um for example the uh house permanent select committee on intelligence
devon newness pushing this to the forefront it's because of michael horowitz the office of the
inspector i was about to say if it wasn't for these men and women's courage we would not we
finally had real people in congress so it wasn't just trump or the media or the people the planets
aligned didn't they about exactly the confluence of events and the fact is in everyone listening to
this uh we are being presented all of us individually and collectively with an opportunity to take
our country back and we need to do that right now because if we don't do it now it's we're not going
to be let's come back and talk about that then i'm going to get out of here because i want you
to host the show but you're just on fire because we're all on fire this is a spiritual choice isn't
it god knows about our covenant america was based in christianity and this is our last chance we're
all thinking oh this is great if we make the wrong decision on the stub you agree that that
we're going to be totally turned over to evil exactly god i've never had chills this strong
i'm not kidding i'm on fire right now i i think i'm burning right now because the energy is so
strong right now because as goes america show goes the world this is the future destiny
president trump is expected to swiftly declassify the controversial fiza memo the news comes
after the fbi issued a rare public statement saying it had grave concerns about its release
which could be detrimental to national security fbi director christopher rey is reportedly
pressuring the white house to redact all names in the memo prior to its release so much for
transparency congressman jeff duncan says the release of the fiza memo will shake the fbi
to its core he revealed that the document exposes how the agency was weaponized by hillary clinton
and the obama administration to spy on the trump campaign representative adam schiff has tried to
block the release of the damning fiza memo saying he discovered material changes to it chairman
new yens's office said the changes were minor and blasted the complaint as a bizarre distraction
from the abuses detailed in the memo and the soon to be released fiza memo has been a trending
topic for days because the deep state tried so hard to suppress it leon macadoo info wars dot com
coming to you from the former united states of america from deep in the heart of texas it's alex
jones
doug hagman is on fire i'm on fire we're all on fire because this signifies elements of congress
the presidency the courts fiza came to the president in april and said sir they brought us
three illegal warrants on you and we said no but they brought them back and it was ordered by the
president and now you have the fiza court you have congress you have the president that's all three
branches trump is doing everything by the book that's what's amazing in iran paul said i could
never be a dictator it'll be hard to fix things trump isn't doing it as a dictator he's doing it the
way you're supposed to by sheer force of will making hundreds of phone calls a day going and
meeting with people uh that's why they hate him i mean it's it's messianic the energy the way
trump hid all this except his dad was giving the john birch society money he was writing op eds against
napkin gad i talked folks that were hanging out with trump 20 30 40 years ago he bitching complain
about can't somebody really run and turn this around make america even more wealthier more wealth
makes more wealth plunging us down doesn't raise the world up i mean trump just gets fundamental
economics and he likes prosperity he's a service oriented billionaire uh the blue collar service
billionaire and so i mean he'll break your neck if you take a swing at him but he's not out to just
oh look at that family they're good looking they got a nice family and they got a nice house i want
to make them poor so i run them trump's like the ghost of christmas present ladies and gentlemen
he wants prosperity and that doesn't fit into the austerity world government view of the globalist
that want to make you poor so doug just recapping the epic moment we've reached um the train derailment
the attacks the trump and the republicans meeting in that bunker yesterday before i mean they know
this is all coming to a head they know they're the globalists are getting ready to make their move
mueller is so narcissistic and insane the word is he's going to go ahead and get that swamp jury
in dc to indict i mean out of the swamp uh i mean i've talked to people that have been there it's
been in the news they say it's like a anti for black lives matter uh glorious steinham event uh and
so what happens there the attempt to impeach i guess 2018 is everything while trump tries to
right the ship get the deep state out of total control turn the economy back on we've got to watch
his six in these upcoming elections where we saw with roi moore whether you love him or hate him
15 points behind in polls loses by half a point democrats showing up in airplanes and buses saying
we got names of dead people we're going to go vote i mean they stole that election we now know
katie bar the door they are total blue wave attack and if we go to sleep and are self confident
even though we're having initial victories because of trump's uh gravity well we are gonna i think
lose the big one if we let him get surrounded what do you think yes uh exactly i i think we need to
uh well make sure our we are buckled in and our seatbacks and trade tables are in their full
upright and locked position because there will be blowback you can expect blowback from the
deep state from the shadow government this will not go without response uh and we've seen it we've
seen the pathetic attempts by adam schiff and others about this uh in response to this memo
but see again this is just the first shot across the bow what comes next is the foundational documents
for this what comes next is the implications or or the um uh yeah the the groundwork to to uh not
just dismantle the legacy of barracusan obama as as donald trump is doing which is just infuriates the
deep state but uh it holds to account those individuals who have really attempted to subjugate
all of america to uh and overturn an election and overturn the will of will of the people look these
people are are out for blood their their death grip on their um attempts to maintain power it's just
absolutely this is a no quarter given none none received none given back this is a death battle
yes yeah and i think people need to realize the the serious the the serious nature of what we're
seeing here uh the people within the deep state just as we saw hillary clinton not going away
quietly barraque obama not going away quietly establishing a beachhead on embassy road there
uh with a complete with a skiff look there's a reason for that there's a reason why these people
aren't going away quietly and that also goes back to the uh december 21st because they've
committed such massive crimes their own underlings they're having to pay off they know will come after
them they've got a lot of guaranteed payments made and as their saudi money gets cut off as their
chinese money gets cut off as their vatican money gets cut off as their eeyu money gets cut off as
their hollywood money gets cut off all the people they were paying off are going to come out against
them so that's why we can't just they're not going to give us quarter even though we're kicking
their butt i mean i'm not and here's the deal folks i get it battle they've already come in
and i'm not going to complain about the stuff they've done a lot of it's public some of it's not
but i mean up to a hundred journalists so-called journalists in the room trying to make me lose
my kids you know the message comes down from my oh hi rollover this will all stop i mean you know
and i'm kind of proud of myself most men say yeah you know i'll i'll rollover if uh if you you know
leave me alone hell no but the point is people you know how serious this is a lot of us have made
big sacrifices to bring us to this point me one of the least but i'll tell you the hell the trumps
have gone through just the experience i've had has has been unbelievable it's made me much stronger
and have a much bigger soul but and so i've actually very pleased i'm very honored i i appreciate
the persecution i don't say that to mess with my enemies i have it's these these trials have really
helped me uh blossom but but people understand this is a real war and you know yeah people need
to understand that this is this is far beyond the political candidates this goes into the
journalistic venue people are under surveillance you're under surveillance we're under surveillance
and and um look this whole thing what's going what's taking place right now is to attempt to
shut us up to shut us down to to shut you up and shut you down same with us uh people like
sean hannity and and and sarah carter isn't sean hannity a champion he's just fantastic
yeah yeah and and he look look uh for whatever people want to say about sean hannity at least
he's the one that's out front covering well he used to toady around with bush back when things
weren't totally clear but now that it's clear there's no going back for hannity and it's a big victory
absolutely and he knows that and i know people in direct contact with sean hannity on a daily
basis yeah tell folks i want to the media makes a big deal about it but he i mean you know it's
true i mean and then they spun it said he thanked me no he thanked us through david night and others
and through some other people and and it doesn't matter the point is is that he understands it now
he understands he was he was a kind of a good old boy who believed the system wasn't as dirty as
we said because he wasn't a bad guy he is kind of a you know boy scout uh eagle scout type guy but
now that the eagle scout type guys finally get its real they're in the fight now absolutely and
there are so many people want to take him down take us down take all of us down this is a street
fight right now not now it's turning from uh the ethereal if you will now now it's real it's it's
in the it's in the streets um i don't mean that to say the you know the antifa stuff but i'm talking
about this is a street battle bare knuckle battle then and we are in the thick of it let me ask this
question real quick the average fbi person is hardworking and decent good we have the corrupt
politicals at the top what percentage would you say the fbi right now from all your contacts
are supporting trump supportive of donald trump the vast majority i would say well over 75 80
percent in the in support of donald trump in terms of the uh the uh ideology how many how many
reality winners though have penetrated the fbi too many especially at the mid to top level
management when i say top level i'm talking about the the top 10 percent um when you get above the
certain obviously certain pay gradient position remember the word about the former head uh i mean
i just read these people do it's it's they're in a power cult they're the most chicken you know what
people i just can't believe it yeah it's look look um the the way i see it too here is the um
the people who fought against the release of what we just saw today uh they're obvious they're the
obvious actors perpetrators of the uh sting operation against donald trump and it goes
far worse than that the other people the rank and file obviously the people that i deal with
that that like us that that uh want us to just want to see america survive hard workers they're
pushing back um now i've got to tell you that uh what i was on your show earlier the secret society

oh
destiny providence
look i know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen but it does happen
now it's doug hagman on the
sea
from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones and also the fourth hour from the east
coast is doug hagman thank you alex thanks for allowing me to host info wars info wars dot
com what a pleasure this is if i screw it up look i i'm new at this all right um i've got to say
this i'm a big fan of info wars and i really appreciate everything that alex and his crew
does info wars dot com of course now so much to get into i was i was glued i don't know about you
but i was glued to info wars all day to throughout the program today the information that is coming
out the the obviously the white house uh uh or the um uh the the unclassified memo that came out
today making big news and of course the white house statement that came out with it big news
but the the real biggest news i think and i i think um this came through with our conversation
between alex and myself is the fact that this is bigger than people can really imagine
what we're talking about here is is the is is the um what would you call it it's exposing
all of the evil machinations of the deep state somebody finally stands up oh the famous interrupter
sorry somebody finally stands out i'm glad you are now exactly no well thanks well thanks for uh
thanks for you know hey i look again i'm new at this but but thanks for you're not new at this
you reach millions people a week dug your badass no but what you're saying is what is the word i'm
sitting there watching about to eat my lunch is that is it finally somebody's draining the swamp
this is how you do it he's calling their damn bluff he's like john wane but for real
you got four guys lined up against one he says listen you want to five fill your in son of a
bitch dug i'm leaving i'm gonna go in the break room and eat eat lunch take over all right yeah
next time i'll buy lunch next time but but you know alex is right and if you go back through
the progress i guess this is the issue that i'm i'm really just absolutely astounded by when you
look at the uh in the lead up to this day this memo day this infamous february second memo day
when you look up to the lead up to what we have seen what has been exposed how much has been exposed
already that people uh well that people just didn't didn't quite understand or didn't get
i i recall alex doing the uh the uh show with uh william benny about the the well the 99 page
fiza document of course uh or the fiza audit and in that the structured information in that
that led up to today's uh release the classified memo look here's what we're watching i believe
in a nutshell just to kind of bring this home this is really simple we have got in my view anyway
we've got a foreign agent when you look at the memo itself and analyze the memo you've got a foreign
agent christopher steele who absolutely despised the donald trump who was used by the democratic
party by hillary the diane rodham clinton the hillary clinton campaign the dnc the political
supporters in the fbi and the department of justice in an attempt to subvert our presidential
election to subvert the will of the people to this is equivalent to a political assassination
and i know alex has gone through this but this is so important because what we're seeing today is
history in the making the us constitution is not a document that should be shredded and this is
exactly what we saw the the attempted shredding of well the the actual uh uh attack on our constitution
but more importantly and and think about this what what we saw was not just merely
an attempt to change the outcome of an election but it's even bigger than that it's the attempt to
change the trajectory of a nation and when you think about that and let that sink in for a second
it's just not about donald trump it's just not about the republican party or the donald trump
supporters it's about the nation our nation the united states of america it's an attempt to change
the course of our history and by the grace of god almighty that didn't happen and we
does everyone realize how close we came this would have never seen the light of day with a
clinton hillary clinton um in the oval office everything would have been buried but getting
back to what uh alex alex had said uh and talked about the throughout the show to accomplish this
attack we saw the former fbi director and i'm going to get very specific here based on my analysis
of this memo we saw the former fbi director james comey knowingly and will willfully signing off
on a faiza application to spy to wiretap on american citizens obviously donald trump obviously
that his team his campaign staff but during his time as a as an american citizen not yet
elected during his time after uh as a as a republican nominee for president and just an american
citizen during his time as a president elect and even during his time as the president of the united
states it let that sink in consider the ramifications here they deliberately concealed the the actors
behind the faiza warrant application process if we want to focus there the actors there um the the
fact that they lie they there was a material uh the material omissions deliberate omissions
lies by omission lies by commission uh the fact that they were telling the court the faiza court
judge who by the way i'll just i'll just say this i believe that the faiza court judge and i don't
know how many people that have looked at this because the faiza court is a rather small entity
rude off contraris i'll be getting back to that in a second i'll tell you why i believe that to
be the case and just keep that in the back of your mind remember names are important dates are
important uh and names and dates together are extremely important but i'm kind of mapping
this out for you um the the opposition this is not just mere opposition research this was an
attempt to shred the constitution to change the will of the american people and it was exposed
through michael horowitz it was exposed through devon newness and his committee the house intelligence
committee and by the way you've heard alex talk about uh and others on his program talk about
the awan brothers the pakistani spy ring in congress oh you don't think that look that's
got a place in this as well but that's at the periphery of everything you see whether it's
whether it's ben gazi whether it's the pakistani spy ring whether it's the email private servers
whether it's the faiza application warrant um there's more to this this is just the beginning
this three and a half page or three and a quarter page memo that was released today is just the
first shot across across the bow remember this is not the end this is not the the midpoint this
is just the beginning and what what is going to happen next of course is going to be uh as i mentioned
with alex is going to be a there will be blowback an intense blowback but we will be engaged in war
but getting back and i'm i feel like i'm i feel like i got ad d going back through but but look
getting to this faiza memo at the very least we saw deliberate omissions commissions lies by
omission lies by commission perjury at its face appears there to be done by mr comie at the very
least deputy assistant director of the fbi andrew mccabe he knew these facts yet he too proceeded
to engage in this conduct folks you're listening to info wars thug hagman sitting in for alex jones
honored to be doing so this last hour of the show we are going to be back shortly it's a no-brainer

faiza memo has been a trending topic for days because the deep state tried so hard to suppress
it leon macadoo info wars dot com you're listening to the alex jones show defending the republic
from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones president trump released the memo saying that a
lot of people should be ashamed of themselves after unyielding interference by the democrats the four
page newness memo detailing faiza abuse involving the fbi's witch hunt of president donald trump
has been released the washington examiner breaks down the details reporting the steel
dossier formed an essential part of the initial and all three renewal faiza applications against
carter page andrew mccabe confirmed that no faiza warrant would have been sought from the faiza court
without the steel dossier information the political origins of the steel dossier were known to senior
doj and fbi officials but excluded from the faiza applications doj official bruce or met with steel
beginning in the summer of 2016 and relayed to doj information about steels bias steel told or that he
steel was desperate that donald trump not get elected president and was passionate about him
not becoming president the fbi and justice department mounted a month's long effort to keep
the information outlined in the memo out of the house intelligence committee's hands only the
threat of contempt charges and other forms of pressure forced the fbi justice to give up the
material former fbi director james comey referred to the investigators of the memo as weasels and
liars in a tweet last night the hill reports another document an eight page criminal referral
filed with the justice department by senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley
and senator lindsay graham is also part of the gop case now americans can decipher why democratic
representative adam schiff did everything he could to not allow its release including claiming
americans wouldn't understand it to the bizarre claim that it was unlawful due to the correction
of typos um so these changes were not made known to the committee when we voted out the document
uh the document that they produced to the white house is evidently not the same one we voted
on uh and it's just another corruption of the process earlier this week schiff had to inform
his minority party that both the fbi and the doj were officially under investigation by the house
intelligence committee the fbi displayed sheer panic as the walls closed in pleading that they
had grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy
house and senate minority leaders nancy polosi and chuck schumer had blood in their eyes for house
intelligence committee chairman devin newness urging speaker of the house paul ryan to immediately
dismiss newness as intel chairman i do believe that the chairman of the intelligence committee
mr newness should be taken out of that office additionally former fbi deputy director andrew
mccabe stepped down amid the memo turmoil mccabe is being investigated by the office of special
counsel on whether mccabe's activities supporting his wife jill's democratic campaign for virginia
state senate in 2015 violated the hatchax prohibition against fbi agents campaigning in partisan races
according to cirka news a glaring example of the arrogance of the top brass assuming they're above
the law and fbi director christ for rey has been under pressure by former fbi pro russian narrative
pushers to step down rey is quietly making the threat to step down on his own accord to be willing
to quit or be fired at a moment's notice in order to stand up for what you think is right
the panic is widespread now americans can pour the drain oh for themselves right into that drain
clogging the swamp john bound reporting for info wars dot com what a fantastic report what a
fantastic report for info wars did you catch all of that the complete look i'll tell you something
um in my capacity as as an investigator for the last 30 years when i looked when i look at that
report and i see all of the moving parts within this isn't that doesn't it amaze you as it amazes
me the fact that that we are told as americans for example that one part saying that that we are too
stupid to understand what's in that memo and of course then of course when that didn't fly too
well they come out and they say hey wait a minute you're giving away sources and methods in this
memo by releasing this memo grave concerns and then you've got christopher rey supposedly one
of the good guys coming out and saying well you know what look i'll step aside but you know i'm
really not on board with this i want to point something out and this was the subject of i
do two radio shows one in the morning and one in my flight or flagship show at night and this is
something i pointed out uh in my morning show the fbi threatened president donald trump
and i know that's that's a pretty broad statement to make but when you take a look at the uh the
subsequent to when this report was completed and sent to the president for his his for him
to sign off and of course they've got five days of easy at five days to sign off and then send it
back to the house during that time period when we pay very close attention and i know alex had
covered this in in previous programs there was a visit by the fbi agents to president donald trump
the contingent of or not agents but a contingent of brass of the fbi to express their concerns
actually to general kelly the chief of staff to express their concerns over the release of this
memo that's a pretty significant threat combined with what you saw from that excellent report from
info wars um the uh uh christopher ray saying well you know i could step down i'd be really happy
to step down we are watching the uh in at least in my view based on everything that we've seen here
and as as illustrated through that report we're watching this uh this experience soap opera
tragedy play out where you've got a the coup of the one-time palace guard uh a coup that is still
in progress where you have deep state actors still entrenched within the permanent state
the bureaucracy including but not limited to the department of justice in the fbi paying donald
trump's chief of staff making a visit there saying you know what don't release this memo
what we're seeing i believe from that visit and from the excellent report that we just heard and
saw where we are seeing the pushback the beginning of the pushback and don't forget of course there's
that uh multiple page longer democratic response and of course we know and alex talks about this
and we talk about this this is no longer republican democrat this is deep state versus non-deep state
actors that's what this is all about you you cannot ascribe any deer or after the names of the people
involved but this is still taking place i i really i can't say this enough i can't stress this enough
and alex has done a great job and then painting this picture along with mr benny and others
this is still going on the palace coup or the coup the deep state coup is still taking place
and i had mentioned right before the break where uh the uh what you recall the reference to the secret
society tongue-in-cheek perhaps some say that reference in the struck page text was that a tongue
in cheek reference and then of course uh ron johnson uh kind of seemingly walking that back
after talking about it but here's the issue and info wars was one of the first to report on this
i was in fact alex uh and i were talking about this back months ago ed kline reported on this
in his book all out war four different branches of the uh four different field offices of the fbi
involved in conducting surveillance of members of the federal bureaucracy uh individuals within
the federal government meeting at different locations including a church outside of washington
dc where they gathered to talk about how to best impede the forward progress of
donald trump now think about that let that sink in for a second
you've got the the white hats in the fbi exposing the machinations the nefarious actions
of those embedded in the bureaucracy it's incredible and this is still going on folks

right thank you alex jones for allowing me to sit in what an honor it is to be able to host the
final hour of info wars hopefully i'm doing okay if not just uh you can be you can fire me but
i'll be right before the break we're talking about the report that was shown of course the
democratic response and the fact that uh the report that that that was put together by
enforce a fantastic report about how the even the american people would not understand the
actual memo once released and how we are being talked down to there's a clip from uh jim heims
as a matter of fact there's a 42nd clip if we can play that now that kind of gets into the
claims of the memo as a second rate hit job can we go ahead and play that it's uh it's a series of
unfounded and out of context attacks on the department of justice on the fbi and a number of
individuals by the way most of whom are republicans some of whom are trump appointees accusing them
of bias and you know i'm never a fan you know chairman goodlots said let's let the public know
this is a memo that is based on highly classified information uh the public's not in a position
any more than the committee was anderson we were not afforded the opportunity to review the underlying
intelligence when the memo was presented to us nonetheless this memo is of such low quality
that when it is out there people will very rapidly see that this is just the latest installment of
second rate efforts to uh to impugn the fbi all right that was jim heims talking to anderson cooper
did you note the the uh the condescension in his voice of course uh but also trying to minimize the
fact that this this memo is really it's there's nothing to it nothing to it at all if there's
nothing to it then then why the outcry why the outrage why in fact talk down to us why
make us feel like first of all we're not entitled to it and even if we would be entitled to it
well gee whiz we wouldn't understand it in any way so what this the bottom line here as i wrap up
in this uh guest hosting spot of the bottom line here is what we're seeing obviously
via this document at its face we're seeing that there appears to be at least from my my reading
of this perjury by mr comey this is my viewpoint now this is my assessment there appears to be
well when you look at deputy assistant director of the fbi andrew mccabe he knew of the facts yet
he was too uh yet he too proceeded to uh to engage in the conduct that's outlined in the report
itself in the memo itself and remember folks this is just the first the first of many to come out
the fact that deputy attorney general uh deputy attorney general celly yates appears to have known
this yet she too participated in these acts deputy attorney general rod rosinstein appears to have
also known these facts but yet continued forward think about this the fact in short
at the the absolute highest levels of the fbi and the u.s. department of justice
they're terrifyingly unbelievably corrupt and co-opted by a political ideology that being of
course the the democratic the dnc but most importantly the progressives the ideology
that the progressives now i'd mentioned right before the break about my sources telling me
and of course it'd be it being in the book all out war and of course when i appeared with alex
jones before about these meetings and the reference to secret societies right before the last break
look what we see going on uh what we see outlined in this particular memo it's still going on the
corruption is still going on the the uh this attempt to take over to shred to usurp our
constitution to take take out donald trump take it to to subvert the will of the people
it's still going on if it wasn't would we wouldn't we see more uh heavy-handed uh tactics uh firing
of of individuals within the department of justice within the fbi yet we see uh bruce or
okay demoted still there right where's he at uh how about rosenstein how about all of the others
named herein i want to draw your attention to something else as well uh something that before
i forget i want to mention i've talked about this on my morning show evalyn farkas the assistant
deputy director of the department of defense appeared on msnbc not too long ago now i don't
have the clip here we don't have the clip here to play it but but she had said something extremely
interesting and i think it's important she had said that uh after donald trump won she appeared on
on msnbc i believe it was on march 2nd i'm going from memory now where she had said that she was
very concerned about the donald trump uh transition team and the that the administration finding out
exactly what the previous regime the previous administration did with respect to the um uh
the spying and the illegal wiretapping and how the phrase she was concerned about how them finding
out how how um um how they knew what they knew in other words speaking to the methods of the
surveillance if you can kind of a homework assignment for the viewers and listeners look up
evalyn farkas f a r k a s msnbc from march 2nd i believe it was of 2017 and listen to that that
that's a short clip as a homework assignment and listen to exactly what she says it's incredible
because they have spilled their hand in this and as alex jones talks about and and all of his
excellent reporters talk about and guests talk about we are seeing this play out one of the most
important stories of our lifetime play out right before our very eyes this cannot be understated
understated this memo and as alex jones had talked uh at length about with mr benny and others look
this is just it's not even the tip of the iceberg this is just the the first lob of a uh
of a ball across the net this is just the very first of more to come expect deep state blowback
expect that count on it we need to pray for donald trump we need to keep him in our prayers we need
to keep him in our thoughts and we need to support him because this is not just about donald trump
it's much bigger than that it's about each and every one of us it's about the rule of law it's
about the constitution but it's kind of wrapping up with with respect to the memo the three and a
quarter page three and a half page whatever we're going to call it memo the current deputy attorney
general rod rosinstein knowing the allegations about the russian collusion knowing that they're
fraudulent think about this still appointed meuller robert s meuller the third as special counsel
knowing everything and this of course to investigate the trump administration for russia for russian
for russian collusion he knew that never took place the whole investigation is based on a fraud
this is based on a sting operation that's exactly what it is an attempt to sting donald trump and
by and by extension each and every one of us folks you're listening to the you're listening to info
