live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones okay we've
got live feeds out of the other studio with Owen shroyer giving you live
analysis and coverage and then he's collating all the highlights of the
unbelievable ongoing press conference that's been happening for over an hour
with the Russian president Vladimir Putin and the US president Donald J
Trump unbelievable bombshell after bombshell we've already got some of the
clips grabbed one of them was five minutes ago and it was Putin going
listen our intelligence services aren't involved these are private Russian
companies that all sorts of companies hire which 80% of the bots bought were
for Hillary out of Russia that's what happens during elections people go
overseas and go around campaign finance law because listen you've got George
Soros inside the United States trying to steal elections for Hillary Clinton and
then right before that a few minutes before Trump comes out and says hey
what about Hillary and her 30,000 emails we're changing the subject to whoever
hacked those she shouldn't have illegally had those on her private server
see how they changed the subject and of course Putin's come out and denied that
they were involved in election manipulation says they're insulted if
anything RT is leftist in fact RT's horrible now it's unwatchable the the
the sycophantic worship of anti-Trump stuff the and it's always been leftist
I mean the claim that it's this anti-Hillary machine that CIA report they
put out a year and a half ago that showed 20 something examples of them
having negative coverage of Hillary yeah they had probably thousands of Trump I
mean RT if anything it's like our mainstream media it's it's it's very
very leftist that's a side issue though this is a huge broadcast we have a bunch
of these clips for you the live press conference is ongoing and then we've
done something very very special with Mike Adams and Paul Watson and the rest
the team that has a real chance of blunting internet censorship and the
whole globalist plan to silence nationalist Christians patriots you name
it and that's coming up as well there is a detailed 50 plus page PDF on info
wars dot com right now the censorship master plan decoded the Adams report
and then Paul Watson has another detailed report that details this this is for
Congress and the president I can tell you right now it is being sent to the
president as we speak to their horror and this is how they're doing it how
they admit they're doing it and how they think we're stupid and how they can be
easily stopped so you want to put a stop to this make this go viral send it to
every congressperson they're having hearings on this tomorrow no one has put
together a blueprint well with info wars Mike Adams has done it of natural news
dot com you'll be joining us the second hour but right now let's go out to break
with Vladimir Putin just minutes ago we have more of these clips coming up from
the Helsinki Finland here is Putin throwing down the gauntlet about
manipulation this company does not constitute the Russian state it does not
represent the Russian state I brought several examples before well you have a
lot of individuals in the United States take George Soros for instance with
multi-billion capitals but it does that make him his position his posture the
posture of the United States no it does not but it's the same case there is the
issue of trying a case in the court and the final the final say is for the court
to deliver we are now talking about the private in the individuals and not about
particular states and as far as the most recent allegation is concerned about
the Russian intelligence officers we do have an intergovernmental treaty please
do send us the request we will analyze it properly we're gonna come back more
of this where Trump calls out Hillary but just understand this Putin just gave
you the truthful answer that there are all these bot companies all over the
world that for PR anybody can hire there are a bunch of them Russia and even the
congressional reports say Michael Moore went to a Russian bot protest of Trump

live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
you better look out globalist because we're fighting back and we're winning
better watch out Hillary better watch out Sasha Barrett Cohen you better watch
out Michael Moore you better watch out globalist because we're fighting back
50,000 unstoppable watts all right let's get into it right now the historic
Trump Putin summit is taking place that took over a year and a half of him being
president to happen when it should have been the third or fourth meeting yet
should have met with the UK should have met with the EU should have met with the
Chinese should have met with the Russians should have met with the Japanese
should have met with the Mexican president and Trump did all those meetings
in the right order but Russia and then I was just thinking today about how Trump
has been kicking the Russians in the ribs breaking their nose smashing their
head in the ground and then how the media Brian Stelter and others we're gonna
play this clip coming up the next segment said everything Trump's telling you is a
lie you can't trust him he's your enemy and of course what you're hearing is the
inverse 100% about Stelter who just reeks of being disingenuous and has a
known fraud but that's the unified thing they're putting out the truth is Trump
sees everybody as a competitor to the US and if anything one of his only
failings is letting the military industrial complex stampede him into
showing folks how tough he is on Russia when in the aggregate they are not one
one-hundredth as expansionist as communist China or not one-tenth as big a
threat our relationship has never been worse with Russia probably even during
the Cold War Trump's correct he said the EU's our adversary they are our foe
financially they are trying to bankrupt us Yunker said that a year and a half
ago he said I'll bankrupt America they're out live with the chai comms
Russia is not out live with the EU the EU is an authoritarian unelected
monstrosity Trump would not have done this I think if he didn't have to quote
show the world that he's not really a Russian agent and I think that is one
of the only failings of the president is that he let them bully him into not
having an earlier meeting but this has happened now and it's a good thing but
if you look at everything that's happened the the massive energy production
increases in the US that crushes Russia the moving tow missiles into Ukraine
something Obama wouldn't do giving him anti-tank missiles to attack the Russian
forces in the east of Ukraine that's always been Russia that's where Russia
was founded backing really Soros's operation that he bragged he launched
four years ago on Fareed Zarkaria and CNN that they overthrew the elected
government of Ukraine and spent five billion US tax dollars to do it and then
all Russia did was come into the eastern area of Crimea that's 99%
basically Russian speaking and has always been part of Russia except during
World War two when Hitler took it over and the Russians have no other choice
they weren't attacked they were invaded people call me a roosa file now I'm a
truth-a-file ladies and gentlemen I like to tell the truth makes my job a lot
easier just to research the facts know what the facts are and then go with
those doesn't mean I lionized Russia or Putin or any of this but as Putin pointed
out just minutes ago we're gonna play the clip you're accusing 12 Russian
intelligence operatives of being behind box these are private companies that
anybody can hire to do PR and Russia is not even in the top 10 of being hired
for PR the US is number one China is number two and the different EU
companies are number three the UK is very dominant in it for the size of their
population 80 million people in fact we said per capita the UK probably does
more PR than anybody and you can hire them for anything and 80% roughly of all
bots were for Hillary and they came from New Zealand they came from Russia they
came you could go hijack somebody's computer in Russia zombie computer happens
to millions computers a day and then attack the US with it and they could
say oh look Russia attacked us and that's in the vault seven documents that
came out last year where the CIA would go play stuff on Russian computers to
attack the US that's the oldest trick in the book Russia just cut defense
spending Russia says they want an economic posture of development they want
championships they want world fairs they want industrial building they want
shopping malls they want organic farms they've decided not to play
China is absolutely saying they're gonna take us over and are in a state of
war against us and their official newspapers and I 100% support the
president getting in China's face hitting him with massive tariffs and
beefing up our military in those areas space command you name it to deal with
them because they are threatening us and expanding that 97% of rare earth
minerals and admit they're strangling the US and they bought up Hollywood China
is buying up with several Islamic groups the UFC I mean we are being bought up
there are biggest debt holders it's the chai comms the chai comms the chai comms
the chai comms the chai comms the Russia is a diversion Russia is just seen as
weak economically so the globalists are in there trying to destabilize it and
take it just like the EU took over the UK and now they voted two years ago to get
out of it and now Theresa May says sorry we're not even gonna do Brexit now she
announced that today so it's on ladies and gentlemen it's on in every way
Trump goes the EU and says we pay for half of it we pay for half a NATO you
have to pay for it they go okay we'll increase our spending they already did
once that's a victory Trump goes over it says the EU is our economic foe it's
true he sits in Churchill's chair they call him a trader saying you didn't
beat the Nazis don't sit in his chair when he was invited to sit in the famous
chair at the museum but it is Trump fighting the EU that was a Nazi project
it is Trump fighting for sovereignty it is Trump standing up for the nation
state so if anybody he should be sitting in Winston Churchill's chair but it
shows how they create these false narratives constantly so we're gonna go
over all of this got a bunch of the clips coming up Trump called out Hillary
for her server said this whole thing about Russians is a diversion she had
any legal server that a bunch of countries got into but here's Putin on
George Soros is involved he's the one spending tens of billions per election
publicly he's the one trying to overthrow Russia here it is but this
company does not constitute the Russian state it does not represent the Russian
state I brought several examples before well you have a lot of individuals in
the United States take George Soros for instance with multi-billion capitals
but it does that make him his position his posture the posture of the United
States no it does not but it's the same case there is the issue of trying a case
in the court and the final the final say there's Putin saying oh go ahead and
try it in your court see if my agents were involved because he knows they
already filed that fake lawsuit six months ago shank 13 Russian bots and
now the court has demanded proof and now the Russian companies have shown up and
shown the proof that they were actually being paid by Hillary they're like
almost all our orders were for Hillary we got Michael Moore to go to an
anti-prompt protest we're just mercenaries we'll take anybody's money
what do you mean we're Russian agents and the judge is like I'm gonna throw
this out so Mueller files a new thing on 12 men and women to try to keep the
whole ball rolling a fraud stay with us we'll be right back

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the n-word would you
support a group that hits women and disabled veterans and attacks minorities
and transgenders would you support a group that intimidates the public with
weapons of war what if that same group had been caught lobby explosives into a
crowd of innocent people I wouldn't support that group would you this has been a
public service announcement from info wars.com
crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
you live from the front lines of the info war okay coming up Owen shroyer is
coming in studio with the highlights of the hour-and-a-half long press conference
with the president Trump and president Putin unbelievably important things were
said and done I've said all the facts what Putin said is true from the best
research we've got that Hillary had three billion dollars Trump had 500
million Trump bought almost no bots some private companies bought bots and
there's a bunch of companies in Russia that you can buy bots for and
congressional studies have shown right at 80% funny Hillary at 80% of the money
and 80% of the bots just surprise surprise that's how math works and then
it came out that it was for Hillary and that's why the Russian companies have
gladly shown up in court and said here's our files here's who paid us D&C
George Soros Soros spends billions a year of his own money in Russia running
anti-Putin anti-Russia operations he bragged on TV that he gave a billion to
the five billion that the State Department we have the State Department
head at the time saying they did it on C-SPAN set six billion dollars to
overthrow Ukraine an elected government Putin did not invade the Ukraine
eastern Ukraine has always been part of Russia it's where it was founded like
like like like like New York and Pennsylvania that's where Russia was
founded his in an encyclopedia it says that go to the history of Russia the
founding of Russia in any encyclopedia it'll tell you that it was founded in
Crimea and Russia's had eight major wars over it the last time Hitler took
it from them and so they never got all of Ukraine back because yes Western
Ukraine was Catholic and more aligned with the Germans and the Poles and did
the Russians abuse East Western Ukraine a lot you bet your bottom dollar the
Zars did and you bet your bottom dollar at the same time so did the communist the
Russians did horrible things to the Ukrainians that's not debated even by
the Russians but that's a whole nother world back then ladies and gentlemen and
they think people are so stupid now let me see yeah there's there's associated
press George Soros the puppet master behind the new Ukrainian regime unbelievable
show Putin brought that up but I'm gonna shift years now and get back into that
the next segment and all this other incredible world news a couple big
tidbits here because I don't have time to toot my horn but if you list in the
thousands of articles I've seen the last week saying ban info wars ban Alex
Jones from the internet USA Today New York Times Washington Post they used the
example of Alex Jones says Anthony Bourdain was murdered and that's fake
news and Alex Jones says that there would be a giant civil war on July 4th
now I said the Democrats are calling for a civil war professors and USA Today say
we're in one and I see this is the mark of when they're gonna intensify their
attacks and their behavior which has happened so they misrepresented let's
get back to this real quick I'm gonna play more of this later there were
thousands of articles saying how dare Alex Jones say Anthony Bourdain was gonna
come out and call Bill Clinton a rapist and say that he hoped that Harvey
Weinstein would die deserve the death penalty and that he was aware of giant
sex trafficking going on because his fiance the word is they're basically
married his Italian fiance at least when she was there with him on the set
that's what they were calling her that she was aware as her dad's a famous
director who reportedly was involved in some of this and that because he learned
about all this he was going to go public and was doing interviews with Elon
Musk and others word for word it's all in the Daily Mail today in a nine page
article the girlfriend how she was abused sex cults Harvey Weinstein needs
to die Bill Clinton's a rapist word for word please pull up YouTube just type in
Alex Jones Anthony Bourdain please and you will get the videos and again
showing how we don't chew their own horn which is a problem I got up this
morning saw that info wars had the headline oh the Daily Mail's breaking
that he was about to do a Kanye West our own people who I loved to death think
so let's just say calmly about ourselves we're so shy that none of us would
even say I was right here's the video learn what Anthony Bourdain was planning
to say before he died and then you watch the 34 minute live video I did and I
say everything you just read in the Daily Mail word for word he gave an
interview that has been unpublished in February he was then interviewed by
multiple filmmaking crews in March and April he owned his own production
company and he got more informed as the months went on and the whole Kanye
West thing happened and he went from hating Trump to being neutral on Trump
and then suddenly became pro-trump and they killed him within 24 hours I've
talked to the people that were in the meetings and you notice I warned him at
the time I said you come out and say I'm a liar or the rest of the media will we
got access to the Elon Musk Bourdain tape and I told everybody this is not what
stuff gets you killed
yeah show his fiance show her she's in the Daily Mail article which I list
everything and now how did I know all this word for word because I had one
source then I contacted another source and I know other individuals that were
good friends with Bourdain and they said yeah he's been really freaked out he's
learned all about the Illuminati all about the sex traffic all about the
little kids being grabbed he's learned it all from his fiancee whose dad's a
famous director in Europe and she reportedly was abused we won't get into
by who but it I was told all of it and then word for word exactly what I tell
you comes out and I'm the bad guy my old friend Joe Rogan Alex is full of
crap on this you know thousands of publications no I'm not full of crap
I told the truth again because it's my job to tell the truth and I'm gonna keep

fiber get yours today info wars life.com living in volcano may sound more
dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani
estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to
be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to
find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what
we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity
filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH
was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa
pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and
acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
water filtration system will purify it
you're listening to the alex jones show
imagine a time traveler came and warned you everything he said was proven
right from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
the year is 1995 and info wars launches the last of america's counter globalist
probes in a freak mishap info wars.com and alex jones are blown out of their

alex jones to earth 25 years later. Transdimensionally over the spacetime
continuum through full space where people are extremely lazy the social
engineers are there laughing what we envisioned a hundred years ago 20 years
ago is now real. While the society unravels men run around totally frantic

info wars tomorrow's news today. Here we are ladies and gentlemen
all right coming up in the next segment Owen shoyer is going to be in studio
then next hour Mike Adams is going to be joining us. What we have put together
and what I'm about to announce will defeat the attempt to end the First
Amendment here in the United States and to roll back free speech in Europe and
across the world if you accept this mission just like we've already changed
the world together as listeners and viewers as the folks that have gotten
around the sensors gotten around the algorithms to find info wars.com
forward slash show to find info wars.com forward slash app to find info
wars.com forward slash newsletter. If you accept this mission 100 percent we
will beat them that's not bragging that's fact now my horror is that this
will just be more chatter out there and it won't penetrate through to all your
minds because I need every one of you no matter how old you are or what color you
are or where you're from to get this report for free at info wars.com at
naturalnews.com and news wars.com and to get it out because let me explain
something no one has written a report detailing the blueprint and the
admission of the big tech companies the EU the Democratic Party Hollywood and
their admitted plan with the news core news core was in the Wall Street Journal
five months ago remember and they are the only other people to actually blueprint
it and they said we're gonna start by banning WikiLeaks and Alex Jones when
we're done we're gonna ban everybody off the web and control everything and only
let you see messages we want you to see from a few dozen companies they said
maybe a hundred sources and they're doing it and it's here they've gone from
30 40% of conservatives post being censored just automatically during the
campaign to 90 percent now Facebook came out last week and admitted the exact
number I've given you of 80% because we can see the algorithm we have access to
the Facebook login to the Google login we can see it in a lifetime two days
after Hillary was defeated our graph went like from straight up to straight
down and they admitted they just blocked it we have to go to the page to find it
and now they're all in the news calling for us to totally be banned from the web
from any other platform and admitting that they'd already been strangling us
but that's all in this report now imagine you're the president imagine your
Congress you're busy there's a hearing about internet censorship of
conservatives diamonds and silk come in diamond and silk they get yelled at the
whole time of the Democrats nothing happens the Republicans seem ignorant
they don't know what's going on this is how Republican congressmen and women
who try to put their own campaign announcements on Facebook or Twitter get
banned but the Democrats are allowed to this is how Facebook and Twitter are
already dialing back the president and admitting that they shadow banned the
president so you have to be on his page to get his Twitter alerts I point that
out everybody goes yeah I don't get them I've got to go to his site I've got to go
to his page it's the company brads they're doing it they said six months
ago and a statement don't worry about us banning him we already blocking and I
talked to high-level people in the campaign you name it they're not even
aware of this so they say listen give us a report I talked to people at the
Capitol they said I was aware where a lot of this give us the report because
thinking people know we're light years ahead the media tries to ridicule
info wars and say we're fake news and misrepresent we say all day because they
tune in and go my god this guy's got the blueprint to the Death Star take him out
now good lord if people pay attention to this we're done so I started asking Paul
Watson last week I said they want a big email list of all the news articles and
all the quotes and statements and how they're shadow banning and how they're
doing it and what we think we should do to counter them I'm like anti-trust
investigations will get them to stop doing it real quick that right there
will make them back off but they need to be busted up and we need to expose the
rack of tearing we need to expose how Google Facebook Twitter brag that we're
owned by the Democrats and we're delivering all the votes to Hillary and
no one can stop us that was in the news during the campaign so you talk about
collusion what about big tech collusion just like mainstream media against
Trump so that's all in a 50 plus page PDF that's on info wars.com linked in the
articles emergency report the censorship master plan decoded it's linked to the
article on info wars.com there's also a Paul Watson report that's an excellent
boil down of the report for people that don't want to read 50 something pages with
all the exhibits now Mike started writing this last Wednesday and he said
engineer best-selling author all-around scientist very successful as everyone
knows and Mike did an excellent job putting the report out working with Paul
and myself but it was a collaborative effort but I would say 80% of the work
goes to Mike but this isn't about credit it's about defeating these monsters so
we have Paul's boil down report that's six pages we have Mike's that is 60 plus
pages all right there for you on info wars.com you're like well I already

about his tweeters they don't understand this and the electronic frontier

anti-free speech engines all of this and so they're coming for everybody info

set the precedent to de-platform us don't let companies publish our books
don't let us have venues to have speeches this is like China and their
social score where you then get put in an electronic gulag that Matt Drudge
coined the term of and warned us in studio two and a half years ago so we're
here Hillary was gonna carry all this out it's like Merkel has in Europe but
Trump got in so we've bought some time but it doesn't mean we're winning we're

rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones
oh shroyers here with us for a couple segments and Mike Adams is gonna join us
on the confirmed plan to end internet freedom as we know it the unbelievable
arrogant statements about how we're too dumb to understand it and then no one
thought to collate it no one thought to put it together nobody thought to do it
we've done it just like nobody thought to try to relaunch americana against
globalism that info wars did it over the last 20 years and the listeners did it
and so we're now winning on that front people understand we're selling victory
we're selling what works we're selling the real McCoy the bona fides the bones
and the guts the real thing man not not not not not vapor and that's why we
win if we take the field we don't take the field we lose the report is on info
wars dot com it is critical critical critical critical critical critical
critical and read our own report check it for yourself write your own report
but they're coming for your free speech they admit we're the beta test to shut
you up my god there's articles out where mainline Christian bands can't have
videos on Facebook about everyone coming together and loving each other that was
banned by Facebook this weekend world met daily reported saying it's political
they don't like Christians they've taken Christianity off the Apple and off the
Google calendars this year they mean business folks they mean business
they're coming for you so they want to go oh I don't want to be censored I better
comply with the censorship and then I watch all all these all these fake
conservatives that they bring in their little darlings with Brian Stelter and
you know darlings when they go on Bill Maher I'm a big fan you know says says
our anointed leader Ben Shapiro and others when they're just there to control
us there to be the last conservatives the only ones that are allowed to have a
voice and we all bow down to them oh you don't get censored you get force fed to
the front page of YouTube just like Sasha Baron Cohen or just like Michael
Moore it's force fed whatever's on the front page remember they're making you
look at is the enemy historic times though I want Royer well I think considering
what you just talked about and the censorship you know it's not necessarily
take what you just said about Christian channels on YouTube being shut down well
you know you can Facebook and Facebook and Twitter and everywhere you know it
was it was much a white black and Hispanic people hugging each other saying we
love each other we're not racist we love God but here's what I think the
audience that doubts what's really going on needs to to ask themselves why do
you see this type of behavior against Christians whereas if this type of
censorship was happening to Muslim individuals it would be the number one
story in the world how dare you censor Muslims how dare you be anti-Islamic so
if you don't think it's going on fine but how do you explain the contrast in
the way that Christians are treated on social media but they admit they are
now here's here's the world net daily article they called it a political ad it
was a music video Zion's Joy pull it up and it's a multiracial group of
Christians loving each other that's what they don't like is people coming
together that's what they hate is unity and you can see that they hate that
because they love to stand up for women and minorities that is until those women
or minorities have conservative values and they toss you to the curb they think
they own you so I don't think but here's the problem Alex people can you know
this people can see the facts and that's not going to change them I can't
explain it I see the fact I respond the the 20 to 30% of the sheeple in this
country that go out in the streets refuse the facts and they're not going to
fight for free speech because they don't see it's under attack that's why it's so
important for our audience to take this battlefield and to fight for free speech
because so many Americans don't see it as it's the whole you know I forget how
the saying goes but you know they came for the Jews I said nothing because I'm
not Jewish they came with the Catholics and finally they came for me and there
was nobody to stand up that's how this works and they admit in thousands of
articles last week we're banning Jones and once he's banned everyone else will
be banned but why would they want to ban you Alex why is it info wars that is so
dangerous oh is that because your exclusive on Anthony Bourdain came out
to be true oh is that because you were right when you told them that Saudi
Arabians were involved in 9-11 see they want control over information Alex
that's what this really comes down to they could care less whether Joe Schmo
out there has a Twitter account and can say whatever he wants it's about
controlling information and if Alex Jones doesn't exist to put the
exclusives out there like Anthony Bourdain's he said he was afraid of Bill
Clinton but he was still going to go public calling him a rapist and hope
that Weinstein would die and then he now was about to go public and then that
was that I know people that were in the interviews a month after he'd really
woken up see this interview was from February just now released and isn't
this a personification of everything we're dealing with Alex if you don't
fight you're going to die and I'm not saying that Anthony Bourdain did or
didn't fight I'm saying he's now dead he was he was he was he was a he had a
fiance who had been abused and he was exposed who'd been raped by Weinstein
he had found out from her about her dad a big director and about the whole
underworld and the sex rituals this is this is public I talked to people that
were there at the meetings with him out in the countryside of Morocco for two
days while they were drinking sangria and then I talked to other people they
go no that's true he was really pissed and about to go public he was a real
liberal he was upset about the wrong things and he saw Kanye and everything
else even in this interview he goes to being neutral on Trump from hating but
see a few months later he was now got it and they go we're not letting Anthony
Bourdain the hero to the left come out against us because he was going to come
out because he wasn't a wimp he was going to come out and attack the left he
was going to attack the establishment and they said we're not no no if they
get this guy one of our own people to turn against us we're done and the
Clintons looked at the calculation and said getter than a hammer and then you
saw thousands of articles say that I was wrong and I was a liar you just think
I go on air and say he owned his own production company he owned starting in
February according to my sources which now word for word is confirmed months
later a month plus later word for word ladies and gentlemen word for word word
for word then he got progressively more awake and they he owned the final cut
just like eyes wide shut I was Stanley Kubrick they cut 24 minutes out of it
I know is in 24 minutes his daughter told me his protege the only person his
family he liked and help direct his last films I mean I've been sworn to
secrecy what I was told there I almost don't even want to know this stuff but
if I'd have been better known before I was told I wouldn't want to know it I
know about the NASA stuff I know about Dr. Strangelove I know about full metal
jacket I know about I know about all of it for two days I was briefed on it let
me take something all hell broke loose after I was given that information well
let me tell you before Trump even showed up on the scene that's when hell
broke loose four and a half years ago against me was when Vivian Kubrick told
me all this stuff about the whole thing and it was stuff already knew and that
was what was so crazy and I'm just stopping right there we got to come back
and Mike Adams is waiting but we've got to get to these few clips and I'm sure
he'll be fine with it he's a awesome guy I've joined us via Skype but I know I'm
ranting your own it's just people understand I didn't just get up here and
say he was gonna come out and say Weinstein's a rapist and right my my
fiance and Bill Clinton's a rapist and Jerry Epstein's a rapist and they used
child kidnapping to control people I was on the phone with people that had video
of it they have the video you know to CNN kept their fat mouth shut because I
told him I said CNN you say I'm a liar on this I'm gonna release it they kept
their fat mouth shut but all their surrogates attacked this and said we
were liars so again we're right again it's all in the Daily Mail how he was
scared of the Clintons how they were a bunch of rapists how they were and that
was in February this interview people were so scared in February they never
published this they had to check with Weinstein and people we have all their
spies in New York she was okay and see what happened they got enough pings back
down their spider web that Bourdain was getting loose from the web that they
ran in and went ahead and ate him before his soul got away from him they think
well and again where are the apologies to Alex Jones for reporting the facts
just for having the chutzpah to come out here and report this which other
people may or may not have known the point is that you said it Alex and they
came out and they attacked you for it you got vindicated once again so so you
know I know that you're not you don't want apologies you do this because this
is just getting the truth out there and that's your mission but it's just like
it's gonna happen again and then Salon will attack and media matters will
attack and David Brock and they'll all attack you and it's just like whoa you
know a month later it all comes up true where's the apology oh I'm sorry I
shouldn't expect an apology from Salon that endorses pedophilia and notice
thousands thousands came out the taping for the Bourdain thing Jones claims he
was killed by the Clintons I said I was told by smart people he was getting
ready to go public against him and that he was scared and that he was basically
hiding out but see that he had this whole crisis of contrasts because of his
fiance who told him everything I was told by people that were at the meetings
about him telling him about rituals and everything yeah he she needs to go
public yeah he's in danger his wife put it all on social media I mean she she
tweets all this stuff out she knows what's going on let's come back and get
to all the highlights of the Putin Trump meeting we'll come back I'm just have

bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at info wars.com
forward slash news letter we are the renaissance and we are winning. You're
listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war
it's Alex Jones. Alright Mike Adams is coming up in 15 minutes with a mission
that if you choose to accept it in fact when we intro Mike we play mission
impossible I think it's in the computer the old original one or maybe the
modern one but this is a mission very easy to win we have them
arrogantly bragging that they're censoring conservatives Christians and
plan a total takeover of the web the next few months and we have a blueprint
stop it so that's coming up but next segment this is a short time we're
gonna get to the Putin-Trump press conference the media freaking out Ryan
Stelter all of it but just you came in at 4 a.m. with Rob doing the rest of
crew you covered it all give people a briefing before we play these clips of
what you witnessed. Well I think first off the fact that Putin and Trump were
able to finally sit down in private and have the one-on-one meeting it's really
probably immeasurable as to how important that is because Alex as you
know they the globalists and the deep state of America they want their eyes
they want their ears they want their fingertips they want their noses all
over any so they can misquote it and so that they can manipulate it too well
they don't control Putin that's why they hate him say whatever you want about
Putin it's true he's not controlled by the globalist and they don't control
Trump he's not part of their secret societies not in their sex cults so now
you have not an admin sexual little boys now you have the two most I mean you
could I guess debate this but my opinion the two most powerful men in the
world Donald Trump and Vladimir don't like to have sexual kids and who aren't
in sex cults meeting one-on-one and the globalist have no clue what's going on
Kissinger has no idea what's going on Clinton has no idea what's going on
Obama has no idea what's going on Erdogan has no idea what's going on then
you go down the list right so they're panicked Alex because they don't know
what they're saying they know they're running a Psyop right now claiming that
Russia is hacking the election so what does Putin do Putin says okay well I'll
tell you what why don't you enlist our ministry our agencies and let's dig into
this together let's find out who actually hacks them so now and this is just I
mean there were so many now Putin says we're gonna send our people to your
court they're gonna land on planes you're not gonna be we're gonna come and
show you that Hillary buying bots in Russia but but you think about it Alex
and the honestly the whole thing was bombshell but but how can this is how
empty it really is Robert Mueller how can he possibly indict 12 Russians for
hacking the servers that he's never investigated that no one's ever
investigated Trump brought it up Putin brought it up so it's gonna be the
second time Russia is gonna have legal representation in the FBI try to get in
the DMC servers we're gonna place clip 22 times they're like hiding the servers
going the Russians are in it but you can't look at them if you like if I said
if you like if I said my wife ran off into the night hypothetically and is
missing but let me see but then I don't call the cops when it happens I just
tell him later oh she just ran away no your wife runs off crazy middle of the
night you call the police it's like oh I have the servers but no yeah oh your
wife ran off all right we're gonna come investigate your house no don't come in
my house but she's not here but don't come in and so so they already demanded
discovery for the original indictments Mueller balked didn't show up made some
bogus claim he didn't have enough evidence that was just a bot and you
never indict someone until you have all the evidence so that's a lie so here's
what's gonna happen Alex they're gonna show up in court they're gonna demand
discovery and Mueller's gonna get caught with his tail between his legs and
they're either gonna be forced to turn over the servers or they're gonna have
egg on their face when they're like well we're not gonna turn over the servers
you eat servers you want evidence to go screw you well that's why they drop the
Roger Stone Trump suits saying they're Russian agencies okay we want to access
those servers it's all made up we're Russian agents like we're again
Martians from Pluto man we're Americans well let's not look at the country
coming back but now they see now it's the whole thing attack Putin demonize
Putin indict the Russians you know oh this vindicates things now that they
indicted another fake group of indictments by the crooks that have been
caught in their emails and text messages saying we're gonna keep him from
getting elected we're gonna kick him out of office we've got a manufacturer stuff
we're frauds it's all food of the poison tree they're so the whole thing should be
dropped I mean if listen if they caught detectives in a in a in a murder trial
in emails or text messages saying we got to set these people up we got to make
sure they go to jail it's over they're guilty the investigation the trials over
because it's BS you mean like OJ Simpson case hmm it's exactly what happened they
manipulated evidence and he got off even though he did I want to plow into all
of this but I'm gonna spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems
or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com you are funding
the revolution I mean I cannot say it any clear and so it is essential that
you purchase the products at infowarstore.com I don't want to thank
everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with
colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it you cannot beat that
for children and adults we've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones
that's my dad the colloidal silver and iodine as well infowarslife.com or
AAA2533139 and your purchase of the products stands with us stands with
America stands with Trump stands against the globalists and their satanic
pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
they're coming back against us so we need your support if you are receiving
this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to Alex Jones
when they cut one of our heads off home we just grow two more because you see
the globalists think that we're Satanist like them and that we just want to
dominate only according to our own personal gain but we're connected to
everything it's the gain of everybody for justice in the future and fighting
evil and so we don't mind being demonized or attacked or even sacrificing
ourselves not even from a historic perspective but from a spiritual
perspective knowing it's those decisions that govern who we are well and I
always like to use sports analogies it's like you know a ball hog where okay
maybe you have the best player on the floor but he's a ball hog nobody else
is getting involved you never win a championship so so you want to be on the
winning team that's what this is all about it's not about Alex Jones getting
all the credit because he was right about Anthony Bourdain or all the other
tomorrow's news today it's about we want Americans to be informed so they can
make informed decisions that's really what this comes down to they on the left
and even in the Republicans in historical perspectives but it's changing
out because of Trump they don't want informed voters they don't want you to
know it they enjoy the total control and thinking of us as a bunch of idiots but
we're not idiots that's why they try to keep the info from us and here's the
perfect example because we got we got to go to these clips they don't want people
to know that the DNC and the DCCC have still never turned their servers over
if anyone is guilty of obstruction of justice it's the damn Democrats it's an
open shut case and I love how they changed the subject from her illegal
server that all these countries were accessing she was using as a drop box
like the old spy would put in a trash can or under the bench she just oh my
server added up all his classified info on that another five million goes into
her bank account yeah where made three plus billion dollars I mean Mike yeah
yeah all these foreign governments are putting money in her bank account oh it's
a foundation Russians are hacking while Obama's president not Trump Obama but
that narrative doesn't seem to exist you know see they had to they had to say
Trump's the Russian to open the fake investigation and then cover up their
their their illegal spying and it's all falling down around them and they're all
betting that you're an idiot the first one I want to play as Brian Stelter then
we'll play the three clips that are most important and then Mike Adams is coming
up but this is so incredible Brian Stelter put this out last night saying
you know he he's gonna be meeting soon the next few hours with Putin he is a
liar you can't trust him everything he says is a fraud actually you guys say
everything he says is a lie Trump's only gone sideways on three things he said
vaccines and the situation in Afghanistan and then you could argue he's
been too strong on Russia it's actually incredible how he's crushing them for no
reason but again they're not screwing us over like like the EU is but fine
whatever the point is he's certainly in our interest I mean there's no doubt and
then here's this little anti-American globalist at CNN known to hate flyover
country known to hate this country their own admissions listen to this
projection where everything he's saying is him he's a fraud he's dishonorable
he's just dropping from the New York Times everything he's saying is him and
it's so disingenuous and so wimpy this is just epic here it is Putin and Trump
plan to meet for a private one-on-one conversation before official talks
begin ooh no aides no notetakers so we'll never really know what is said
because that's going back to Malta and going back to presidents always meet
with foreign leaders privately but again he thinks you're dumb he's
stelter you're dumb he doesn't know he thinks you don't know this is standard
continue said because really can we trust either man no we can't in the past the
US president's words have projected power and shaped global decision plus
again Trump is seen all over the world is one of those powerful presidents ever
everyone's at all everything he's doing has been successful so far but again oh
we don't have power anymore we're a joke the economy's coming back all the
positivity people believe in the future but again stelters demoralizing you
like Tokyo rose oh as we're about to invade the Japanese homeland 1945 you've
lost America's been conquered everybody it's like Baghdad Bob this guy's like
Baghdad Bob continue what the president said meant something it meant a lot but
not now not anymore what president Trump says is so frequently false or
nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning the same power the same
impact as past presidents it's a shame back it up 10 seconds the president
doesn't have power his words don't have power anymore we don't have any power
no you don't have any power anymore see it it's all what you are this is
incredible one minute continue just look at that so frequently false or
nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning the same power the same
impact as past presidents but this big failure is defeating you continue it's
a shame but it's true it possible it's a shame but it's true just because you
say a pile of dog crap as chocolate Dutch chocolate ice cream doesn't make
it so you know I mean would you let Brian Stelter babysit your kids just look
at that face let's continue Trump simply cannot be trusted he has proven this
himself time and time again it's his own lies and his own contradictions that
have proven it and that is why this is a profound test for journalists a profound
test will you really attack him more he's up there buggy whipping like he's the
boss ban info wars info wars is a disease take Jones off the air so he can't
respond so I can lie about him and he can't respond to me this is the cult of
this little son of a bitch well it's a perfect that he actually looks and acts
like George Costanza you know Costanza kind of a cheap skate but he's a
lovable guy don't compare George Costanza to this you know what I'm saying
it's the boy for the point is he's a joker he's a con man you can't trust him
but that's the spokesman for lock up your kids man pennywise Stelter but you
know what Alex here's the thing you'll float to you know he's floating alright
here's the thing I would love to wind up and punch Brian Stelter right in the
face but here's the problem he's not even there he's not really there he's an
aberration he's let's be clear we don't wish any harm on him a Democrat shooting
members of Congress and breaking Ron Paul's ribs and calling for violence
we're peaceful no I'm just I'm just saying he's not see that's what it is we
won't know what Trump and Putin doesn't he look like the subway spokesperson
well don't I think he looks more like great comedian get don't compare Jason
Alexander's a great comedian we love George Costanza put him next to pennywise
but but he said it all in the opening he says we're not gonna know what Trump
and Putin say oh my gosh Brian you mean you're gonna be crapping your little
adult diaper because Trump and Putin might be conspiring to make the world
a better place oh no Stelter what will you do he's an aberration he's fake look
it really is Delta lost some weight right there oh my gosh that's actually
Jared from Subway I thought that was Brian Stelter they must be separated and
I want to be clear I'm not saying Brian Stelter's a pedophile I don't think I
just think he looks like I'm just saying he fluts with the rest of them I'm
just saying he scares the hell out of me he's one scary looking big well
anybody who's willing to look he's got the look he's got the look yeah he's got
the look anybody who's willing to go on whoa
that's Hillary Clinton's daughter her beer mr. Ed that is that is Webster Hubble's daughter hello Wilbur
hello Wilbur a horse is a horse of course of course that is of course
unless the horse is a famous mr. Ed so what is it what I mean we have a
lot of these big historic clips we're gonna get to a man and here's the thing
Alex I think that the reason why Brian Stelter is desperately lying like he is
to his audience is because he knows that he's dying he knows CNN is dying he
knows they're an aberration you can't even and the fact that they've got to put
a turd like that in the game I'm saying I'm not calling for bounce I'm just
saying if you swing it Stelter you miss there's nothing there it's like swinging
it seeing it swinging it they're dead it's like slimer from Ghostbusters exactly
they're not actually there they're just an aberration they're just projecting
themselves out there to take you cheese the rat we knew that show would get
cancelled and he's gone bye-bye Chuck E cheese the rat Brian here's the deal

you're listening to the Alex Jones show
there is a tide and the affairs of men when taken at the flood leads on to
fortune that's of course a famous line written off of the documented words of
Julius Caesar all our fortune is freedom and productivity in our time and this
is not a mission impossible it is a mission objective that is a hundred
percent absolutely in our brass but you no matter what color you are what
gender you are where you came from if you believe internet freedom and that
means access to the marketplace of ideas commerce you name it if you're
against the communist Chinese plan of a global social score now being adopted
by Apple and others for total control everything you do in your life well then
this mission is for you if you should choose to accept it Mike Adams is on
fire Paul Watson wrote a six-page boil down report that also links to his
report that's on infowars.com but the 50 plus page report the censorship master
plan decoded is from the enemy's own arrogant statements but no one had
collated this together or produced a battle plan just like Congress doesn't
read the bills if folks read the articles on infowars.com and retweet
them and Facebook them and hand share them and get them to Congress for the
hearings they're having tomorrow this will change the world because no one did
this people said well why don't we have airplanes earlier although we're right
brothers didn't come along why don't we have radio earlier well Marconi didn't
come along this is their own arrogant admissions they think we're stupid they've
bought off the so-called free speech watchdogs ACLU electronic frontier
foundation so we're having to do it and Mike Adams an engineer software
designer that's selling author he knows what's going on he writes all these great
articles I said why don't you put together the whole decode of this of
what's happening and how to strike back against it so that a lot of big news
obviously John Brennan is a total trader of this country converted to a
hobbyism and caught line to Congress since Trump press conference an
impeachable offense treasonous to even meet with the Russians and talk about
working together even though Trump's squeezing Russia incredible that's all
coming up we've got highlights of it the Awan brothers it's all coming out
Hillary server but right now emergency report the censorship master plan
emergency big text plot to kill free speech revealed if you we all know as
libertarians as nationalists as conservatives as natural health
advocates are real anti-war liberals we all know free thinkers organizations
groups the globalists don't like that challenge their system we all know of
all the diverse groups out there that we've been censored we've been blocked
and it's gotten exponentially worse well now they've come out and jump the
shark last week and in big public symposiums admitted we're gonna shut
down info wars and everybody else so it's all there and Mike Adams has
collated it into this report that you can forward that you can send a talk show
host that you can ring the alarm this is it we have their Death Star plans Mike
Adams congratulations on your great work Paul Watson want to thank him as well
and the whole crew here I don't normally hype things up you know we broke the
Bourdain thing as I had sources inside that said he had a Kanye West moment
was saying he wanted to basically kill Harvey Weinstein was going to expose
Bill Clinton as a rapist and now that's come out mainstream news today and I'm
told even more is about to come out including video so people better watch
out but I tell you this is so huge try to encapsulate for people why this is so
important because again no one understands the attack plan it's so
complex people throw their hands up you have in there from their own admissions
diagrammed at all well primarily Alex and thanks for having me on the tech
Giants thought that they could censor and de-platform and shadow ban all of us
and that no one would notice because they do it using covert algorithms and
they're doing it for a purpose that I outline in the report which turned out
to balloon to 59 pages by the way but you know you're free to print it and
share it and post it and Paul Joseph Watson did a really great story covering
it as well but they're doing this because number one they want to create an
internet where there's only one allowable opinion on any given topic and
that that official opinion is determined by radical left-wing ideology which is
always a moving target no one can possibly keep up with it they redefine
it daily and so it's it's basically insanity it's a call for online
insanity echo chambers where no one is allowed to dissent on any top whatsoever
from climate change to politics to gender to finance to history all of these
topics and much more we're looking at a nuclear apocalypse of censorship if we
don't stop this right now and that's why we have to have these legislative and
regulatory actions I've outlined 13 of them in the report that the legislators
and regulators could use as a starting point to brainstorm action to take action
you've either got to indict these CEOs of Facebook for racketeering or you've
got to you gotta reel in the censorship you've got to make them expose their
algorithms for example you have to have appeals methods a due process system in
place for people who have been banned or maybe you write a law that says that
people who have been banned can sue Google and sue YouTube and sue Facebook
for punitive damages as well as actual damages this is a blueprint this this
document destroys the entire justification the hate speech nonsense the
fake news nonsense it destroys it with an academic language approach I don't
know if you've had a chance to read even a few paragraphs it's excellent it's
designed for Congress and the lawyers to show them that they're creating prior
restraint shelling effect a giant reeducation camp online where if you
promote whatever their latest garbage is you get promoted which is a form of
digital payoff digital currency everyone else is shunted and controlled this is
just unprecedented this technotronic takeover it actually it is the
crushing of the human soul and they've lost control of the narrative Alex CNN
is panicked panic because they know that if you were allowed to compete in the
marketplace the free ideas you would crush CNN I mean you're crushing them
anyway in terms of audience but CNN would be obsolete overnight they are
panicked they have to call for destroying you and your network because they
can't compete with your ideas they can't compete with your news reporting staff
and I outline all this in the report fact by fact paragraph by paragraph with
citations with examples irrefutable logic on many levels this is a blueprint
for how we fight back and stop the techno dictatorship that's tried to
destroy our country and listen we don't want to be the only ones doing this it
actually scares us when I talked to Mike last week I said you're an engineer
you're a well-known tech writer you've got hundreds of websites this is
successful as info wars just under the radar I said I don't know how to try to
put this together how little folks need it and I was so upset that they say no
one's done a report no one's collated their own admissions well we've done it
now this is this is quotes and admissions and exhibits of the crimes they've
committed against our republic and our free speech and a public conspiracy
against free will and free association this is the true civil rights human
rights fight of the century I can't believe we're right in the middle of it
Mike yeah and and you know what you look at the writing of Paul Joseph Watson or
even this report I know we're going to break but we know what we're talking
about because we have been attacked we have had to defend ourselves we have had
to build systems to defend against these assaults so we intimately know how the
sense right it's going on forever it's just now it what it's a hundred times
worse exactly we are experts because we have experienced it we do exactly Mike
Adams is on fire every day we're gonna come right back with Mike Adams this is

you're listening to the Alex Jones show the year is 1995 and info wars
launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes in a freak mishap
info wars comm and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit
which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to earth 25 years
later transdimensionally over the space time continuum through full space where
people are extremely lazy the social engineers are there laughing what we
envisioned a hundred years ago 20 years ago is now reality while the society
unravels men run around totally frantic not knowing how to be men and women run
around frantic not only women and they don't understand that it's an
animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed it's fulfilling
to be involved it's fulfilling info wars tomorrow's news today
waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
lines of the info war there's so much entertainment so much news out there but
what you're hearing is the only detailed scientific report from their own
admissions for the plan to in free speech not just here but worldwide now
being executed against anybody who's nationalist or capitalist I had the
2018 election and beyond Mike Adams natural news comm is an engineer an
expert he and Paul Watson both have reports out today Paul has a boil down
report on his report they're at natural news comm info wars comm and I know all
you already know this our listeners like Alex we know there's since for
everybody we don't expand Congress doesn't understand it the president
understands it's going on but doesn't even know his Twitter pushes most of
Twitter users don't even get it sent to him so Facebook said last week look we
already ban Alex Jones from sharing info we kick his page off he ensues just
don't look we already banned them CNN stop New York Times Washington Post
thousands of publications but they're making their big push there's this big
fight Mike Adams want to get back in your report it's on info wars comm the
censorship master plan decoded again I like it to a Star Wars analogy episode
four these are Death Star plans these are valuable see the globalists just
think you're idiots and then just oh that's just no big deal you know you
think it's a little piece of gold foil sitting there on the side of the road
it's a big old gold coin this is critical this is their battle plan this is
how to show what they're doing and then expose them and defeat them it's on
info wars comm right now get it get it tweet it Facebook it share it print off
copies call Congress email it to Congress everyone hammer them that they
got hearings tomorrow legitimizing this Mike what do you think's going on in
the intramural battles of the big corporate dying dinosaur media that's
very jealous of Facebook YouTube and Google because they still get force fed
to everybody but they don't want that's not enough they want us completely banned
because they admit these reports that will other people create subsites they
still share it it goes viral other places they want that desire of
legitimizing the complete ban first in cyberspace and then physically but but
what do you think your smart guys going on in the public debate is it about
legitimizing censorship or or is it just panicking where are they going well
they they are panicked I call them media monopolist and they've come to the
realization that without the artificial algorithmic boosting of their visibility
by Facebook Google and others they would already be obsolete the independent
media is really the decentralization of information and news analysis it's
giving power back to the people decentralization is good for society
centralized news or monopolize news is New York Times Washington Post CNN and
you know they're handed scripts every day of what to say what to report and
what to avoid reporting that model is obsolete the people don't want to be
spoon-fed false narratives every day by different faces spouting the exact same
words over and over again people want a diversity of ideas a diversity of
analysis people understand in fact that there are different points of view in
the world and they'd like to actually eat from that ideological and they're
trying to define different points of view as fake news that's right and then
the platform and you're right they are hanging on and they're absolutely
panicked and remember that the the central assertion of these media
monopolists is that they alone have a unique divine right or a divine ability
to discern reality without bias or distortion and that no one in the
independent media they claim has any such capability and can't even obtain
such a capability in other words they think they are gods or that they are in
touch with actual gods even though they hate religion and they hate Christians
their mythology their dogma is that they are the gods of truth and that anyone
who disagrees with them is by default fake news so that's that's the the dark
corner of the media that we have now crept into and we're exposing it
every day that's what this report is about and that's why info wars not just
survival but thriving and expanding and so crucial to the freedom to think in
our society remember they're they're trying to crush your freedom to think
not just your freedom to share a link or your freedom to express your voice but
your very freedom to think for yourself that is what is under assault because the
media monopolist in order for them to maintain control over society and
influence the outcomes of elections they must be able to inject and insert
thoughts ideas cultural narratives and belief systems into the minds of the
masses Alex and let's bring this up to your in your smart businessman not
just an engineer and all the things you've done the Streisand effect the
arrogance of stelter saying ban info wars Cuomo saying ban info wars them
having conferences they are so crazy that historically you say something's
banned you push it right to the avant-garde and so it's it's why do you
think they've chosen info wars and then let's go into the section how would you
talk about the way to counter this because the chosen that's the most
important part we needed we need Congress to know hey read the report now
here's what you do we have all the cards as President Trump says this is one of
the few areas where he fights with them instead of understanding they've hijacked
utilities they have engaged in classical racketeering they must be I mean to have
CNN calling because when you read the reports out of the New York Times they
want everyone banned all quote conspiracy theories when CNN says the fact
checkers we don't like what they're saying that Hillary you know has bad
health problems or whatever or the Federal Reserve's private they want the
power to ban that that is so draconian they're clearly villains so how are they
risking jumping the shark like this well they specifically target you and I
outlined some of this in the report because your delivery style which is
aggressive which is asking big questions kind of shaking people awake out of a
slumber almost like a people are in almost a hypnotic type of slumber where
they're subjected to this this IV drip info war is the opposite of NPR it's
more like an annoying alarm clock exactly an NPR I'm glad you mentioned that
because it is lulling people to sleep you got to understand that that controlling
people's thoughts and ideas requires a continuous CNN fake news dis info stream
it has to be uninterrupted and you Alex Jones are the interrupter of that toxic
stream of disinformation that CNN is trying to drip into the minds of people
you are the primary interrupter I actually call you that in the report
you're the interrupter of the false paradigm that's being shoved into the
minds of the masses and that is key because they don't go after independent
media outlets that are you know more subdued or more stylistically like the
mainstream media they're going after you because you're the guy who walks into
the room of people being you know lulled to sleep and you know you rip off the
covers and you throw ice on them and you say wake up look what's happening here
welcome to reality that's what you do and you're the best at it and that's why
they're trying to take you down well all I know is you're easy they do want
people hypnotically into a lull be lazy be dumb and I'm running around raising
an alarm bell I'm just like Paul Revere you and they've also censored you
massively as well and it's a real badge of honor that's happened it's not about
shooting horns folks it's about what are they most afraid of that lets you know
what is most effective and the turn is into warriors Alex I mean think about
this we are stronger and more determined and more passionate and even really more
informed today because of all the attacks on us I mean think about how you
and I and Paul Watson attacks totally motivated absolutely they've turned us
into warriors they've given us the spirit of the founding fathers the
revolutionary spirit to take back our nation and our freedom of speech we are
stronger today because of it and that's why we will win stay there my friend
your analysis of the whole Trump-Putin meeting with Owen shroyer coming in and
more on this report listen I never I'm not even plugging by products today
because I'm so obsessed with us then for store.com please support us we got big
sales going or we won't be here the enemy is really trying to take us down
and we're glad because it means we're effective but it's just so critical
realized without you spreading the word or sharing the links we're nothing the
only you can override their censorship and control this 4th of July is special
everybody can see it they can feel it the globalists are attempting to kill a
worldwide awakening to their tyranny and America yet again is at the heart of the
resistance the globalist that's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great
supporters to think about info wars now more than ever and what would the world
be like if info wars wasn't there resisting the globalist what would have
happened if you hadn't supported info wars we would not be having the victories
we have today so yes a lot of good things are happening but the enemy is
tracking back so please think about info wars and funding our operation while
you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic we
have record sales going on right now free shipping on hundreds of different
items more than 20 items are 50% off like brainforce plus x2 40% off knockout
sleep aid 1776 silver bullets 995 little silver and free shipping you can't beat
that this 4th of July special and our sales are special to match it info or
store.com living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it

you're listening to the alex jones show
defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
all right we got a long way to go in a short time to get there but I was
literally during the four-minute break thinking and then I came back and sat
down and Mike Adams the Skype the health ranger started saying the exact
thing thing I was thinking when I was in the bathroom combing my hair and
flossing my teeth because I just had a hamburger and it was like when I was on
the plane years ago flying to the view of New York and one of the heads of one
of the big banks was on board he said alex you don't get it you think people
adapt and overcome tyranny they will submit deterrent and I was gonna come
back and say that and Mike said they don't during the break he goes they
don't think we're fighters they think we're gonna lay down they're just in
control of things because people have handed over responsibility and aren't
conscious and just submit and that's exactly what I was about to say when you
understand that fighting back and being involved is animating and makes you
stronger and it's the only hope you've got plus you always have victory if you
take action not at first but down the road because it creates these wavelengths
these ripples in the pond culturally spiritually economically that are
unstoppable with the whole human momentum of our ancestors that were such
winners they've just diverted off a softness of a loser area we're winners
we're an incredible species with unlimited potential and if you get
animated and get upset and then take action with the information you're
unstoppable say Mike said they turn us into warriors I don't sit here when I
get attacked or get blocked or whatever and go oh my god poor me but see the
globalists they all sell out to power for whatever is easiest they're a
collection of weenies and sellouts and weaklings but we as trailblazers rugged
individuals only get stronger in the animating contest of liberty Mike well
think about it if you if your parents and you have two kids and one kid you
just give them everything bonus points they don't have to earn anything there's
no merit to their behavior they get everything but then the other kid you
have you make them earn everything which kid is going to be stronger and the same
thing is happening in media we in the independent media we have to not just
earn everything that we're getting we have to work twice as hard three times
as hard as the media Monopolis because we are being artificially penalized so
we have become in essence just from a pragmatic point of view the modern the
modern Spartans maybe right right I mean guerrilla information marketing you
know things like that I mean we we know how to get the word out and we don't
depend on these mainstream systems because those systems have been
penalizing us for so long we've had to find workarounds now if they would stop
censoring us we would be a hundred times bigger you know almost immediately
because there is an effect and by the way I know your numbers I don't mind
that's actually true I know I know it is true you know millions of followers I
have on Facebook you have you know tens of millions across they won't even let
you hit any of them that's exactly right you built them you go there you
advertise with your huge platform and built it and then they steal it and then
won't even let you have access to it but then let the left be force-fed I want to
get to some of these clips oh and you want to comment well yeah I just to talk
about real quick what you're saying about the animating contest of liberty
just to kind of give a physical representation or manifestation of that
imagine a land whatever you choose all historically just a bunch of slaves
working in the fields or on the pyramids or whatever you want to say and
they all know their slaves no press but they just kind of do it that's all they
know and even though they think they need to rebel they don't see it so they
just kind of go along but then as soon as they see one person attacking the
slave master two people three or four people boom all of a sudden everyone's
attacking and it's like bam kicking the gear fight take them down get your
freedom back that's the engagement that's the clicking that's what you're
doing and think about it most your mainline conservatives and people know
their censorship so they all pay their pound of flesh and attack me or say
whatever and then get promoted and go oh look I got promoted but you're
promoting crap it's empty so you just parroted what they wanted that wasn't
you you just lost your soul one person we reach through their barricade of lies
is worth more than a million zombies we're not trying to win in their paradigm just
like China has a social scoring system there is a de facto system in place in
America today where if you if you attack Alex Jones you're gonna get moved up in
the media but if you go along with anything that info wars says then
you're going to be penalized it's not it's not an official scoring system but
it's an unofficial covert scoring system and it is in place and it is modeled
after China and that's the most key things been said today you get into
how they're outsourcing in your report on page 46 the censorship foreign
countries the Chinese government just banned I mean I know your wife's
Taiwanese the emoji of Taiwan for all Apple users globally was banned and it
would crash your phone if you used it I mean the level of control is
unbelievable yes and they claim they have no responsibility because they're
outsourcing the censorship to these radical left-wing groups like at the
SPLC which has been widely so where are the civil rights lawsuits where are the
racketeering suits where are the Human Rights Commission meetings where are the
censorship hearings where are the monopoly hearings this is cut and dry
Tim Cook and Apple don't just have slave factories now they officially moved
five months ago to China and now let them control in America what emoji you
can send my god America what are you gonna put up with next and if if this
censorship had been targeting leftists the ACLU would be screaming bloody
murder right now the EFF would be all over it there would be protests
nationwide there will be mobs of people protesting the Facebook buildings and
camp I and headquarters all across the country if leftists were being censored
but because it's conservatives being censored the left is perfectly okay
with it because what they want an authoritarian society where they
control the only allowable opinion that can be spoken or shared in any online
forum that is an Orwellian authoritarian tyrannical dictatorship and that's
what they want so they can open the borders without dissent so they can
take your guns without anybody being able to complain online or share a
complaint so they can get rid of Trump and bring in whoever they want without
anyone being able to and that you know even more Mike Adams is everything he
said I keep saying that's the most important that's the most important
until he trumps or something more important they're launching the super
risky mass censorship program that was in beta to now maximum you know 90 plus
percent of conservatives being banned it was 80% last week because they're
getting ready to make their move civil war they already call the civil war I
go hey look they say we're in a civil war oh Jones playing for the civil war
they're the one saying it Rob Reiner Bill Maher Michael Moore I want to play
some of these clips but again they think their audience is so dumb they go we're
in a civil war time to start overthrowing I go well look they say we're in a civil
war Jones is crazy ban him he says they're a civil war well the civil war
is already begun in the online realm and it's the left and now Uber has a list of
conservatives that won't give you rides just like China won't let you fly if you
have a bad social score remember the first chapter of every kinetic war is
the info war as as you well know that's the name of your operation the
information war is happening online it is the opening chapter of the civil war
and they want to take it kinetic this is like enemy armies this is like enemy
armies building up on your border that's right I mean they're here it's on
Owen well and again what do they do to the slave that steps out and shows the
rest of the slaves hey you don't have to be a slave stand up for yourself what
do they do that they flogging exactly that's what they're doing to you Alex
that's what they're doing info wars we're the ones awakening the mind slaves
I'm sorry it's true and I'm glad to do it I'm not bitching I'm not a victim but
they got us strapped up with cat or nine tails then I don't care they don't
care what they do they've they've they've attacked Mike and we're not bitching
we're saying we are over the target we are bombers are getting the main flag we
are dropping bombs on the enemy if you want to be part of the war join us
spread the links get involved by our products call Congress in this report to
everyone we are fighting for the country this is the 21st century war this is not
a drill it's not a game it's not a joke behind the scenes they've got
intelligence ops they've got PIs they've got stuff folks if I told you you
wouldn't believe it but I'm not gonna give them the time of day talking about
it it has been for four years total war and the last year it's intensified
massively and I'm not complaining I asked for this but I'm just telling you
this is total war this isn't entertainment this isn't Netflix Mike
Adams they've driven us they've driven us Alex to the point where in terms of
online presence we have nothing left to lose think about that it's not like we
want to appease Google or appease Facebook they practically censored us to
the point of oblivion anyway with with down raking algorithms you know
punishment a shadow banning all these things we have nothing left to lose in
the online world you either stand up and fight or you become completely obsolete
and a lot of folks they think our listeners will go well I better not
promote natural news or info or says I'll get restricted or ban you're gonna
lose it all anyways again let's exactly on the internet we're as big as ever
with real fans real people we're just telling you now they want us totally
banned not just on big platforms but they're physically suing us they're
trying to sabotage us they're trying to infiltrate us we've got Hillary's law
firms contacting anybody that ever worked here offering the money to lie
about us this is total war people a lot of folks go well you're dumb to fight
them no you're dumb to roll over you're not Americans I'm talking to the
minority of folks that listen if you don't understand how critical this is
shame on you and really got to ask people did you want to wake up in a
society where you can't even share a link or utter a sentence online unless you
first check to see is that the officially allowed sentence for today and
is it different from yesterday's opinion and then you're alerted for being a
parent that's right that's right because they want the internet to be an
authoritarian echo chamber of bad ideas liberal ideas are bad ideas they don't
work and that's why we must defeat them we'll be back in two minutes I got to
get these clips there's so many epic clips we got like seven or eight of them
and Mark dice he had himself a week ago talk about internet censorship that's
what he wanted to come on about it of course we're right here in the middle of
it Mike Adams is our guest info wars.com get his report get it out or sorrows

at infowarslife.com you're listening to the alex jones show
we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of
the resistance well here's putans as the cold war is over we carefully
analyze the current status the present and the future of the Russia the United
States relationship key issues of the global agenda it's quite clear to
everyone that the bilateral relationship are going through a
complicated stage and yet those impediments the current tension the tense
atmosphere essentially have no solid reason behind it the cold war is a
thing of past the era of acute ideological confrontation of the two
countries the thing of a remote past is a very vestige of the past the era of
human expansion and renaissance is here if we can defeat the globalist Mike
Adams your take on that powerful club well part of the reason the globalist
need to dominate the media is because they can't allow humanity to explore the
innovation the entrepreneurship and the individual creativity that leads to
abundance and prosperity prosperity makes the globalist obsolete that's
really the bottom line to all of this I know you've covered this in various ways
many times but setting humanity free the greatest fear of the globalist and
controlling the media narrative is the mental enslavement system by which they
keep people controlled and keep and keep people down and so this is why
ultimately this translates into the attacks on you and me and others because
we literally I mean we want a free humanity we want a free humanity on
medicine and technology science economic abundance spiritual awakening all of
these issues we love humanity CNN hates America CNN hates civilization if you
think about it they want to keep it down that's my take hey guys what's one of
the amen to that which one of these clips is the Juan brothers clip let's go
ahead and play that it's a longer clip we don't let's just get into that now
because you've got to go and mark dice is coming up a Juan brothers being brought
up the fact that the Soros has been uploading our elections not Russia
Trump going hey who cares who hacked the server there's no proof Russia did it
what about the crimes Hillary committed with the server and all this oh and
Mike and then Putin mentions Bill Browder and and the potential crimes he's
committed to Bill Browder's been going on mainstream media for the last seven
days trying to build up his own little fake faux personality that that's gonna
be totally destroyed so they're all out I mean they're all in right now to try to
save what they've created and just to echo what what Mike said earlier you
know and what it comes down to is individual independence the average
human has been so beaten down by the media so beaten down by the chemicals
they ingest they don't even know how to empower themselves and the individual
human being is capable of everything that's what they don't want you to and
that's key I mean you watch CNN it's total demoralization Mike let me ask
that last question because you they are desperate you're right let's not be too
confident here though they are now going to pull out all the stops I think
terror attacks false flags to make themselves the victims gut level Mike
Adams what do you think they're gonna do well you're right they are gonna pull
out all the stops but we should also I think think about the Berlin wall as a
historical metaphor the wall fell suddenly and unexpectedly and the media
monopolist today are like a Berlin wall around your mind but that wall can be
shattered in in an instant when we wake up and decide to take back our freedom
and our human dignity which is what independent media is all about so really
I can imagine a world where suddenly the entire media monopoly regime collapses
that can happen but we're gonna have to push and press the fight we're gonna
have to take action and not just sit on your couch being spoon-fed false ideas
from MSNBC you're gonna have to take action you're gonna have to get with the
program yeah and I want to be clear I think it's already collapsed this is
their counter-strike time to convince us we're not free and that we're about to
go to break but I think that's the moment we've gotten to we've already blown
giant holes in this wall Owen yeah like Brian Stelter goes on CNN and tries to
act like the authority of reality and news that Trump is a liar Trump is done
nothing good they they want you to feel like a second-class citizen they want
you to feel like someone has to tell you what to do no you're a sovereign
citizen remember Como saying I can read WikiLeaks you can't oh no Cuomo no we're
all independent sovereign citizens here Mike Adams great job with your report on
censorship everybody get it out that's your mission folks all right thank you
Alex good to join you thank you amazing job God bless you get the report the
censorship master plan natural news dot-com
living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it a lot
of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people and that
is a really really an awful situation we are not the enemy of the American
people we love the American people
but we are not the enemy of the American people we love the American people we
love the American people we love the American people we are not the enemy of
the American people we love you know it's something the dying corporate media
does now in the thousands of articles a week that I can't even keep track of
hundreds of day that I try to scan over they go Jones is an internet talk show
host with over five billion views on YouTube and that was years ago when
YouTube told me I had that many views not just the billions on our own channel
but no we're on over 200 radio affiliates over 400 TV stations over 80
cable stations now some huge some small they're all very special you're watching
please spread the word that's how we get around the sensors but isn't it
something better if I was internet like Mark Dice with his media relations
degree his best-selling books with over a billion views on YouTube all by
himself I mean we always heard like the rugged individualist the prospector went
out to Alaska for 10 years and he found the big mother load and you know became
a billionaire I mean is it what isn't it cool that like nobody really helped
Mark Dice or me and then meanwhile the president's son Donald Trump Jr. came out
last week retweeting Paul Watson's article and what Mark Dice had said
that seeing in the kings of fake news say I'm fake news and then every time they
misrepresent what I said they go he needs to be banned he says Anthony
Bourdain was killed no I said he said Bill Clinton was a rapist and that Harvey
Weinstein should die and that his wife was raped by Weinstein or his fiance and
that he she was also abused and in Illuminati rituals and he was gonna go
public that came out then in the in the Daily Mail today I told you a month ago
because I talked to not one but two people that were at different shoots
where he was flipping out about Kanye West and everything and finally became
pro-Trump the interview out now is from a month before that when he was saying
well I'm neutral on Trump but I don't like Democrats and it goes through all
of it now how did I just make that up and then but no I have real sources one of
which can't even come on air now because of what they told me and I'm not at
liberty to tell you I've asked them to tell you what happened with law
enforcement when they came on but I'm just pointing out to you this is a war
this is not a game it's not a joke when Mark Dice doesn't play games they
censor him from 10 million views of video to a half million views of video
when we do that's the same thing and now they admit it last week in this big push
to ban info wars and then Facebook goes hey don't worry we they're already
basically banned conservatives are libertarians are Christians don't totally
ban them they'll have lawsuits show mark I was trying to get him on for a couple
weeks he's a busy guy he finally said last like Monday I'll come on next Monday
before this whole controversy happened he wanted to come on to talk about the
censorship he's tracking and what's unfolding so he's with us for the
balance of the hour mark dice.com remember that we used to have our own
websites you need to go back to info wars back to mark dice.com because more
more info wars has its own streams its own posts and back during Parkland they
said that I said nobody died they removed our videos froze our channel I
uploaded them I didn't say that I said there was a stand down people reported
that the police stood down they said that it was something else about 14
million views because people wanted to know what was really going on but see
once they're done kicking us off YouTube Facebook Twitter they're gonna get our
own websites so this is the big fight mark dice couldn't be a better time for
you to come on right in the zeitgeist here my friend I've laid a lot of stuff
out here but whoa where would you historically say we are right now we're
pushing against the possible Orwellian nightmare scenario where people in
their websites their businesses disappeared down the memory hole and for
over a decade the mainstream media has been downplaying the social media
aspect of businesses social media stars youtubers you're an internet radio host
I'm just a youtuber but now today Facebook is launching their own exclusive CNN
and other mainstream media shows not streaming the CNN and cable news and
other outlets on Facebook Anderson Cooper today is launching his own Facebook
exclusive show called Anderson Cooper full circle where he's gonna be answering
questions from the Facebook audience so they have embraced social media because
they were late to the game they didn't innovate they had their establishment
system set up they had their cable channels they had their FCC licenses
their printing presses their magazines distributed at all the grocery stores the
bookstores and then we came along and using this basic and what's now basic
technology which at the time 12 years ago is cutting edge we built huge
audiences that completely dominate them my youtube channel has more subscribers
than MSNBC's channel than CBS news than MTV news than NBC news I mean CNN's
YouTube channels pretty much the only one out of the big mainstream media
channels that's bigger than mine and I'm one guy on a laptop in my kitchen or
now in my in my family room and they're so scared because we've dominated them
we've snuck up behind them they were asleep at the wheel and so now they're
suppressing us they're teaming up with the very infrastructure that we've been
using and are getting paid to do it 90 million dollars Facebook is paying CNN and
all these other unbelievable so so they're ending the you and YouTube they're
ending your face in Facebook they are going to this this model and they want
to use info wars as a case point they admit they're so arrogant once we are
accepted to be banned trying to get conservatives to go along with that then
everybody else and so how do we organize to fight this mark guys because this is
clearly they got caught flat-footed in 2016 they're not getting caught flat-footed
now the president needs to act the White House needs to take action we need
more people to get involved we need to do things the old-fashioned way like you
were mentioning we need to go to websites we need to bookmark websites on the
browsers we can't rely on just scrolling through a social media feed and expect
to see the articles and the pages and the people that we're following to
actually show up we've been seeing this continuing to expand over the last 10
years and now it's so obvious that they're literally admitting it we've
we've suspected a lot of these things were happening we've noticed that some
weird things were happening with our subscribers with our views and with our
videos and posts sort of disappearing and the views is stalling out tremendous
growth over years all of a sudden vanishing and reversing people don't
say that they're not getting the notification so they've been tweaking
the system and they're going to continue to tweak it we need more people to get
involved we need to keep sending out old-fashioned emails texting videos
bookmarking the websites and they're not only trying to censor our message but
they're also trying to cripple us financially so that people can't do
this full time and they also misrepresent what we've said and what we do
while not letting us respond to what's happening so understand folks you see a
Mark Dice video a Paul Watson video an Alex Jones video whichever one you think
is most important hand share it tell people it's forbidden it's verboten
send it out on your own email sign up for own newsletters this is a war don't
think this because Trump got in we're going to win this they are making their
move and what's crazy is mark most members of Congress and folks aren't
even aware of this I've sent the report to the president he's now gotten it I'm
talking to folks as we were just speaking they're all asking you know
what what should we do I say it's in the report so imagine just like we
innovated internet and and and dominated by with more subscribers and CNN you
would more than other big channels think about how panicked they are so so again
we are we don't think of ourselves as big shots what I'm saying is we're the
trailblazers man we are we have to we have to act like that we saw this new
technology emerge started using it started dominating it they were asleep at
the wheel and now they're regretfully trying to stomp us now because we've
won Wimbledon 15 times in a row they're just saying Mark Dyson Alex Jones and
all you other guys you're not allowed on the field we're like but we're the
winners we we played by the rules they go no Anderson Cooper the little you know
billionaire heir son you know one of the oldest Robert Baron families he is God
we will force feed him to everyone now you may recall much of the audience I
think there's probably part of pop culture now the YouTube adpocalypse
that happened last April when all of a sudden the mass demonetization hit they
rolled out their new demonetization features to scroll through the audio
transcripts looking for keywords and videos that people say and then demonetize
them so then one year later in April of this year CNN did their own expose a just
like the Wall Street there we'll talk about the next strike on freedom now

toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in the USA it's filled
with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
the body and it supports the info war it is a classical 360 win this is the
formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can
possibly get you want to yourself you want to your family and you owe it to the
future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
and as focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of America to
reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as
you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together we're changing the
world now it's time to change our bodies with z-shield and four's life.com
you're listening to the Alex Jones show
you got it waging war on corruption
it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
look I played a disgusting Bryant's culture clip earlier I'm gonna play it
get Mark Dice's tape on it. It's one minute long. Him saying, I control reality. I'm God.
I say Trump can't be trusted. I say you're a Russian agent if you meet with Putin.
I say Trump should be able to meet alone with the Russian president, which all presidents have done.
Again, and it's just a little pathetic nobody doing it. But
just as he got to the break, we'll play it in a minute. They launched their new attack in April
this year and CNN said ban info wars, ban everybody else. And now they're in the news.
I think they've miscalculated Mark to brazenly demand we be completely de-platformed shows what
incredible authoritarians they are. Or have they been slowly censoring everybody so long?
Everybody just kind of hears, okay, censorship of conservatives. Yeah, we know, but
we're conservatives. We'll take it. No, we're being robbed. We're being attacked. This is
how they intend to take over. Mark, what do you think? They've lost half their audience permanently
for generations. Nobody's going to ever trust CNN, MSNBC, most of these mainstream media outlets.
So every time that they try to censor us or call for censorship, all that's doing is proving our
point of why we don't watch them. Half of the country has permanently abandoned watching those
platforms. So all they're doing is speaking to the choir. They're singing to the choir. It's an
echo chamber. And CNN, many of us remember, used to actually cover some news. They used to focus
on a few stories for weeks on end to draw out the dramatic effect or some celebrity murder or
some interesting event or a natural disaster. Now it's all Trump bashing 24-7. So even people who,
you know, used to watch CNN, who aren't even really conservatives or into alternative media,
are tuning out and coming into outlets like us, which is why we've been dominating,
which is why they're also trying to not only just censor us but cripple financially. CNN
in April literally targeted YouTube and said that their funding, the advertisers are still playing
ads on offensive content and racist content and all this. They're CNN's literally trying to
financially cripple YouTubers. I was stunned when I saw them literally, this is a second time now,
that they've just overtly tried to shut down infowars. One, when you had a strike on your channel
and it's, okay, well, two strikes away from being shut down. That's not a news story. I mean,
maybe if you were, you know, shut down or the one strike away, that's-
But it was CNN filed the fake complaints saying, I said no one died at Parkland. So
they admitted they were the ones complaining. And now they're literally admitting that they're the
ones that are pressuring Facebook to ban you. I mean, to have one news organization, which is
probably the most accurate, inaccurate fake news outlets, CNN claiming that another news
outlet should be shut down is preposterous. And so, again, today, Facebook started their $90
million campaign to stream not just cable news shows on Facebook, original series,
and they're including Fox News in the lineup so that they can pretend to be like, well,
it's not just a bunch of liberal news, it's, we got a Fox News show. Well, guess which Fox News
show it is? It's Shepard Smith, the biggest never Trump nitwit on that network.
So their answer is force feed us more of their crap, censor whatever's really popular,
and they've all got these weird, you know what, eating grins. They're so delusional.
Well, they're making $15,000 a day. I mean, just imagine, they're making in a week what,
you know, more than an average America makes all year to sit in the studio and talk for an hour
a day with a couple hours of prep. I mean, Anderson Cooper literally makes 15 to 20 grand
every single show. And so he pretends to connect with the average American, which is absurd. These
people are actors. And they're trying to shut down, of course, any alternative emerging social
media networks you've had Andrew Torba on founder and CEO of gab, which is been prevented from having
their app in the app store. And meanwhile, they're censoring gab from having an app in the app store
saying that it's offensive content on the platform. Meanwhile, in the Apple app store right now,
and this has been the case for well over a year, there are slap Donald Trump video games. So there
are literally games in the app store for Apple that encourage violence against the price. So
there's total censorship, total draconian control. They're arrogant monsters. Congress needs to act.
The problem is they're not informed. That's why Mike Adams and I and others put together this
report with Paul Watson. That's on info wars.com that we need to get to Congress and have them
take action for antitrust, civil rights violations, racketeering, you name it.
Thankfully, we have Donald Trump Jr. on our team who is, you know, a generation X or is
familiar with the power of social media. And so he has the ear, obviously, of his dad. And so he
can get some information to him, because YouTube was sort of left on the sideburner forgotten
about in this whole fake war against fake news. It was Facebook and Twitter and the Russian bots
on Twitter. And now they've set their sights on YouTube. The New York Times said that YouTube
is the new talk radio for the far right. And so it must be shut down. It's how brazen they are.
Let's play this Brian Stelter clip. You may have seen it hours before Trump met with Putin.
This is the dribble where he sits there and says, I control reality like Como saying,
you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks. Only I am the arrogance of these people is only
matched by their low ratings. Here it is. Putin and Trump plan to meet for a private
one-on-one conversation before official talks begin. No aides, no notetakers. So we'll never
really know what is said. Because really, can we trust either man? No, we can't. In the past,
the US president's words had projected power and shaped global decisions. What the president said
meant something, it meant a lot. But not now, not anymore. What President Trump says is so
frequently false or nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning, the same power,
the same impact as past presidents. It's a shame, but it's true. Trump simply cannot be trusted.
He has proven this himself time and time again. It's his own lies and his own contradictions
that have proven it. And that is why this is a profound test for journalists.
It's a shame, but it's true from one of the biggest liars on the planet.
It's just profound the projection, Mark Dice.
It sounded like Brian Stelter's inhaling helium before that segment. And everything that they
say is projection. Everything that they accuse others of their guilty of. Brian Stelter recently
was at a forum for journalists at the Aspen Institute to think tank. And he was asked a question
by one of the audience members who said, I'm old enough to remember when CNN actually covered news.
Now it's all Trump 24 seven. And he said, well, we're in an emergency. This is an emergency. The
president Trump is in the White House. So I guess it's an emergency that the black unemployment
set an all time low, but the economy is booming that the streets are getting safer.
It's it's an emergency to the globalist because he's the biggest obstacle to their plan to destroy
the United States, which is why for the last year and a half now they've just been going overboard
and completely freaking out. Oh, one thing I want to mention about the censorship on YouTube.
It's so funny. They're burying so much content that if you search for my number one most viewed
video, which has about 9 million views, President Trump's or Donald Trump's funniest insults and
comebacks, it would or used to be the number one search result. But now it's literally buried
under 50 other videos. And all of the videos on top of it are all mainstream news sources,
because now they've realized that YouTube is a search engine as opposed in conjunction with
a distribution. That's right. Stay there though. Let's explain that because you should even our
own fees will be our videos. Now it's not Sasha Barrett Cohen engaged in fraud is on the front
couple hundred thousand views in our videos that millions are on the front page. Again,
total fraud, total control that we have the truth. Want revenge on the common housefly?

they can feel it. The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny,
and America yet again is at the heart of the resistance, the globalist. That's why this
4th of July, I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about info wars now more than ever,
and what would the world be like if info wars wasn't there resisting the globalist?
What would have happened if you hadn't supported info wars? We would not be having the victories
we have today, so yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back,
so please, think about info wars and funding our operation while you get great products at the
same time on the 4th of July that's so historic. We have record sales going on right now,
free shipping on hundreds of different items, more than 20 items are 50% off like Brainforce Plus,
X2 is 40% off, knockout sleep aid 1776, Silver Bullets 9.95 colletal silver,
and free shipping, you can't beat that. This 4th of July is special, and our sales are special
to match it, infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
The year is 1995, and info wars launches the last of America's counter globalist probes.
In a freak mishap, info wars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit
which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to earth 25 years later.
Transdimensionally, over the space time continuum, where people are extremely lazy,
the social engineers are there laughing. What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago,
is now real. While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men,
and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an
animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved,
it's fulfilling info wars, tomorrow's news today. All right, I've done two and a half hours live
broadcasts that have not plugged yet, and quite frankly, it's just because I'm so focused on the
news, but that's how we finance things. I want to thank you all that buy products
at infowarstore.com. You see mainstream media obsessed with it. They want to shut down
them. Supplements, books, videos, great t-shirts, you name it. We've got Vox Day has come out with
the only libertarian conservative comic books out there. They've already gone to number one
on Amazon. We got a couple thousand of these in. They're $5 apiece. Want to be politically incorrect
buy these, give them to your 10th grade students or 6th grade students, whatever, or donate them
to the library, alt hero, crackdown, volume one, talking about how they're shutting down the free
speech. It's available at infowarstore.com. So get the nice color comic book. It's a revolutionary
act to go into these areas. You see Christian films now dominating Hollywood. This, what's
happening, we're getting on the playing field. Also, I'm not going to spend time on it because
it's so complex and so cool that I don't want to take the time up from Mark Dice, but we have
super silver wound gel now available that has the strongest silver you can get without a prescription.
Remember talking about how great silver was when the other antibiotics and things aren't working
20 years ago in the media saying, oh, that's a conspiracy theory. Now you go to the Walgreens
and they're selling it or you get a prescription for, you know, a hundred bucks and the hospitals
are using it, you know, spray bottles everywhere. But super silver wound gel use silver salt technology
that's an advanced patented technology that has forever changed the colloidal nano silver market.
This has been extensive research on silver salt technology. This research includes 20 plus safety
reports and test series, as well as a first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity
study done on any silver product, but it's for topical use. The formula is 24 ppm, 32 ppm version
is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device. But what you can sell over the counter, this is
an over the counter product, which had to be clear to the FDA is 24 ppm. Similar products
sell for $40 or more. It's $29.95. It is one of the only OTC products with, you can make direct
claims against MRSA, VRE, and many other deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn. Super silver wound gel is
essentially armor for your wounds. This protective barrier that guards the wounds and helps keep
them from getting infected. The barrier of protection can last up to three days
on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection. It is perfect for athletes,
particularly of all ages in all sports areas. That's how it originally got developed. It's
sold under a brand name for $40. And I'm going to just leave it at that, but they're patrons who
let us private label it. We're selling for $29.95. It costs us a lot to secure it because it said
to get FDA approval. So can you imagine how much it costs to get this FDA cleared? Even though
it's been approved by the FDA for over the counter sale, we can't even say we say cleared. That's
what a police state this country is. This is cleared by the FDA, but this is the strongest
over the counter silver in existence. Super silver in fours, life.com in four store.com
or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. We got another big, huge defeat,
the Democrat censorship sale. One of the biggest ever running. I haven't even plugged it yet.
I'm going to leave it at that. Mark dice going back to you.
This is the dastardliness of mainstream media being arrogant while you had a billion views
and I had five billion views and you had all these best selling books and they would all just laugh
at us when we would do a video and, you know, get a million views during the, and then, and then
Anderson Cooper do one and had 5,000 on their channel. So now Facebook 90 million investment
to act like CNN's this God to buy the content. It's like buying dog turds to then force feed it
to everybody. It just shows what a joke it is. And even if they try to censor and ban everybody,
I don't see people going back on the plantation. I don't think Humpty Dumpty can be put back together
again. What do you think? No, they've completely ruined their brand name recognition, which is why
now we're seeing newer media companies like Vox, which actually owns a whole dozen or so
of media companies to then try to fill the internet with all these various different brands.
Oh, it's Axios news. It's the verge. It's Vox media, all these new brands so that people sort of
think that it's a newer emerging company when really it's part of the same umbrella. It's
going to be interesting to see if CNN or if Facebook shows the view count of their new
shows on their watch pages because what if only 50,000 people, 100,000 people are watching these
shows. MTV News can put out a video of an interview with a major celebrity on their YouTube channel
and it barely gets a thousand views. Nobody cares. And the power of the individual
and the individual YouTuber, the individual Facebook user, so important because Mitt Romney,
they say lost, potentially lost. I mean, let's just say there was no voter fraud manipulation.
It feels a fair system. Many analysts credit Mitt Romney with losing the 2012 election because
of that YouTube video of him at an event, at a fundraiser where he was talking trash about
the 47% of Americans who are never going to vote for him. He was at a fundraiser,
the bartender propped up his cell phone on the table, took a video of it, just posted it on
YouTube and it organically spread. And that upset so many people that they literally,
the analysts, Republican analysts credit that as diminishing his credibility beyond repair.
So that's the power of one individual with a cell phone posting on YouTube and now obviously
Twitter and Facebook and Instagram all have these video. And so we now know their answer
is to govern everybody back. That's their answer. But people see, people know Axios
is a clone of Politico. So as fast as they get discredited, they create new bodies.
I think they're admitting defeat here, Mark.
I don't know how they're gonna hold on. They're gonna get more and more desperate
as the midterms approach. And then as the 2020 election approaches, I think they're gonna just
keep on stumbling over their own, what they're hoping are gonna be stepping stones. Because
the Trump train is so engaged that we didn't just relax after the election. We didn't fall asleep
at the wheel and think we'll vote again in four years. This movement is so energized that we're
constantly watching. And even if you and I have pretty big audiences, pretty big channels, but
everybody who has a small YouTube channel of 1000 subscribers. All of it together. And that's
the key. Our listeners, our viewers, no matter who you are, it's like whack-a-mole. I see female,
black, you name it, YouTubers that are just as smart as you and I, emerging Facebookers with
millions of views because they haven't censored them yet. Then they censor them. They start a
new channel. It's big. Then they censor them, but it doesn't matter. People now get it so they know
to follow whatever they're not allowed to have. So again, how do the globalists get around this
dry hand effect? I don't know. I don't think that they know how. I think that they're in uncharted
territory. They're just throwing a bunch of stuff against the wall hoping that it sticks,
which is why we have to counter them on every move. I know some other YouTubers, if they get a
video demonetized or a strike, they're afraid to kind of call YouTube out. They don't want to
make any waves. Every time they do it to me, I just call them out. I make another video pointing
it out. I'll start tweeting to the YouTube CEO, to Susan Wojcicki, who says that just
interrupting her is a sexual microaggression. So we have to just continue to counter every move
that they make because they're so desperate. They've been failing. We're winning and we just have
to keep it up. I don't think we're in uncharted territory. I don't know what's going to happen.
I don't think they know what's going to happen. No, I agree. But we'll come back to the final
segment, but with maximum effort, here's the good news. We don't just have Trump in our awakening
here. All over the world, nationalism, capitalism is the hottest thing, especially with Generation
Z. I'm telling you, the worm is turning to the exciting time to be alive, but the enemy
counter strikes straight ahead. MarkDice.com. Remember websites? Got to go there if you want
to find what he's doing uncensored. MarkDice.com. Save it, just like NewsWars.com. We'll be back.

You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
I don't make Tokyo Rose-type announcements or Baghdad bobbin announcements like,
loveless you've been defeated, come out with your hands up. But here's the deal,
they thought they'd use the web to dumb us down to force feed their garbage. They were arrogant.
Now they're going to try to block innovation. They're going to try to block free ideas. It's
not going to work. They can try to pick InfoWars as a lead pony to take out as a precedent. It's
important to fight for that, but they're going to lose in the end. And I was thinking about,
I forget to put the tweet out. I'd have been Donald Trump Jr. a few months ago when it came out
that CNN, we already knew this, but I guess it's a proverbial evergreen story, has to pay in bars
and pay in hotels and pay at bus terminals and train stations and airports to have their crap force
fit. And it's in all the high schools in the country. They pay for the TVs and the cable in
the school. When they've got to pay to make you watch it and listen to it, what does that tell
you? The question was, how much would you have to be paid to watch CNN? I mean, a year ago that
they were less popular than reruns of Yogi Bear. Now they're a shadow of that. So of course,
they're, we are the authority. We are the only ones that can read WikiLeaks. Shut down Trump.
Trump is a liar. InfoWars is a liar. But I'm actually surprised we still have massive traffic
at InfoWars and our core audience is great. But this isn't a bigger deal that they're all over
the news saying, oh, don't worry, we've already shadow banned conservatives and we're already
blocking push notifications of Trump's tweets. That's antitrust violations. So Mark, separate
from what we do on air, talking about this, we need to get Congress, we need to get the president,
we need everyone informed because this attempted takeover of the internet is outrageous.
It just shows how arrogant they are. So how do you see all this unfolding?
Yeah, we need to talk to our congressman, congressperson, and get them to be educated about
these issues because we saw during the Mark Zuckerberg hearing several hours, there were
literally only about three decent questions. Ted Cruz asked, you know, Ted Cruz obviously knows
what's going on, but there were three decent questions asked of Mark Zuckerberg. These congressmen
don't know the power of this. They don't know about the algorithms and the push notifications and
the censorship. And of course, there's no transparency from Facebook. They don't tell you
which pages have been censored. They don't show you, oh, well, you violated our policies.
There's no transparency. There's no option to appeal. It's they say what they want to do
and they do it. There's no way around it. And Facebook responded to the CNN reporter when he
called for your complete censorship. And they said, well, we're not going to remove info wars.
But, you know, we've, we've censored them by 80 percent that we, we censor and punish
restrict pages, but they don't show which posts, which pages show me where on a page you can go
and say, yeah, you have a strike. We're throttling you because give me the reason why. And if that's
the case, why is CNN allowed to have a platform? I don't think there's been a news outlet that's
been more incorrect about more issues than CNN. So why is it that they're even allowed on there?
And of course they should be allowed. I'm not for censorship. No, I agree. But how are they the
policemen that decides it's like having Hitler shed over the Nuremberg trials? Because they're
all friends of the Sun Valley conference just happened in Idaho, which is an annual Builderberg
of tech media. So Mark Zuckerberg, Tim, Tim Cook, all these heads of all the media and social media
companies were there, this small little resort town they meet every year to talk about the new
policies, the new censorship. So this, we're obviously not in the good old boy club, whereas you
have the executives, Jeff Zucker from CNN's over there, all these guys. So they're sitting around
in a room having lunch talking about what they're going to do and who's not going to get censored.
So that's why we're just not part of the club, as George Carlin said. And even Google is censoring
their own Google custom news feed. You may have seen a few months ago, you used to be able to
filter your Google news feed to custom search results. But now they just show you what's
recommended for you. And I guess you can go to your favorites page on Google news. And now it's,
you have to click each individual topic that you have favored it. It's a whole mess.
They're killing their own algorithm. I mean, I go to Bing now, you know, it's Microsoft for a big
search. It works like Google used to. It's more fair. It's totally one sided. You can't even get
real medical news. You can't get anything about Hillary. It's all controlled. They've gone pure
authoritarian in their desperateness. And I think they've jumped the shark. But Mark, I think you've
hit the heart of this though. You can't force people to watch stuff. And I think they have gone
too far. I think as long as we make a big deal about it, as long as we inform Congress, as long
as our listeners understand it, and as long as our listeners understand this, and viewers,
you've got to hand go to mark dice.com. You've got to hand go to m4.com. You've got to hand share
that go, Hey, this is the verboten. This is the forbidden learn why this is where they don't want
you to go. You've got to go to info or store.com. You've got to get a reelect Trump 45 shirt. You've
got to get a mean like a Wolverine shirt. You've got to get our defeat Democrat censorship sale
50% off on all our best selling items free shipping. We brought the supercell back. You've
got to get the new official app that works really great with live streaming podcast, everything
in full wars.com port slash app. You already are awake. So you're like, Hey, we already know all
this. The public doesn't they are now ripe to be told what's happening. People are so ready to wake
up. Mark dice. Let's move on to this. People go to mark dice.com and also get some of your great
t shirts as well to fund you because it's a war folks. These are war bonds. If you don't buy it,
the enemy wins. Mark and I have already paid monetarily massively, you know, for telling
the truth. We don't care. We just want to win the bullying on the street, the attacks, the
Uber drivers, not driving conservatives, the harassment of conservatives. They clearly are
hitting the streets. We need to hit the streets as well. When they try to censor us in cyberspace,
more and more, we need to do stuff on the streets as well. Can you can you speak to this whole
attempt for them to start a civil war? You know, the Democrat Party is embracing violence as a
whole. The fact that Maxine waters hasn't been widely denounced by every Democrat in Congress
is completely absurd. Their silence is acceptance and they could shut us down online and then
we're going to have people start popping up and peacefully confronting some of these people.
Like back, you know, 10 years ago, really before YouTube, we would see people peacefully
confronting or shouting down from a distance. The live cable news feeds, some of your contests,
I think are fantastic. Maybe it's time for another jam CNN contest where people can get on the air
and jam them because holding signs up at sporting events, they're not going to stop us and we're
not going to get violent like the Democrats. We're just going to be peacefully innovating
and continuing to come up with new ideas. We need to start filling their Twitter feeds and
Facebook pages with more messages. Every time Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter tweets,
he should have hundreds of responses in that thread about the double standards about them
censoring and banning Roger Stone, but allowing other Democrats to be on there.
Censoring Roger Stone for just criticizing CNN anchors or swearing at a CNN anchor.
It's completely absurd, but allowing someone who's calling for the abuse of Donald Trump's children
to still be allowed on that platform. It's absurd. So we need to just get engaged every
thread. I want every time Jack Dorsey tweets something to be filled with hundreds of tweets
responding, pointing out their hypocrisy, linking to certain videos.
Same with Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of Twitter, of YouTube. These people, we're going to show them
who they are. We're going to show their own followers who they are in case they're in their
little echo chamber. And it's critical to just keep pressing forward. And that's why I appreciate
you saying to just go directly to websites. You have to come right to youtube.com slash
mark dice or scroll down to go directly to my channel. You can no longer go to your youtube
homepage and see a variety of videos. That's the point you were making. It doesn't matter if you
have views, you know, tens of millions of views on the video. And it was number one, they downvoted
and will take the same name and put something pro-Hillary on top of it. Again, in fact, you give
a few examples of that because this happens to all our videos now. People have to go directly to it
and realize it's not work. It's a victory. They're censoring us because we're winning. It's so
cowardly. It's so pathetic. They totally make us the underdogs because we're Americana. We're
promoting freedom. In the past, when you would search for a certain title in youtube, it would
show you not the most viewed video, but the most watched video, meaning the most watched time.
So if somebody clicks on a video and clicks off of it, you know, gets a few seconds of watch time.
So if somebody clicks on a video and they stay watching it for two, three, four minutes, that's
rallying. That's tacking up the watch. And they broke their algorithm about what the humans really
voting, crowd sourcing ideas, the knowledge of the crowd, they broke it for this.
Yeah. So again, having most, most watched views can be deceptive. So they changed that model a
decade ago to the most watch time. So my video about Donald Trump's funniest insults and comebacks
has 9 million views, a high amount of watch time. But if you type it in that exact title into youtube,
it's the 51st result. There are 50 other videos, half of which aren't even, aren't even, don't
even have anything to do with it, but maybe have, you know, oh, Trump funny or something about Trump
insults, so and so, and every single one of them is from a mainstream source. Even the Huffington
compost or Huffington Huff Post, I guess they renamed their, their channel has under 2000 views.
And their video is one of the top results NBC, CBS, all these mainstream outlets, which have
just shows what pathetic losers they are. We'll be right back with five more minutes with Mark
Dys right after this quick break in full wars.com. Stay with us.

War Room. We have the clip coming up to start the next segment on our news. Alexander Schumer
just called for more sanctions on Russia. Trump is sending toe missiles to the rebels for a year.
Huge economic operations crushing Russia. I don't think Russia even deserves, but
everything else I agree with Trump on. I see communist China as a threat.
Mark Dice, I really appreciate you and Mark Dice.com all the work you're doing.
You're being blocked and censored. You know, so your average video had a million views.
Now your average has a half million, but it's a real testament that your fans come to the actual
Mark Dice side on YouTube. They got to do the same thing for info wars, the same thing for
everything. And you know, I saw the censorship intensifying a few years ago. So we have our
own streams and info wars.com forward slash show. We have our own videos. We're posting now. It's
very expensive, but we're doing it. So Mark, you know, people said, well, you just get off
YouTube. Well, it's already half the video views in the world. They advertise for us to come there.
We follow the rules, then they cheat us. No, this is fraud. We need to stand up against it.
Yeah, I see so many people want us to put our legs between our tail between our legs and leave
to another platform, but no, we need to fill it with more conservative content. And I think there
was a quote, I think it's from inside manual movie from a decade ago that the greatest currency
is respect. And that's why my fans do the best that I can to earn and gain their respect. And
that's why I've been able to develop such a large channel. Same with you, because nobody respects
CNN. Nobody. Anderson Cooper doesn't respect his audience. He despises them. He's a parasite
praise on him off of them. And these people, their time has come their time. They've missed the boat.
Now they're astroturfing to try to keep up with this modern technology. And we keep crushing them.
And we need the midterms coming in three and a half months. The time flies. We need to schedule
the vote. You need to look at voting in the midterm and in the 2020 election as like paying your taxes.
If you don't do it, the government's going to screw you. And it's a little bit of a hassle. You
got to schedule. And I agree. Let's say we have the red wave that even with fraud looks like we're
going to have. Do they capitulate then or they just get crazier? That I'm not sure. We're in
uncharted territory, but I know that we have to get in touch with our congressperson and educate
them about the censorship on social media. And so we can have more legitimate questions when
these people are testifying. And so we can get new bills perhaps introduced so that we can't
be shut down. No, I agree. That's the key. And please help us with this.
Mike Adams report and Paul Watson report that are on info wars.com. These are scholarly.
These detail it all. And I mean, Mark, we need your help. We need to get this report,
the censorship master plan decoded to the president, which we've done into Congress. Please help us.
I definitely will. I'll be retweeting that as soon as I get off the show. Always great to be with
you, Alex. It's incredible what you guys are doing. And it's incredible to see the attacks
against us. I mean, it's you can't even imagine the things that they that they're doing. And then
they pull them out of their out of their sleeves, literally calling for you to be banned. The
manipulation of the social media YouTube now literally paying $25 million to astroturf YouTubers
embracing, you know, Hollywood celebrities as the new YouTuber, giving them consultants.
I had to figure out how to do this, how what camera, how to do the lighting,
what time to post the videos, how to do, you know, how to make a thumbnail.
All of these people now, the mainstream media, which missed the boat,
they're getting the consultants and the cash YouTube and they're invading and they're propping
them up and they're force feeding and it's still failing. And that's what's so crazy about this is
this is really epic, my friend. And I just have a gut level feeling we're going to win as long as
we just keep pressing the attack. But like you said, we need our own platforms, which you're
building I built, we have to do it. The listeners have to understand they're the only reason
we're still standing. We do respect them because they are, you know, Mark dice, they are Alex Jones,
our listeners, our viewers, our supporters, they're the reason CNN and so many people are upset.
What an incredible time to be alive and thank God for Donald Trump, huh?
He is a godsend. He has delayed the, you know, the bankruptcy, moral and financial of this country,
perhaps decades into the future. And that's why they keep on pressing against him. And
when I can sit in my apartment and make a video and get a quarter million views,
quarter of the audience of CNN, when I'm one guy on a laptop in my kitchen, that is dangerous to
the mainstream establishment when they're spending. And that's your lowball video. Exactly. It's
amazing. People want choice. God bless you, Mark. Great job. Good to be with you, Alex.

You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
And we are the real American free market resistance for the globalists. They claim
the other resistance, yeah, to us. Ali Alexander is about to take over. Put a
consultive loss for activists. All the great work he's done with the Trump campaign, you name it.
Patreon.com, Ali Alexander, Twitter at Ali, OrganizerAmericanPriority.com.
But I wanted to play Chuck E. Schumer's response, and I never got to all these clips
today. If Alexander wants to play him, I've always got a guest coming on about
the globalists trying to crash the economy. Will they be successful? Talk about treason.
You've got Brennan calling Trump treasonous for meeting with Putin when every other president
meets with Russian leaders. They just think you have no memory. But I've got Trump on Hillary's
server, Putin on intelligence and Soros, Putin on compromising info on Trump and Moscow. I may
play that before I go to Alexander. I've got so many of these clips, the warrants coming up
in about 53 minutes. But here's Chuck E. Schumer, when he's this Democrat, globalist,
anti-American guy that sold us out to China. Here he is saying more sanctions on Russia
when Trump, quite frankly, one of the few things he's done bad is beat the hell out of Russia
for no reason. Here it is. Our allies will consider abandoning us, possibly for China and others,
and Putin's Russia will emerge stronger for it. That's what he wants, and that's what President
Trump inexplicably is helping him do. Our Republican colleagues can take steps right now to push back
against this slippery slope the president has put us on. Speaker Ryan today said nice things,
but talk is not enough. We need action, bipartisan strong action, and we need our Republican
colleagues to stand up for the good of this country. I am asking our Republican colleagues
to do four things. First, they can start by refusing to water down and instead decide to ratchet up
sanctions against Russia. This is the globalist trader, this is the globalist who's shelling
America out trying to point at some foreign country and going that's the enemy when Russia can hardly
get its streetlights working nationwide. When they've sold out to China, Hollywood's owned by China
now, and he's just up there like he's the patriot and all of us, red-blooded Americans that believe
the Second Amendment, private property, all of it, we're the enemy. I mean just how are we ruled by
this piece of crap? Let's go back to it. Sanctions against Russia. In the house there is right now
an effort to ratchet these sanctions down. Given what Mr. Putin said today, given the indictments,
given what Mr. Trump said. The indictments, they already had 13 bots indicted, the people
showed up, it's all fake. Ali Alexander is going to take over right now. War rooms coming up,
they'll have coverage of the big historic press conference. It's the left trying to take my free
speech, the left trying to take my guns, the left on TV saying let's bankrupt this recovery.
I mean the Russians were in my business, I'd say they're the enemy, but I don't see them in my
life. I don't see the Russian fingerprints or footprints on anything I'm doing. God, I wish it
was that easy. No, it's the left, it's the globalists, it's the universities, it's the
anti-free speech groups. They're the ones constantly, it's the Antifa, it's these bullies and they
want to imprison Anastasia Sousa, they want to put me in prison and they want to shut me up and
shut you up and they want to kidnap and rape the president's son and they're just, they're a group
of crazy people. So Ali Alexander, thanks for taking over. God bless you and I know you got a
special guest coming on, an economist about, we could probably play the clip of him even defending
it. Bill Maher saying, yeah, I want to bankrupt people and get them under my control. I mean,
that's called feudalism. Ali Alexander, thanks for joining us. Yeah, thank you, Alex. And you
know, America, I can agree with Alex Morris. How are we ruled by these idiots? I mean, you have
these reporters in Finland asking the president of these two countries that occupy 90% of the
nuclear weapons in the world. These stupid dumb questions. I actually liked it when President
Putin described the intelligence gathering process and how impossible it would be to have the foresight
that Donald Trump would run for president, be elected president, or memorize all the businessmen
that are coming to Moscow or St. Petersburg. It was, we're absolutely ruled by idiots. And
you know, I'll tell you, I've got this theory, it's called the Avatar culture. We're all living
in signals. And this isn't just the left, right? The left has virtue signaling. They want to say,
well, we care about the gays, we care about the blacks, we care about the poor, and none of their
policies actually address any of these issues. But the right has much of the same thing. And what
you see from the right now is I was going through my Twitter this morning, and I was like, oh my gosh,
this is a disaster of a press conference. Everyone I know and I respect it
was saying, Trump is selling out the United States. And I even texted the infowars producer and I was
like, I'm going to have some choice words for the president. But I want to make sure that before I
got on the air, before I talked to millions of patriots across the nation, that I listened to
the press conference myself. And I'll tell you, it wasn't night and day, but there was a huge
stark difference from the isolated quotes. And this is what I want to encourage everyone to do.
For the first time ever, I'm going to say, don't listen to me. Don't listen to Alex Jones. Don't
listen to mainstream media. Go watch 35 minutes of reporters, Vladimir Putin, and Donald Trump
talking about these issues and decide for yourself because it was night and day when I read those
quotes and I said, oh my gosh, Donald Trump's throwing America under the bus a little bit.
You know, I get what he's doing, right? He's fighting. There's a whole lot of context,
and that's what they do. Trump is sending tow missiles to Ukraine. Trump is crushing them
on energy. Trump is it's too much. And then he's conciliatory, you know, I guess lubing up Russia
while he does it. I think it's too much actually. Yeah, well, Alex, it's a part of the negotiation
technique, right? So he understands now, this is something that Reagan probably couldn't have
even understood, that the negotiations have to happen in public. So to disrespect Putin is going
to invite retaliation. But if he can retaliate, I think against Russia and the media is not going
to cover that. Well, then he forces Putin at the table. I think that this is strategically brilliant,
even though yeah, he's hitting he says attacking Russia emboldens him with the Russian population.
This is actually the most diabolical anti Russian plan to tell Putin how much he loves him and loves
Russia while we're stabbing him in the stomach, which I want to work with Russia and get their
resources and come together. They're not the chai comms. I see America's destiny as real trade,
like Ron Paul says. I think Trump's over aggression towards Russia is one of his only bad spots.
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm a little bit more hawkish than you. And so we might might diverge a little
bit on it. But you know, he is a hawk. I mean, he's a super hawk. I'm fine with being hawkish.
And I get the Russians respect strength. The Russians don't own Hollywood. The Russians aren't
taking up the chai comms are the problem. Oh, entirely. Entirely. It's our number one geopolitical
foe right now. Exactly. So making it about Russia is a strategic distraction by the globalist
that have sold us out to China. That's the real threat. That's why it's treason to obsess on Russia
all day. A Russian alliance with Russian raw minerals and an infrastructure and their raw
material would take America into the next century with Russia with us. We won't defeat China with
their aggressive stance into the next century if we don't make a deal with China. Bingo. I mean,
make a deal with Russia. Bingo. And this is what Ronald Reagan understood. You know, Ronald Reagan
went from a hawk to a guy who broke her peace. And if we don't take Russia with us into this next
age, it makes us harder to negotiate with these rogue states. It makes it, you know, it destabilizes
North Korea. Exactly. We make a deal with Russia. We have that entire arc through Eastern Europe,
Asia, Central Asia, the whole the whole Crescent. That's the you win the whole game with that.
It's a no brainer. But see, the globalist won't continue crisis politics. And I'd love to be
friends with China, but our own elites put the chai comms in power and are using them for global
domination. Total global domination. You know, I in fact, when I when I have my guests on here
in a couple of minutes, we're going to even talk about that America's elites are eyeing China and
Singapore as their plan B's as they rape and pillage America, they're going to try to force
a recession down our throat here in the next 12 months. And we can only hope and pray that it
doesn't happen before the midterms because they want to take Trump out of power. They ask what's
the headline coming up? Globalist attempting to crash US economy out of midterms. Yep.
Economist globalist attempting to crash US economy out of midterms and held their old TV
saying it. Ali Alexander takes over right now. Really smart guy having an open free debate here.
We'll be right back news wars.com. Get that report on censorship of the internet

Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here
in Leilani Estates but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals,
alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy
metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to
optimal levels. As it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
importantly a good water filtration system will purify it. We all know that the outside toxins
in the water is a serious health issue. InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters but it's
almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower and sink in your home. That's why we're
bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system. The Pro Pure
whole house water filtration system is an advanced four-stage compact filtration system that will
provide water filtration for your entire home removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins
out of your water supply and away from you and your family. With its broad spectrum contaminant
reduction you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
Head to infowarsstore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking
to replace your current rundown systems it's time to go big and go home with the Pro Pure
whole house filtration system today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of
the information war it's Alex Jones. Welcome, welcome, welcome. This is Ali Alexander. I'm
hosting the last hour of Alex's show here on infowars, infowars.com. Go ahead if you're online
and click that share button you're not going to want to miss the next 40 minutes where we're going
to talk about the agenda of the globalists. You know Bill Marr said this earlier they want to crash
the economy to hurt the Republican majority really it's a Trump majority right. We've seen the
Republicans act more conservative, more Trumpian since Donald Trump has called his own party to
the mat and so I'm going to introduce a friend of mine. This is a guy I actually talked to pretty
frequently. I manage my own portfolio. I keep track of the news. I don't follow the you know the
fake news instead I make money on the real news but I always have a couple of people that I put
around me to keep me sane and one of those is my friend Edward Dowd. Edward Dowd is a former
BlackRock guy. BlackRock is making some news today because they're pushing for a Bitcoin ETF
but Ed's no longer associated with them. Instead he's a whoa. He's a red-pilled
Wall Street analyst who agreed to come on today and talk about the possibility of a coming recession
within the next 12 to 18 months. I think frankly it could be sooner but we're going to talk about
this all with Ed. We're going to have a fruitful discussion. Right now he's raising funds for
one of his funds that really indexes and models what the economy is doing. His performance has
been remarkable. It's why I've come to rely on him and he's calling from Hawaii. How are you my
friend? I'm good Ali. Thanks for having me on today. I appreciate it. Yeah I just we just
with my partners we were launching a new firm Ocean Square Asset Management at the Global
MacroHedge Fund. We're pre-launched so we don't have any assets yet. We've been running a model
portfolio since Labor Day of last year so we are in the process of trying to find someone to go in
the business with us and partner with us and give us a seed investor spot. So that's what we're
trying to do but I can share with you what we're seeing now and what I think is going to happen.
I mean obviously I don't know exactly what's going to happen but you know what we're seeing
is starting to concern me from an economic recession standpoint.
Yeah and just to give a little background on some of our private conversations you know
I'm not one you know I love my friends but I'm not one to brag but you know you and I were talking
you know February 5th, 6th, 7th and then boom 8th the market drops we see that massive correction
February you and I were talking towards the end of March I think it was March 25th or 24th
and boom you called that one and I said okay well this guy is seeing something on a macro level
that I'm also seeing at the political level and and you know you told me something that was really
salient you said you know a lot of these recessions are triggered by the Federal Reserve.
Yeah absolutely so it's you know this is not something that's advertised but we talk about
it all the time on Wall Street and typically speaking more often than not a recession is
due to Fed policy error they over tighten financial conditions worsen liquidities was drawn from the
system some sort of excess that had been building in the system is exposed and then they furiously
then play catch up and start to loosen monetary policy but by then it's usually too late and
a recession has taken hold and they're usually always behind the eight ball and I think
given what I'm seeing in the asset classes that we follow and how we're positioned
and we're starting to see you know we're of the opinion that we're in the early stages
of the Fed probably has already made a policy error and it's starting to affect the asset
markets which sends signals to us. So what are some of these signals that you guys over at Ocean
Squared are seeing and that you've modeled your so far successful you know portfolio after?
So we play in bonds so my partners are fixed income I'm equity we're playing bonds currencies
and equities and we started to see technically that the dollar was putting in a you know we follow
cycles was putting in a major four-year cycle low in February we also saw that bonds the US 30-year
Treasury bond was putting in a three-year cycle low or we thought it was so we made some we made
some bets in the model portfolio and we are currently expressing our dollar bullishness by
being short the euro the South African ran the Chilean peso and the Australian dollar
we're still bullish on the on the dollar and I think if there's something needs to be understood
is Trump is very bullish his policies are very bullish and pro-dollar and and so I'm going to
say something that's going to sound pretty crazy but you know it's you know if you look at the
long-term down downtrend of the dollar that downtrend has been broken in the last couple years
and the dollar it's a very long downtrend since going back to the 70s and the dollar you know
had a little correction here the last two years that weakened a little bit but we think the dollar
put in its four-year cycle it could go by the end of this four-year cycle we could we could see it
going back to 121 on the Dixie DXY and that would be the prior top in 2000 and you know I can tell
you I can give you the I think is that technically what we see I can tell you what the fundamental
reasons are if you want to hear those yeah well before we get into that I'll tell you when Donald
Trump won which you know I mean I do this for a living and yet still two three hours into the
night said there's no way there's no way that we're gonna win in fact I was so I was so bearish
on Donald Trump winning that night even though I wanted him to win right I supported him is I
bet my younger friends a hundred bucks a piece saying well we're not gonna win Florida you know
I knew that I could put my money on that and so I lost about four hundred five hundred dollars that
night to to the guys who were you know we were all wearing our MAGA hats we were celebrating
and you know but the next day I got up and I wiped myself off of politics instead I said you know what
I need to readjust my portfolio now that Hillary is not gonna rig the economy for solar get us
into war with Russia via Syria can capitulate to China etc etc and I started investing in some
biotech because what I realized is Donald Trump was a nationalist and a populist but he had
conservative policies that you know have been coming from Cato heritage foundation and they
were all gonna be swooped into the White House these are ideas that hadn't been tested in 30 or 40
years and I was excited to test some of these theories and my stock portfolio has been booming
ever since but I will say you know you hit something that that I thought too I said okay well this
is going to be interesting I don't want anyone to think that we're talking down the economy
you know Trump and the Republicans have been wildly successful at the economy but the market has
grown at such a fast rate that I have some concerns especially when you have the Federal Reserve
especially when you have the globalist especially when you have George Soros especially when you
have China trying to match even with the petrodollar so this is really interesting that you brought up
you know we're a minute away from the break but you brought up something that stuck out to me and
I was betting on a strong dollar whereas everyone was really bullish on gold because they were saying
oh well Donald Trump is unpredictable will buy gold I said no no no no if this guy implements
Republican conservative policies we are going to be American again baby and I'm glad that you
touched that but China seems threatened by this don't they oh absolutely and China's had a very
difficult time of it their stock market has depreciated over 20 it's officially in a fair
market their economy as you and I know they produce you know quarter in and quarter out
seven percent GDP growth rates which if you know anything about if you know anything about fraud
that's a goal seek Excel spreadsheet kind of thing so you know in many ways the Chinese economy
is a little bit like Bernie Madoff on a national scale but you know Bernie Madoff didn't have a
printing press in other countries that would you know help feed him you know help him out if you
get into trouble so China's waiting to blow up China right now is slowing down precipitously
we're playing that but we're short semiconductors I started picking up and very
hold that thought on China we're going to come back after the break you guys are listening to the

let's say china china china china china china china china china china china
you go over to china china china china and we're warning again
recession folks you guys need to know this you can't just trust
people managing your money you also have to be aware which is why i have one of the smartest
guys in the business my friend edward dow we had to cut him off to go to a hard break
but ed you were telling us that china who you know on their balance sheet governing a billion
people said that they've been you know growing at seven percent but you don't think that's the case
and you think that there's other fundamentals that are gonna that you know they're officially in the
bear market you told us so what else are you seeing in regards to china and how that relates to us
and what we need to be on the lookout for right so so i'll get back to my fundamental reasons for
why the dollar is going up as well but let me start with china so china um look it's been
it's been a well-known publicized joke on wall street that the chinese economy numbers that they
present to us are fraudulent but that's been you know we've been okay with that we're gonna not
haha but here we are and china's you know the amount of debt that they've they've accrued since
um you know the early 2000s is eye-popping um there uh you know donald trump is um his policies
are really having an impact on their stock market the trade deficit uh as obviously it's a joke i mean
the amount of um you know they can't hurt us but we can definitely hurt them and trump knows that
not that's the leverage he's using so china stock market has rolled quite significantly and the data
points i was picking up in june with that semiconductors were rolling hard and semiconductors are the
tip of the spear from an economic standpoint they're global um and china consumes a lot of them as
well as you know everybody else so i was hearing that literally orders were just falling out of the
bed uh and things were getting pulled factories that we heard were going to get built those plans
were put on hold these are coming from high level exact executives that i know so you know and then
if you look at the price action of the semiconductors let's let's put in that's mary what i heard with
price action um the semiconductor stocks have um relatively underperformed the general market
they did not make a new high and this last high and they are they are they're looking quite awful
right now so we're we're short you know uh some semiconductor stocks um to reflect our our you know
bearishness on china and and and the global economy and um you know look when the fed the
fed is basically the interest rate of the world and they're raising rates the other central banks
are starting to have to follow even though they don't they don't want to and a stronger dollar
um has caused a liquidity situation in the emerging economies and what the problem the problem is
is that over the last 10 years 15 years since the early 2000s the emerging markets have been issuing
uh debt in dollar denominated um issuance so this is india this is india china turkey united
all of brazil you know all of them and so the amount of the the it's estimated that the dollar
the dollar amount of emerging market debt in dollars is seven to nine trillion so as interest
rates go up um and our currency appreciates the dollar appreciate that's very bad for them they
have to start paying but it becomes it becomes a it becomes a debt crisis eventually if you
look at what's going on in turkey that's exactly what's happening and again as ish yeah so so
what's going on is globally we're seeing the slowing first because of the rising dollar
and eventually i think it makes its way back to the us for you know a potential um you know
slowing of our economy or or recession and the timing of it's unclear but we're seeing
we're seeing that in the asset markets that the yield curve is flattening um we're long we're
long 30 year treasuries because we believe that you know that's you know that yields like i said
bonds are bottomed and we think that the yield curve will invert at some point here over the next
you know three to six months uh the the 1030 curve is down to about 10 basis point
um and that's at levels we haven't seen since 2007 so you know even though things are going great
and by the way um when markets and economies um roll over they usually roll over when things
are very very good and things are very very good but what's going on is the second derivative
is starting to change and the dollar the dollar i believe and the and the fed raising interest
rates are the two causes of this and you know quickly quickly um you know trump is really pro
dollar uh his apologies the corporate tax rates have now brought investment back to this country
thank god thank god yes yeah on the long term that's a good thing short because otherwise we had all
this foreign investment coming in and you know and i'm not opposed to it right we have this foxconn
plant in wisconsin that's going to help governor walker that might help republicans at the end
of the day it's going to help americans and that's important but you know if you go to places like
irvine california i mean i you know i i i'm obviously not a racist i'm not a racist i'm half black
half arab my best friend is vietnamese but when i flew into la and i went around irvine i was like
okay well is this entire town owned by chinese nationals and i was hearing from the locals
there who had been there for decades that yeah basically they go in and they buy these homes
for cash and then when they go back to china they'll leave these louis Vuitton or Gucci bags like
they're buying so much with cash and we were suffering the obama non-recovery so what would you
say to someone who's listening to this and they're saying well this is technical mumbo jumbo
you know obama and his friends and jenny ellen held down the economy trump is bringing it back
how can we possibly reach how can we possibly go into a recession even in the next 10 years well
it just it looks cycles occur and interest rates and liquidity have a powerful impact on the asset
markets and the asset markets lead the real economy so you know again i don't believe there's
going to be a financial crisis i believe this will be a bump in the road and be much like
potentially what happened to ronald reagan uh you know in his uh second uh second year he had a
recession and then things really took off so i don't fear the recession uh and you'll have an
opportunity you'll have an opportunity to buy assets on the cheap and i like that and you know
what that's the great thing that conservatives populist nationalist and republicans are doing
they're strengthening our country right and i i told my friends this in dc they said all lee
you know you used to be with us why are you so much more trumpian you know you're an ideological
conservative why are you kind of getting wishy washy with trump when it comes to naft or tariffs
and i told them simply i'm done watching the obliteration of the culture in pennsylvania
in west virginia in ohio and if i have to go to the dollar store and pay two dollars more for a
product and generations can grow up and date in ohio in and in falling waters west virginia
in scranton uh pennsylvania well then that's good for the country that's good for people and
fundamentally i think it's also a national security issue donald trump believes that we
ought to have some manufacturing base here we ought to have things here and what i find interesting
and i i'd warn people this would happen donald trump is restoring order he's making sovereignty
great again you alluded to it with turkey's doing this china's doing this they're all trying to get
it their currency to be more liquid on the international stage but donald trump is gobbling
it all up with the us dollar it's a very exciting time to be alive and and i agree with you you
know in a recession i'm gonna lean in on these fundamentals that have made people like warren
buffett rich you know i'm gonna bet big on the american people i mean think of it this way always
so the last at least 10 15 years has been a weak dollar policy since the top in 2000 and selling us
out to the globalists and well you know however however you want to categorize it's been a weak
dollar policy well if you look at the long-term charts you look at donald trump's policies are
the dollar's going to be strengthening so what does that mean that means more investment here in
the u.s dollars coming home and of course because the the system in the world globally has been
geared towards a weak dollar there is going to be pain as that regime shift happens and we're
going to see that pain in the form of a economic slowdown but our slowdown will be um way less
than it will be in the emerging economies in china because of their reliance on a weak dollar
and in fact go ahead and that's what it's all about that's what it's all about it's a competition
everyone but on the world stage it's a competition and donald trump wants america to be first after
the break we're going to talk about more strategies we're going to pick edge brain fear not america
first living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here
in leilania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be
concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain
could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of
heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity
filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored
to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what
we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
importantly a good water filtration system will purify it i want to plow into all of this
that i'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that

store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
y'all we are talking about the market we're talking about the market this is sometimes
sometimes it's very hard to talk about the market because people think about the economy
you know the economy is not the market the market's not the economy the market is a part of the
economy and helping us guide us through this in our last segment is edward dowd he is a partner at
ocean squared he's running a model portfolio they're raising funds for their fund and it's been
really remarkable and i've really actually enjoyed our friendship my mother says this she says ollie
sometimes you're too transactional but what i like about our friendship is you share your
expertise with me i share my expertise with you and boy we've called a lot of things right
together and you know i love i love you know if let's throw ed's twitter account up on the screen
but you know i love retweeting you and one of the things that you know you encouraged me to
take a second look at is i'm a technologist you know they call it the thing stocks right but
these things have been growing at such an alarming rate without increasing their their revenues at
the same rate that there's got to be some type of retracement right i mean there was with bitcoin
why wouldn't there be with netflix or facebook especially when they're busy pissing off half
their base the conservatives in america the people who have the money you know are you concerned at
all about these what has been dubbed the fang stocks facebook apple netflix google absolutely so
you know look you know we the way we're positioned we're not short the stock market we're we're
shorting some stocks and we're long some stocks so we're kind of neutral the stock market but
making bets on what we think might go up and might might go down and i told you we're short
semiconductor stocks but we're also short three of the fang stocks one of them has been working
the short term force the other two have been a little problematic for us but we think we're
close we think the stock market is in the process of topping out here short term the fangs i have
some real issues with the fangs a they've been a phenomenal performers their revenue growth has
been great but i think the second derivative on their revenue growth is about to turn i also think
that the regulatory issues that you and i talked about in february and dc are coming at the forefront
and you know i'm watching alex and others being censored by facebook and google and you know
that's not going to sit well with a lot of republican congressmen and today alex talked about
they're going to get some reports to these congressmen to show them what's going on so
it's you know if i'm a betting man technically i see them topping and then i see i see regulatory
action coming down the pike and i think um what's behind the curtain is going to be very very
problematic for them and very very unsettling for lots and lots of people the amount of control
that they have uh over our dialogue in this country and you know i'm i'm not i'm not bullish on these
stocks i think they have a tremendous amount of downside once they turn well what's really
interesting uh which was struck me as interesting is when mark zuckerberg and facebook's been
tremendously kind to me you know not conservatives in general but to me they've sponsored my parties
in dc you know the facebook government team has been absolutely wonderful to me full disclosure
but when mark zuckerberg the ceo and founder of facebook said that well we are willing to accept
regulations on advertisements i thought well that's your moneymaker and i thought well wow he's
really acting like a media institution because he doesn't want to be regulated right in the areas of
speech he doesn't want to be uh regulated in the areas of fairness or censorship they're entirely
willing to take regulation on the advertising front and i have to believe well you're willing to let
your stock price take a hit theoretically because come on more regulation inside of the advertising
space makes the ads convert less right more text more gobbledy gloop more disclosure is going to
lead to fewer people fewer marketing departments and fewer advertisers placing these buys and i
thought wow we really live in such an aurelian system where these companies aren't after money
they're after influence they're after power they're after control and we know once you control thought
you control speech and this is why it's so important for us to you know declare this or
declare that but you know i it's you know it's so salient when you told me that i mean if you look
at the technical case we've got to see some type of retracement and if you look at what some of you
know i you know i don't make it too public but you know it um you know i've talked to a number
of members of congress in fact the house judiciary chairman bob goodlatt is a friend of mine
uh you know i lived in lynchburg for a number of years uh and the congressman out of ronoke
and um you know a number of these other senators and congressmen are very very concerned about
this issue ted cruiser and paul mike lee uh a number of them and i you know i told one major
ceo uh everyone you know on twitter knows i have a relationship with a couple of ceos and um
silicon valley some major ones and i told him i said if y'all don't get your crap together
by january you know you're going to see the ire of the republican party
so long as we are still in the majority and i think that we are going to be in the majority
are other analysts in wall in wall street recognizing that republicans are willing
to put aside some of their conservative ideology and regulate a lot of these spaces
if they're going to continue to come down on consumers in our speech so it's actually the
opposite so let me tell you why the stocks have worked well after um zuckerberg's congressional
testimony last i think was april um so here's the reason why these stocks are hitting slight new
highs is that um it's the belief on wall street that march zuckerberg is now willing to be regulated
but he's going to run he's going to help write most of the regulations and it's going to be
look over here don't look over here and in the net effect is going to actually
um destroy the competition and it's going to be more power to the monopolist so that's that's why
these stocks are going up wall street is betting that it's going to be business as usual and that
the crony capitalism is going to continue that's the bet so so the if you want to and i'm taking
the opposite bet that the populism uh worm is here globalism is over the crony capitalism is
i think it's almost too untenable to get away with it there's too many eyeballs on it
they're trying to censor they're trying to censor and de-platform other people so
my bet is technically we were we were on we were getting exhaustion cell signals on these stocks
and i think i think fundamentally we're going to start to hear some bad news for them on the
regulatory front and also i think i think more and more i think we're going to start to see
whistleblowers come forward i think we're going to we're going to there's going to be more
discovery of of things in the various things that they've been up to so you know this is i'm
actually so the wall street i think has it wrong that's the opportunity that's why i'm betting
against them i think wall street's off on this what is that buy the rumors sell the news or
which what's that quote and would you tell our audience what that means buy the rumor sell the
new yeah well so stocks are a discounting mechanism and um what that means is by the time
you're reading the headline on a stock the news all of it's already been discounted and smart
investors have already figured it out and the stock has already either gone right gone down to
that point or up to the point so so by the time you hear the news it's it's too late yeah mom and
pops are kind of screwed these other guys they're playing with inside information or legally obtained
information and they're playing pre-market you know uh it's not it's not it's not it's not it's
it's not inside information it's they it's it's it's uh call it like um they're putting together
the analyst mosaic they're more informed than the general person uh and they start to become
cautious on a stock and slowly the stock starts to relatively underperform and by the time a stock
you know has to wash out events you know that the news has been revealed for the most part
so so get us back to the dollar so we talked about the fangs we talked about china get us back to
the dollar the final the final case the final case you want to make in 60 seconds on the dollar
okay so we're i believe we're at a four-year cycle low i'm a cycle believer and the dollar on average
has from major low to low is four years and we had it in february interest rate differentials
between us and the rest of the world the fed's been leading so that's going to cause people to
become more attracted to our bonds and our treasuries which will then create a bid for dollars again
trump's policies are very dollar bullish corporate tax rates being lower repatriation of offshore
funds also he's going to have um a budget deficit which is going to crowd out other um countries
and we're going to fund we're going to fund our deficit that way because of the like i just said
the interest interest rate differential so that'll cause a bid for dollars i talked about the nine
trillion in the emerging market debt that's denominated in dollars so effectively those
countries are short the dollar so there's that that'll start to feed on itself and then ultimately
as the global economy slows there's always a safety bid for the dollar so the dollar in my
mind is looking fantastic and long term i'm looking at 121 potentially i know that sounds
insane but that's it it doesn't sound insane if you've listened and been a fly on the wall in
the conversations between myself ollie alexander and edward dowd especially prior to february 8th
march 25th you know i'm bullish on you ed we're uh uh well actually we're at the close of it
you know what i like the dollar let's keep doing that we'll have you back in the future
