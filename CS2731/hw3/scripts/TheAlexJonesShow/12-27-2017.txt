from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this wednesday the 27th day of
december 2017 only a few days left in this historic year i was not going to be here today
i was going to take off and the incredible olyn shroyer the cuck slayer i was going to be hosting
the transmission and he will be in a little bit later but there is so much massive news
that wild horses could not drag me away and coming up in the next two segments i'm
going to break down all of this critical information in great detail i'm going to
break down the secret of why trump is preparing to move against north korea i understand why the
president is doing it but i think a middle ground needs to be found here and i'm going to be discussing
that coming up in the next segment there's a war coming says top marine corps general
warns us troops this is on info wars dot com today ladies and gentlemen author who admittedly
does meet with the cia director of cia told me it's war with north korea within 12 weeks and
that was in november now being released because people have been authorized to basically warn
north korea through public channels continuing report e u planning own olympic team to weaken
national pride i first saw them propose this six years ago it's now being announced ladies and
gentlemen along with an e u army you can't even have a team named after your nationalism this is
globalism in its essence oh and look i didn't cover this last week when they just you know said it
was a terrible idea and that uh i was a bad person and pulled a bunch of lies about me but now the
chicago tribune and others are saying alex jones should be banned from chicago radio that's right
that beyond soviet beyond communist chinese they just outright say ban alex jones from the radio
because i'm a sandy hook denier now let me explain if i wanted to deny the sandy hook ever took place
it's my right to do it we've held debates here a lot of our audience doesn't buy the official story
there are major anomalies but again they threw babies out of incubators in 1990 they claimed
their brains were stomped out turned out it was all a pr firm all a lie if i heard about
babies thrown out incubators again to start a war i would have to question the story until it was
verified or until it was debunked that doesn't mean if it came out that babies were indeed killed
that i am against the babies i just don't trust known liars like cnn that spearheaded that lie
along with uh the democrats and republicans in congress so again christian science monitor when
contemplating war beware of babies in incubators oh my god the christian science monitor doesn't
care about babies they don't care about babies that their brains back down no they're questioning
known liars so again the democrats have gone from denying censorship to openly admitting their plans
for draconian censorship they were planning this year if hillary would have gotten in that's a big
deal and that's why when you spread the videos and spread the articles and spread live links to the
show on facebook twitter youtube and the live video feeds you reach new people our am and fm is
wonderful but we mainly reach a conservative libertarian audience there and that's about 70
percent of our audience actually the big secret is am and fm radio it's gigantic um three four
million a day tune in over 200 stations now that said what really matters is reaching the new people
the people that have only seen the cliches the lies about info wars where the globalists have
pre demonized us and and force feed this info about us on google facebook and twitter it's only
you that can bypass that so that's coming up also trump defies media doubters by signing tax cut bill
before christmas he was forced to before christmas as i said if he wasn't gonna sign it and also
trump tears into golden showers dossier calling crooked hillary pile of garbage and the fbi
tainted and the big news the big news we have more somali striking again us women stand 14 times
by somali migrant media go dark we love our somalis we love our muslims and then i'm going to get
into the media spinning it and demonizing that only the rich get money from this tax cut i'm
going to give you the secret of that and more straight ahead i'm alex jones spread the word
mike in arizona here on the air worldwide go ahead oh alex you can rent any day of the week
thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save america
and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well and as a long
time info words listener i want to say thanks for the awesome brain force anthro plex my girlfriend
would like to say thanks for the anthro plex thank you i use the bio true selenium the super
blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans the super blue is awesome
and thank you so much alex for the info words life products they are quality i can't wait to get
some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy absolutely we because
then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's
a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and
ourselves we can take our country back crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex
jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war ladies and gentlemen again it is
incredibly hard to believe that we are already in the last three and a half four days of 2017
it is wednesday december 27th 2017 we're going to be live here for the next four hours with this
broadcast and then we're going to have rob doing others hosting for oan shroyer but oan shroyer
isn't on vacation he's going to be hosting the rest of this transmission coming up in about 30
minutes but there's so much huge breaking news i had to come in first today because there's just
just so much unfolding but of course oan will do an excellent job as well where to begin
let me get into the situation with north korea first and just let the audience know that i
don't want war with north korea only an insane person would want that because it could easily
draw in russia and china but i wanted to give you trump's calculus on this because it's been
left a bit nebulous in the media as to why this is happening it's bigger than north korea and the
threat of north korea is obviously a lot bigger than north korea and it's beyond north korea
basically already having icbms that can hit us territories and clearly hit the us west coast
delivering payloads evident shows that probably can't deliver payloads to the central or eastern
areas of the united states with those payloads coming in back into the atmosphere with their
single warhead technology undisturbed the real reason this is happening is that under global
strategic tension as a big new brazilian ski doctrine which was an expansion of the david
rockefeller un doctrine of creating a destabilized world playing countries off against each other
deindustrializing the nations and then using the crisis of war or the threat of war to consolidate
power in the hands of the multinational corporations and their governmental combine
combine control arms like the un like the imf the world bank and now the tpp and and that's their
admitted globalist plan america is to be a military reservation with only military forces just like
the classic 1970s film rollerball kind of created a hollywood style cosmology to explain their system
where you have the energy sector and then you have the weapons sector and you have the technology
sector and you've got the book then if you're a technology sector you have to farm that out evenly
so no one ever gets a toehold on the other and so war becomes obsolete but from the beginning
globalism was set up to actually cause war against the poor war against the nation state war against
the family war against the individual and was a kind it was a deceptive fraud we have the former
heads of the devos group and others going public saying globalism was a fraud globalism was a lie
globalism is a giant authoritarianism and so macArthur in july of 1953 was relieved of command
by then president uh harry s truman for refusing to let the communist chinese come in and overwhelm
and kill our troops there at the yalu river three million came in we'd already been fighting several
million chinese with maybe one tenth of force and kicking their butt so in came the chinese and human
wave attacks and macArthur before they ever got nukes before they ever took over the region said
we got to take them out now we got to deal with the communists now and he was withdrawn from command
old soldiers never die they just fade away and that was the beginning of modern globalism as we
see it now and the strategic tension was created and north korea was used as a set piece to prop up
china prop up communism minister pan and control the whole area now that that said i don't want to
have a war with north korea but they've now been given the missile secrets by the clintons and the
globalists and now the communist chinese they've been given the delivery systems as a pretext to
be the trigger for a future china war with the us and that's a fact china is planning that
and they think russia is going to be drug in trump wants to do a behind-the-scenes deal to bring russia in
and there have been previous deals behind the scenes with nixon and others where the russians
wanted to do a preemptive strike it's also happened under eisenhower on the chinese
and the us wanted to do a strike as well back and forth and then both sides would renege when it
came down to the eleventh hour to launch the preemptive strike together against china so russia
doesn't like china even more than doesn't like the us because china is right on its doorstep and has
been a historic problem in many cases and you can look all this up this has happened throughout
history so north korea has been put there by the globalist as a detonator and i understand their
people are starving and i understand it's horrible and i understand these big sanctions only hurt
them mainly and and i don't like it but i'm telling you the strategic thinking of president trump in
all of this is that we have to look strong because the globalist the cfr that worked for the communist
chinese hinted at this during the campaign and then once the president was president elect
that they were going to use north korea blustering and rolling out its new weapons systems that
had been keeping quiet to basically embarrass trump and to create a crisis for trump that he would have
to back down from thus blunting us power globally so that we again could be vulcanized politically
and not be the dominant world unipolar power and then i get putin wants a bipolar power and all that
and so do i i don't want the us to be the world empire but the point is the globalist of the
world empire right now playing off the three major power blocks and they want to be able to
bring the united states into check and checkmate if need be with the north korean detonator so
you're getting the real briefings the president's gotten and you're getting the real strategic
thinking behind the whole ball wax and so by bringing this war to the fore now against china
making russia stand down this will encircle and geopolitically break china's back as it
attempts to roll out a global takeover from latin america to eastern europe uh too much of africa
which china is doing via a program where it double crossed the united states behind the scenes
politically with spies and strategic influence and financial influence with over 10 000 front
companies inside the united states so this is all about china and it's about forcing russia
into a new alliance with the united states that trump had already planned and been setting up with
general flin strategically because russia's christian anti globalist and of course anti radical
islam and putin was beginning to orbit into that believing it could happen but trump has been
partially blocked by the neocons by the democrats by the brzezinskiites by the globalist into that
strategic program and so right now trump is battling with the globalist in a game of super
branksmanship with north korea with the u.s prepared to strike by february they're all
telegraphing that and they mean it and they're go go go they're going to go it's not a bluff
if russia doesn't stand down and side with us then china will roll over north korea will be fully
isolated forced to sue for peace and there can be some type of new armistice and a program to begin
merging in the next decade the north and the south and ending strategic crisis ending strategic
pressure ending the so-called system of balkanization strategic tension is the proper
term but they've got a lot of subterms to it so that's where this is this is trump saying
we're not going to back both sides anymore we're not going to back radical islam we're not going
to have fun civil wars we're not going to do this the problem is McMaster and others are globalist
they're still working behind the scenes trying to sabotage that because trump's still working
off a plan that others in the pentagon that are patriots in general flin and general jones and
others had developed that trump bought into during the campaign but he's being sabotaged and because
of that i don't think it's safe to play this branksmanship with china and russia when especially
we've got traders within our midst and under command and control system that are communist
chinese agents because the infiltration is not russian and if it was russia i'd say it all day and
you know say the hell with russia russia can barely fend off the globalists and is trying to
reindustrialize and build its population and stabilize russia is in a stabilization phase
the globalists are mad because they can't get control of it right now just like they want control
of the us back and only have partial control right now so that's the real strategic global
lay of the land ladies and gentlemen that's the breakdown of this entire system as it stands right
now and uh i think we should have a real discussion about this we'll be right back there've been more
somali stabbings in the u.s we love our muslims oh they're so good

war ladies and gentlemen we are back live i am your host alex jones oan shroyer is coming
up again live in the next segment now we're not just seeing globalism get rid of the borders
we're not just seeing threats by the unelected e you that masqueraded as a trade deal and
is now a dictatorship we're not just seeing them threaten 100 000 euro fines against poland
hungry and others if they don't accept over a million islamic quote migrants invaders
every year no we're first heard about this six years ago and now the e u is openly debating
it in closed sessions and members of the e u parliament that's ceremonial have now learned
of it and ukip is reporting on it report e u planning own olympic team to weaken national
pride because whether it's spain or germany or france they cannot allow people to have their
own teams now again they'd announced this years ago for decades out in the future now they're
talking about it coming up in just the next few years e u planning own olympic team to weaken
national pride superstate plotting unified team for anniversary of hitlers berlin games
european union officials are reportedly trying to form an e u olympic team for the 100th anniversary
of the 1936 berlin games that will devalue european national sovereignty bill ethridge
representative ukip's e u parliament broke the news to the daily express revealing that
covert discussions are being held amongst e u officials behind closed doors there have been
quite a lot of conversations about it among the members of parliament and it was being taken quite
seriously by some of them he said they're using the word solidarity which tends to be codeword
for even closer union now they're talking about an e u military invading countries
if they try to pull out which speaks to their plan to create a united states of europe now
continuing ladies and gentlemen speaking of globalism let's get to this report that i mentioned
earlier this is out of worldnet daily dot com us woman stabbed 14 times by somali migrant
media go dark i see in local news every couple days were somali stabbed somebody because that's
the culture look at somebody wrong they just stab you you know women are seen as is as animals are
sold on slave blocks sold on slave auctions and then comedy central makes jokes and goes what are
slave blocks very very sick people uh morgan everson was stabbed 14 times by somali man while
walking home from december 13th there's a lot of reports out there too in germany they think
dogs are unclean the uh the somalis do they always call them germans they go german man stabbed
with german woman and it's some you know invading foreigner morgan everson was walking home in
downtown minneapolis about 8 30 p.m on december 13th when a black man got out of his car chased
her down tackled and stabbed her repeatedly the feisty 26 year old frantically fought back
because she's racist kicking scratching and screaming for help at some point neighbors heard
her screams came to help her attacker described as a somali man his early 20s about five foot seven
with a slight build and wearing gray stone washed jeans ran away and then it goes on to the media
cover up and i think it shouldn't be reported i agree i think it's racist she didn't die of
course i'm being sarcastic here's another one abc news woman stabbed multiple times in uptown on
walk home from work but again you're not gonna find out that it was another one of the cultural
enrichment folks that did it now let me hit this article because this is really important
trump signed the tax bill early and as he said in the speech he had to because
they were saying that it was all a hoax he wasn't going to sign it trump defies media
doubters by signing tax bill before christmas i didn't want to folks but again they said i
wasn't keeping my promise i'm supposed to sign it in january now let's move on to this they've
got articles it's on info wars dot com bloomberg world's wealthiest became one trillion richer
in 2017 billionaires can thank trump for explosion wealth but see the globalists they
they said they don't want even exploding wealth for themselves they want our wealth to go down
that makes their wealth worth even more they want austerity they want total control and so they
spend it like oh look the rich people got richer yeah the stock market the new jobs the industry
but that's how we get more jobs and more factories if we have rich people that invest back in the
culture and our austerity brokers of eugenics to consolidate wealth which is jeff bezos and zucker
burg and bill gates and all of their own admissions so again people are saying well it's only a few
thousand dollar tax cut for the average person and then if you have kids it's two thousand dollars
extra per child so that's like four thousand now and okay the corporate tax goes from 38.9 down to 20
or whatever china's still 15 it's not about what you just get right up front and even though it's
substantive or the 50 plus companies giving extra bonuses because of it it's about the fact that it
gets the economy going even more creates a boom which always drives up wages not with fake minimum
wage hikes that only make jobs contracting about economy but booming economies when wages go up
systemically historically so they know this and they've been trying to fix the economy and hold
the country underwater and the globalists admit that so trump's job's really easy if he can remove
the artificial globalist tariffs like us having the highest corporate taxes in the world which
we've now done look at the stock market already exploding look at retail sales the best in decades
eat despite amazon things are coming back and they keep going well somebody making 60 000 a year
only gets a thousand dollars extra blah blah blah it's it's the jobs coming back it's it's the
companies being able to move here that want to be here but had to leave because the globalist
put in internal tariffs in the united states designed to ship our jobs overseas and bring us to heal
and they're in a battle to implode the economy they're in a battle to stop trump so that's why
i'm so vitriolic in defense of the president because you know a man by his enemies the globalist
hating they're trying to sabotage our recovery that's a recovery of the country's sovereignty
not just prosperity and the prosperity goes hand in glove with that and that's why i back trump so
so hard so using class envy going oh look great year for the rich in 2017 yeah jp morgan chase
made record profits goldman sacks did and despite the fact that they gave 100 of their money to
hillary and none to trump he brought in policies that were so good for the country that their profits
exploded but then the globalists and the socialists and the bernie sanders go look at the rich people
getting rich you don't want that you want good rich people that bring wealth back to the country
not globalist rich who to a man and a woman were against trump because they're greedy and want to
consolidate and want control they don't want wealth they don't want a renaissance they don't
want prosperity here or in russia or in china or in mexico or in india or anywhere

fuzzi operation you're listening to the alex jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're
listening to the alex jones show well we are back live from christmas i hope everybody out
there had a great christmas with loved ones and family and friends i know that i did and i hope
everybody is recovering from those good times sometimes there's a bit of a christmas hangover
here but one thing that doesn't have a christmas hangover is the economy and this is something
that trended all of 2017 they think it could trend again in 2018 and there was a poll on
drudge today that has i think maybe a quarter million votes right now it just went up this morning
and the poll is what is the biggest story of 2017 you've got the economy boom
hurricanes las vegas massacre russia probes sexual misconduct trump first year worldwide
terror attacks north korea or other i went with the russia probe because this seems to dominate
the news cycle every day however the people voted and trump's first year got over 50 of the vote so
everybody has been following trump's first year and if you think about it as an overall story it
is the best and i think that you know the russia probe kind of goes along with that economy boom
gets 16 percent sexual misconduct gets 11 percent los vegas massacre gets just under seven percent
and so on and i was thinking about this with the economy being the second biggest one you know
that's when people go to the the voting booth despite all of the pontification and issues
most people vote for the candidate that they think is going to do the best for them financially
do the best for the economy i think that obviously had a lot to do with why trump won but
you know what in fact i bet you i bet you i bet the crew could find this i bet you the stories
that cnn and msnbc ran a year ago or just over a year ago saying trump is going to crash the
economy i bet you they haven't even erased that in fact guys see if you can find that do you
remember about a year and a half ago just over a year ago the story was how trump is going to
crash the economy trump is going to crash the stock markets oh oh right right and then i've got
i mean i've got so much financial news here it's a joke crash the economy what happened to that
oh there's the economist the economic consequences of donald trump the economic
consequence okay uh cutting taxes uh stock markets keep hitting records uh he's cutting
into the government deficit spending i mean yeah these consequences i mean i don't know what i'm
gonna do oh my gosh it's so bad so look at this stack of news that i have great again mastercard
reports reports biggest holiday season ever and you can say is that good or bad is that just bad
for the credit debt well regardless people are spending money consumer confidence is up and it's
good for the economy you've got signs point to strong us shopping season that's right they're
saying this was a record christmas season for shopping record is that because christmas is
back is that because the economy is back is it because of both us department store stocks jump
on holiday spending record oh there's all these financial records stock records sales records
could 2018 surprise the same outsized gains is 2017 that's from cnc nbc oh oh i thought that the
economy was going to collapse collapse under trump no i guess that didn't happen world's
wealthiest become one trillion dollars richer i'm not sure how to take that of course the rich
are going to get richer when there's more money so that's kind of a given that's like the people
complaining oh the rich got the biggest tax the rich got the biggest tax cuts well the rich pay the
most taxes so of course they got the biggest tax cuts then you got social security beneficiaries
hit record almost 62 million i take that with a grain of salt because the social security program
was about to go bankrupt a few years ago and then they extended it but this is just an example of
government spending that we can't afford and another example of this is the welfare state
you have unemployment hitting record lows and many departments you have food stamps usage and
welfare usage on the decline where it was a record high under obama here's a piece put together
to just show you the mindset of people that are on food stamps it's all about dependence
and it's not about working for yourself it's all about entitlement and not actually taking
responsibility here's that clip i know people they work three jobs and they live next to
somebody who doesn't work at all and the person who's not working at all and has no intention
of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his and her
ass off and it's not going to happen not going to happen give me my food stamps do you really want
to work or you just you just want to get a free check there's a sign behind you this is Waverly
Job Center you have any intention of going in to get a job or you're just gonna get the food stamps
not looking for a job why should i have to go work at retail and deal with snobby customers
why why should i have to dare choose to do that we call the department of children and families
to see what they've been doing to help DCF says Hillsboro Kids Incorporated has been helping by
paying Adam's rent even providing her furniture Adam says it isn't enough somebody needs to pay
yeah not me not me though somebody needs to pay for it but not me well they're your kids man
exactly so pay for them honestly i don't want to work but i'm not going to i wonder if they
got drug tested to get these food stamps if they'd still sign up for them okay this is not a joke
just give me my food stamps i'm asking for they are not incapacitated in any way or they you know
they don't have a mental or physical disability that's documented and or could be observable
more counties will join them as federal exemptions to the requirements expire now that unemployment
is below 10 for each affected county i felt really bad about being on food stamps for a while
they're just for people who really really need it i thought and i'm like living this flippant
lifestyle like in francisco do you think you really really need it well yeah and eventually
i just sort of realized that even though i'm 24 like i still have responsibilities i still have
like hopes for my future wait you have responsibilities or we have responsibilities to pay for you
really need it are you i'm confused how do you feel about that i'm comfortable with it and i feel
like i hate working from a government do you feel guilty about using your food stamp card when you
have $850,000 in the bank no no i don't i'm i'm going by the rules and um if they need to change
their rules they can change their rules but i don't see i'm doing anything wrong how much do you
collect and benefit i have a feeling there's a rule change coming and i get medicaid and
give me my food stamps so let's actually get the numbers here guys um food stamp usage hit a record
high under obama in fact if you can find a graph that would be even better because you've got the
graph you know it's a line graph and it's kind of slowly going up and then obama gets elected and
it's just like a just goes just right off the chart you know and so you say well that's nice
it's nice to help people you know they need some help even if you know they ended up in that situation
because of themselves you know let's just help them out well see there's a problem with that
a it sends us into more of a debt they just had the article up there food stamps up over
70 under obama if you guys could find a graph that's really illustrative of what happened but
the real negative consequence as far as the people are concerned is now they feel entitled
you see once you've been granted a lifestyle that allows you to be a bum and get paid and not have
to work and then you develop a thought process and a mental makeup that says oh well why should I
have to take responsibility for my kids the government pays for it and that's not just rhetoric
that is literally their thought process that is what they actually believe so then what happens
well they can never become a contributing member of society they don't want to work they don't have
to work they just want their entitlements so there's constant negatives to this and that's why
trunk wants to bring jobs back so you can get these people back to work feel your body with carnivore

to the alex jones show if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones well trump said we're gonna make
christmas great again and then we did i think a lot of people had a great christmas the economy
had a great christmas and then in a master troll video you had benjamin net and yahoo send out a
video i saw it on twitter i'm sure he posted it everywhere where benjamin net yahoo wished us
a merry christmas from the capital of israel jerusalem just sticking his finger right in the
un's eye again who is the un to tell israel where their capital is i mean give me a break
then you have israel to name train station near jerusalem's western wall after trump
up so there's just some news there but in the last segment you heard us talking about these
people on welfare and on food stamps and there was one clip in there where the guy asked the
the guy standing in line to get his food stamps there's a sign right behind him that says now
hiring so the guy says well okay obviously you know you're a little short on money or whatever
you're having some financial hardships that's why you're coming here to get the welfare of
the food stamps he's like yeah yeah he's like you know there's a uh yeah there's the sign right
behind he's like yeah you know they're uh they're hiring right behind you it's the job center right
behind you get a job and they all just line up and they get their food stamps and they go right
past the job center and they don't get a job so it just made me think of something here in austin
texas austin is a expansive city right now i mean booming they can't even keep up they literally
can't even keep up the infrastructure because the population is getting so much more dense
they can't build enough skyscrapers they can't build enough apartments and one of the things
that comes with that is there's a lot of jobs here a lot of jobs and sure a lot of them are
going to be in the service industry but that's what i mean that's kind of where you have to start
sometimes to get a footing in in the economy and in the job marketplace they don't want a job
i'm telling you it is the craziest thing here in austin you can go through a shopping center
and you'll see three or four businesses or restaurants whatever now hiring on the sign
and then you leave the shopping center and there's five people begging you for money
and and look i'm from st lewis where homeless people are actual homeless people i mean like
they they are just it's bad for them and you can find that in austin too they have a homeless
shelter here but there's there's homeless people in austin they're not even homeless they just don't
want a job so they get the food stamps they get the welfare and then they panhandle on the street
and then they live in an apartment perfectly fine they're not homeless they're bums a bunch of
bums man i just never understood that lifestyle but anyway uh getting back to some of the news here
here barack obama has been doing the trump follow-up tour where trump goes to india obama
goes to india trump goes to china obama goes to china trump speaks here obama speaks there
he's just following it up trying to you know just get a little shiv right into trump whatever he's
trying to accomplish that's that's how obama operates because he loves this country so much
he wants to undermine the president of course he already did that by spying on trump tower
uh and by making sure the doj and the fbi could work behind the scenes to make sure trump didn't
get elected yeah we'll have more on that later but barry obama sat down with prince uh harry
and prince harry is the one that's been in the news because he's about to marry uh some actors
from america i kind of liked prince harry when he was kind of the bad boy and went against the
establishment now i i was questioning it and now he seems to be full on liberal and then he
does this interview with barack obama now we're going to play a couple of these clips but it's it's
this is hilarious to me for multiple reasons one because you're going to hear what obama says and
it's going to be very revealing but two for the people watching this on the internet this is like
the weirdest setup i've ever seen for an interview you would think that prince harry and former
president barack obama could get like a nice studio like a nice podcast studio or something
but they're like sitting in some civic center with some like old microphones it's the weirdest thing
and it's kind of to me illustrative like you are the old guard look at that what they can't find
anything nicer than that i'm sorry but that is they got a printer in the background i mean it's
just like a whole awkward deal going on and i don't even care again it's just like this was
symbolic to me your these are this is the old guard nobody cares about these people's opinions
anymore prince harry sweet man you're gonna get married to an actress oh wow it's all over the
tabloids whoo oh obama he's got to see that's how obama thinks he's like oh prince harry he's
been in the news i gotta i gotta get on this podcast i gotta do something to undermine this country
so uh let's play the uh first clip we got two of these clips let's play the first when harry
met berry clip do i have to just be faster today no no no it's okay but i need the brooch accent
but if you start if you start using terrible audio quality um the answers you're probably gonna get
like it's the face the whole thing is just awkward oh okay i don't want to see that face but it's um as
you know that for 40 minutes that'd be 20 minutes i can't even hear what they're saying for the audio
is so pathetic and we hope to use the whole thing as a podcast okay so i'm ready when it went
you guys have sound you guys this is sounding great we're all good yep you know your sound
what's going on what are we talking about uh what it's it's it's it's fun i'll interview you if you
want no no let's keep it this way i much prefer that okay so i don't know when uh prince harry
became a journalist but somehow he lands the interview with obama uh let's go to uh by the way
again that's their that's their actual audio i mean that's that's the awkwardness of this whole
thing now let's go to the second clip we share the same kind of mindset and the outlook on on on the
charitable sector uh on on foundations and mainly on on the youth of the youth of today the young
people of this world are incredibly inspirational well enough to invite him to your wedding oh i don't
know about that that's um the we haven't put the uh the invite all the guests that's all we want to
care about is the wedding you know who knows whether you can be invited to a royal wedding
that's surprise stop the presses it's a royal wedding all right so that was actually a second
interview uh there were two two things that obama said here that i found funny i'm just going to
read them to you directly this is a quote from obama from the interview i still care about
making sure the united states in the world is a place where kids get a decent education uh what
did you for the inner cities in chicago and their school system where people who are willing to work
hard are able to find a job that pays a living wage now that's funny because wages went down
and unemployment went up under obama so i guess he's just a miserable failure that we're conserving
the amazing resources of our planet that future generations can enjoy the beauty of this place
like we did uh that's a strange way of putting we're going to shut down america's energy sector but
okay but here's the real ditty this is the one that just gave me butterflies inside obama says
one of the dangers of the internet is that people can have entirely different realities
what they can be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases see don't you
see you can't think for yourself the internet is a open flow of information that may force you to
analyze and and critically think you can't do that obama and the news is supposed to do that for
you he goes on the question has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a
multiplicity of voices allows a diversity of views but doesn't lead to a balkanization of society
and allows ways of finding common ground and he goes on to talk about how everyone basically used
to get their news from three sources and how that was better it was better when people only got
their news from three sources that way everybody knew what was going on and there weren't these
different realities now that we have because of the internet because of twitter in fact guys look
for this in fact i just remember look for the clip of matt lauer interviewing george bush this is
one of the greatest moments in television history where matt lauer mentioned something about the
internet news uh you know getting trump elected or whatever and george bush was like yeah you know
back when there were only three news outlets you were actually relevant and then you can see the
face on matt lauer he wasn't you know he wasn't locking anyone in his office at this time so
he was just doing an interview and you can see his face he's like oh it's like a gut blow president
bush is laughing he's like yeah you used to be relevant before the internet because that's the
point they are irrelevant they have no relevance their only relevance was in their ability to
control and manipulate information so now that the internet has caused them to lose that ability
they tell you you can't think for yourself it's dangerous to go on the internet and look at info
wars you might see something there you don't know about i'm sorry when was the last time any of the
major news networks covered wiki leaks you wouldn't get any of that that's why the internet is good
yeah there's the clip so it's amazing to me that they are literally freaking out right now
they wanted net neutrality so they could shut down their competition in the information war
they didn't get it hillary would have done it but now obama is telling you stay away from the
internet it might be dangerous it might cause you to think critically and then you might have a
different opinion from that guy you can't have that maximize your potential and take your body

you're listening to the alex jones show
live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
oh insurer here filling in for alex we're going to take some of your calls in the next hour
roger stone hosting the fourth hour but did you know there were actually planned terror attacks
over christmas that got foiled that's right here's our own leon macadoo breaking it down
there's new information coming out on the would-be domestic terrorist everett erin jameson
he had planned to carry out a christmas day attack at pier 39 in san francisco uh he was arrested
by the authorities after he told the fbi of his plan to carry out this atrocity he said it would
be perfect the pier would be packed with people so he's obviously mentally ill but this guy is a
former us marine who converted to islam two years ago and paul joseph watson is now reporting
that he was also an anti trump antifa supporter um he was recently liking a lot of uh different
antifa groups on facebook um berkeley antifa antifa california sacramento um and he was also
liking a number of other far left pages including trump resistance movement things trump supporters
say us democratic socialist uh he also loved the young turks cnn buzzfeed aljazeera and he was
also sympathizing with a number of other pro muslim pages this is interesting because it shows
that jameson's political ideology was kind of a mixture of radical far left thinking and islam
now watson points out how the media is reporting about the fact that jameson had recently been
liking pro-terrorism content on facebook that he was showing his support for that isis inspired
halloween truck attack that took place in new york but what the media is not telling you
is the fact that he's also liking and linking with cnn buzzfeed and these antifa groups anti
trump groups and as we have reported back in 2015 the isis manifesto black flags from roam
actually encouraged its supporters to go to these far left protests and link up with these
leftist activists because they talk about sharing broadly the same goals as radical islamists do
european muslims are lying with left wing activists how will this happen have you ever
been at a pro-palestine anti-israel protests you will see many activists who are not even muslims
who are supportive of what muslims are calling for the fall of zionism it is most likely here
that connections between muslims and left wing activists will be made and a portion from them
will realize that protests are not effective and that armed combat is the alternative so they
will start to work together in small cells of groups to fight and sabotage against the financial
elite and so now we're actually starting to see that taking place as well back in november paul
joseph watson was tweeting about a recently released fbi field report that antifa radicals
were meeting with islamic terrorists to obtain weapons and training and that they have improvised
explosives being stored on college campuses so why is the media failing to talk to you about the
would-be terrorist connections with antifa well let's not forget that we have just recently had
a spate of glowing reports of antifa what to wear to smash the state is it okay to punch a nazi in
the face who are antifa they're just these little political whippersnappers that are standing up to
fascism of course they failed to link their readers to this fbi field report showing that the
antifa is receiving weapons and trainings from isis or radical islamists they also failed to
mention how the activities of antifa have been officially labeled domestic terrorist activities
by the department of homeland security who is worried about the increasing violence
happening within this far left group bet your bottom dollar if this want to be domestic terrorist
uh ever at jameson had been liking alex jones and info wars and other right being conspiracy
websites that would be front page news alex jones has done it again he's radicalized another
would-be domestic terrorist but no they don't want to draw your attention that these people are more
aligned with the political ideology that's being spouted off over at places like cnn and the young
turks and buzzfeed and the the democratic socialist of america and isis oh and you won't believe
what cnn is doing now we'll be right back please listen carefully because i'm about to point out

worldwide it's alex jones president trump has said he hopes to unify the country have you in the
first month seen him do or say anything that in your opinion would be an attempt to heal the wounds
of the election well first of all there's only been one month in office and so it's a you know he's
got four years secondly i think you have to take the man for his word that he wants to unify the
country and we'll see whether he's able to do so it's hard to unify the country though with the
news media being so split up when i was president you know you mattered a lot more mattered a lot
more mattered a lot there's george bush telling rat lauer this was not rat lauer locking him in his
desk like he apparently did with uh you know interns or whatever uh this is george bush telling
rat lauer right to his face you're irrelevant bro sorry you're irrelevant and that's why obama
uh in his interview with prince harry was saying it's too bad that everyone doesn't go to three
sources for news anymore we can't control the information we used to be able to control the
information we could get away with starting wars like the golf of tonkin incident we could get
away with lying about weapons of mass destruction it was so easy for us then to lie to the american
public and then just eat it up because we controlled all the news sources but now with the internet
and info wars well we don't know what to do it's out of control they're actually getting the sources
they're getting the information out there to the people and the people are thinking for themselves
we need to shut this down and that's what hillary would have done had she had gotten in office now
this is this has really been tough for cnn cnn in fact i don't know if cnn had its worst year
ever in ratings this year but it was bad it was bad they got eclipsed by msnbc now can you imagine
rachel madow beating you in the ratings a literal cartoon character cut out of man dark
so she now beats cnn that's how pathetic cnn is so what is cnn doing they're going full tmz full
paparazzi and this also shows you how obsessed they are with donald trump oh you think cnn hates
trump they may but they are obsessed i get don lehmann cnn would live in trumps pocket if they could
don lehmann would live in trumps underwear yeah i'm gonna say he would he would live in trumps
underwear just so he could report on a fart so here's cnn a reporter hiding in the bushes to film
president trump playing golf i'm angry tweety the president was back at it once again so there's the
image this is from cnn there's someone hiding in a tree they're literally hiding in a tree to get
this footage of donald trump playing golf he was also going after i mean talk about sad no news to
report on no family to celebrate christmas you're gonna hide out in the bushes i don't know who that
cnn reporter was but maybe he should go work for tmz because i think they're actually doing better
than cnn now but folks the reason why we are competitive the reason why they freak out because
info wars exists is because we're supported by you we aren't supported by big advertising firms
we aren't support we don't get any i mean google ads won't even put us on there anymore they just
shut us down you know youtube tries to demonetize us so we have to go full independent and we
make products that allows you to support us so that we don't have to rely on anyone else but

key right now there's some uh there's some illnesses going around so you're definitely
going to want to get some silver bullet folks let me tell you okay what i'm going to do here is i'm
going to go ahead and give out the phone number and we're going to start aggregating your calls
we'll take them sometime uh during this hour 1-877-789-2539 1-877-789 alex and we will be taking
your phone calls in this hour and a little bit into the next hour let me just uh let me just
cover some of this news here oh oh you know i'm a little upset because
i've always kind of been a proponent for global warming i've never really liked winter
much i don't even really like snow i did have a white christmas in st lewis but snow i'm not a
fan of snow so i like the fact that i moved down to austin here and i barely have to put up with
any winter but boy this this global warming thing is just failing miserably international
falls minnesota drops to record low negative 37 degrees near record cold new year's eve
expected in new york city unforgiving cold snap will engulf eastern two-thirds of the nation
throughout new year's day let me just let's just look at some of these temperatures we're expecting
here over the weekend and so our audience across the states can be like wow we're about to get a
record low here minneapolis is expecting a low of negative 15 milwaukee expecting a low of negative
two st lewis expecting a low of negative nine uh i lived in st lewis for 26 years and i can only
think of two other occasions when it was consistently in the negatives so that is very rare okloma city
negative one low dallas is expecting a low of 11 chicago negative one detroit four cleveland 11
indianapolis minus five i mean the list just goes on and on so i guess that global warming thing
isn't working rats that's too bad i was kind of hoping for it i kind of wanted beachfront property
in st lewis or austin or wherever i mean everywhere's going to be a beach when global warming kicks in
you know the amazing thing about it is you have people the reason why global warming is
beyond politics and why people get so angry about it is because it's it's it's actually about earth
and it's about survival and it's about humanity where the liberal media complex with you know
president obama al gore and such other figures have sold the false bill of good saying that we
don't care about the planet we're killing the planet coal's killing the planet mining's killing
it's all killing the planet it's all global warming and you say okay well maybe there's
some stuff to that okay let's have an open conversation about it but they don't have an
open conversation they give you fake formulas that you you can't even they just make formulas up
up they fabricate the measurements of temperature that they get in some of these locations
but why am i even talking about that all you have to do see this is the craziest thing
they they they virtue signal and they tug at the heartstrings of these poor soul-sucked humans
that fall for fake news and they say trump doesn't care about the planet earth republicans don't
care about earth can you believe that that is the most evil thing ever they don't even care about
the planet they'll kill us all and you say well okay well who do you trust well al gore has been
calling on well wait a second let's go back and let's look at al gore's documentary an
inconvenient truth from just over 10 years ago everything he said is wrong everything he said
is wrong and they still give him a platform they still give him a podium and he still flops his
gums telling you we need to do something about global warming oh but oh but now they ratchet it back
it's not global warming now it's climate change it's climate change well yeah so oh climate change
deniers no we were the ones saying it was climate change while you said it was global warming so

from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
oh and shroy are filling in for alex today i've noticed an interesting trend in the last couple
of months and you may have noticed this too what happens is it's like honestly the whole russian
collusion thing is the best example of this but to be more specific the media reports on something
because of political biases and because they want to have a self-fulfilling prophecy so they report
on something over and over like the russian investigation or the russian collusion they
report on something over and over and over and then they think it's real and so now they've
they've basically planted a seed of lies in their own head that they water themselves with misinformation
and so what happens is they get confused and they don't understand what's going on because
nothing that's happening in reality is actually matching what they've built up in their own mind
because of the confusion that they've essentially instilled in themselves so in a in a smaller example
here is a the nb nbc broadcast where they're whining about being confused because they don't
understand the tax bill the new law limits property tax deduction to just ten thousand
dollars in 2018 but homeowners in high tax states and cities who prepay next year's bill before the
end of 2017 may save money may because it depends on a number of factors something accountant matt
meyer has had to explain to his chicago area clients in a deluge of panic phone calls it's
ridiculous tax season started a month or early you know usually in the month of december we're
going on vacation we're taking the easy work this year meyer and his team are spending their time
explaining the new law it means something different for absolutely every single person a tax bill
is supposed to simplify things and uh it really hasn't many taxpayers don't realize that the changes
won't be a factor in this year's returns they'll see the full impact come april 2019 and for anyone
looking to make those prepayments on property taxes they'll need to check in with the tax collector
in their hometowns in montclair the office will be open on saturday frank the takeaway is that if
you are confused you're actually not alone reach out to a professional get an accountant oh you're
confused if you don't have one have them look at your financial situation and give you some advice
and maybe steer clear of that advice at the holiday dinner table depends on your family but good
advice yeah you know if you're confused at how uh donald trump won the election i don't know why
i mean we just told you hillary was gonna win the whole time uh you know if you're confused why
trump hasn't been brought down for russian collusion even though we've been talking about it and
there's a special counsel here if you're confused well yeah i don't know why you're confused on that
it's just because we've been reporting it obviously it's true if you're confused by this tax bill
because trump is actually going to cut taxes then uh you know we we're confused too we don't understand
no this is they think that they can have a self-fulfilling prophecy by reporting on a story
that doesn't exist no matter what happens no matter whether it's positive or negative about trump
they put their spin on it and then it's never accurate so then their audience of course is
confused because they haven't told their audience anything that's real and then they're just saying
it's okay to be confused it's okay yeah they pat them on the head ah oh you're confused it's okay
we're confused too we don't understand it make america great again we don't get it either we
don't get it why would we want to make america great america being great we don't want that
now here's what's not going to be confusing this is when the daily caller today nearly
450 000 people fled these three deep blue states in 2017 folks there is about to be a tax refugee
scenario if you live in new york chicago or illinois i have a feeling that they are about to be
losing population because here's what's happened i don't understand i i honestly don't understand
someone that has a problem with what donald trump did for the state and local taxes except selfish
purposes which okay you want you don't want to you know you don't want to pay as much taxes i get it but
why should see this is a crime to me how is it that states like new york and illinois
and california get to wantonly spend and spend and spend and have sanctuary cities and have
massive welfare states so that they tax their people into oblivion so that they can port they
can you know bring in non-citizens and support them and so trump says look you have not been paying
your fair share of taxes and that's the truth if you lived in new york or illinois or california
or one of these states that has a huge state tax you haven't been paying your fair share
you have been getting a cut now you have to pay as much as the rest of us that's going to suck
and now maybe you're going to rethink those welfare states or you're just gonna move which is what
we're already seeing happening and it's going to happen again so yeah if you're in new york
and you had to pay 12 000 in state and local taxes you get to write that off of your federal
taxes and then you don't pay them well i'm sorry that's not fair why should i have to pay more
because you want to have a sanctuary city in california why should i have to pay more
because ron emmanuel wants to have a sanctuary city in chicago so i i just don't understand
and it's i mean i could name names here but big mainline conservatives are ticked about it
it's not my fault you move to california and live there it's not my fault that governor
moonbeam brown out there is just raising your tax he's not even there after time so what does he
care he didn't pay the taxes anyway so i'm expecting this number to grow 450 000 fled deep blue states
in 2017 i bet that i bet that number grows in 2018 and doesn't that just tell you what democrats
do to cities what democrats do to states they destroy them look at any inner city in this country
that has been run by democrats for multiple decades baltimore chicago st lewis name the city
in california what's happening they're all broke the inner cities are are infested with gangs and
violence and drugs and oh oh well you know we're gonna have gun laws in chicago well then how come
there's a shooting seemingly every week and i think there were five shootings over christmas day
weekend in chicago so if you want to know the real story here that you already knew democrats
destroy things they destroy economies they destroy cultures they destroy societies they
destroy the family they destroy race relations they destroy the school systems they destroy
everything that's why they have a d next to their name it's not democrat it's destroy and now they
want to destroy america now they want to destroy trump now they want to destroy a tax cut so i'm
expecting the tax refugees to maybe even approach close to a million in the year 2018 because these
people and they're probably clueless they don't have a clue in new york or california or illinois
how they're just getting bent over by their state for these taxes because they're paying for non-citizens
in sanctuary cities and welfare states oh oh you mean oh wait you mean now that you have to pay
for the sanctuary city you mean now that you have to pay for the non-citizen now that you
have to pay for the welfare state you don't like it now that you have to pay for it you don't like it
oh shocking i wonder who's felt that way

anything and everything they think they can a trump tack on attack trump on they will it doesn't
matter if it makes sense if it's a non-existent story they'll just go after trump because that's
how filled with hate and rage and lies they are and now you've got this msnbc i guess he's a sports
editor or commentator or something saying that trump is racist because of his comments on the
nfl here's that clip dave let me ask you really quickly about some of the uh the accusations
that the president's comments have had racial undertones to them when you think of some of the
msnbc just obsessed with race and many of them uh prominent people are obsessed with race that the
president has uh given he's he's categorically denied that this has anything to do without race
but just pause it for a second these people are so obsessed with race see they don't get it
most conservative i'm not saying race is written but but the average conservative
or let's just say trump let's just say donald trump when he looks at someone
he's not saying oh it's it's a black person or it's a hispanic person or it's a white person
he just sees a person these liberals these people on msnbc cnn these are the people obsessed with
race see the first thing they think is what color the skin is and then they immediately
make a hundred judgments based on that these are the real racists you want to tune into racist news
go to msnbc go back to the clip cited here uh in the article it seems that there is a racial
just race race race baiting a racist race obsessed over race race race race it's not a dog whistle
it's an air raid siren if you look at some of the people in the sports world who've actually been the
most critical of donald trump uh pause it right there pause right there oh oh you mean guys that
play with a ball for a living wow guys that dribble a basketball and throw a ball around a
yard i'm shocked that they aren't the most politically savvy people i mean wow i'm not insulting
athletes plenty of them are very very brilliant people i'm just saying it's like oh my gosh these
athletes you know they think this is about trump well no kidding they play with a ball all day long
go back popovich the coach of the spurs steve kerr the coach of the golden state warriors
pause right there i'm a hundred percent convinced that the only reason you're hearing these head
coaches say this is so that they can still be friends and and cater to their athletes i don't
know if they actually believe it go back from donald trump to either of them uh they happen to be
white the people who he has responded to again obsessed over race holland cavernick jamelle hill
from espn lavar these people are all anti-american this focusing there's nothing to do with race
that's what they don't get grateful people in the sports world who are black and i just want to
point out that this is a very old playbook in this country it dates back to jack johnson who
was condemned by the u.s congress he was the first black heavyweight boxing champion and this idea
that when you focus on black athletes that's what they're doing white resentment because there's
anger about whether it's their salary their fame or this idea that you know they should be grateful
for having these opportunities as if they haven't worked for them and pause it real quick yeah that's
right uh that's right bud because i'm sure these basketball players could go make tens of millions
of dollars in any other country no yeah i'm sure all of these football players could go make tens
of millions in dollars in any other no no so the only place where they could actually do what they do
and make money is america oh but america is the problem and it's a race issue and and they
they should feel entitled to just get all the praise in the world uh why wouldn't you be grateful
that you get three million people a year if you're an athlete and you're a baseball player you get
three million people a year to come out and watch you yeah i would be grateful that i'm grateful
for our audience and go back to this troll and you know a million people who would have the skill
and ability to achieve that plateau and we can actually build upon the history of previous generations
of activist athletes to understand not only how to keep pushing forward sports as a platform for
social change but also keep pushing forward um the the very idea that you don't sign away you know
you're positive change or to have a political opinion uh just to be organic as well as how
it's not organic now it's all forced it's all force fed it's all based on lies you know it's
all manipulated by soros and and linda cockroach sarsore i mean it's just such a joke now
so he mentions in there he's like oh well this is obviously a racial thing because most players
in the NFL are black most players in the NBA are black well then i'm sorry then as a white person
i i think they have black privilege 90 of those leagues are black well must be black privilege
no it's because they're better athletes we don't obsess over skin color here that's msnbc
and again you know these let me just tell you something people don't know i came from
from sports media now if you here's the thing and i'll actually give lavar ball a little credit
for something even though he's he was very disrespectful and unappreciative of what president
trump did i'll give him credit for something if you want to do something about one of the biggest
crimes probably in the history of sports that is universities taking advantage of black students
it's time to shut down the ncaa do you realize that the ncaa makes billions and billions of
dollars every year and doesn't pay their athletes a dime do you realize that probably i don't know
the number but i would say at least 80 percent of ncaa uh rosters for basketball are probably
african-american males they don't get paid where's the outcry mark emerton the ncaa make billions
of dollars hand over fist every year what do the athletes get nada zip zilch well where's the call
for something to be done about that where's the racism there how about the ncaa you want to talk
about being racist how racist is the ncaa basketball let me tell you something the reason why the ncaa
is so dirty i mean you could you could read on for days about scandals in the ncaa made up classes
kids faking classes kids getting cars kids getting payouts they can't even sell a a headband they
wore during the game and that's illegal but the university is allowed to make millions of dollars
off of their labor nothing on that though don't call out the ncaa for taking advantage of black
people no it's only trump and then you had this story which doesn't surprise me nfl ratings down
again over christmas weekend and now they're getting beat by the nba that's something that you
never see but the one thing about the nba over christmas is the nba used to go like all out for
christmas they'd wear christmas jerseys they'd all be in christmas colors it'd be a huge thing for
christmas well for some reason this christmas the nba decided to just act like it wasn't about
christmas so i don't know if there's anything to that but i'm just wondering when the msnbc sports
editor is going to call out the ncaa for taking advantage of african-american athletes and fleecing
them for billions of dollars i'm just curious if msnbc will ever do that let's squeeze in jason
here before we go to a break jason in florida calling in go ahead jason
we'll get jason i know he's there go ahead jason how are you guys doing today i'm doing all right
i'm just wondering if msnbc is going to uh do something about the taking advantage the ncaa
taking advantage of black black athletes i'm just curious if they're gonna say anything
probably not because you know at the end of the day they get uh you know probably a hundred
thousand dollars oh that's right oh that's right you're right the nbc affiliate the nbc major
network profits off the ncaa good point but uh you know you you guys you know i got no problem
with you guys you know i kind of i try to walk the middle of the line here uh i like stuff from
the right and from the left you know i think that's kind of where we all need to migrate to is you
know there's good stuff from both sides yeah just you know look at look at information and
find out you know where your thoughts line what's real sure sure absolutely absolutely i agree with
you a hundred percent but uh you know in my mind you guys are kind of doing the same thing that
these other guys do you're out here bashing the next network you know you're promoting your agenda
i'm not saying that you're right or wrong or they're right or wrong by any means but it's the same
you know what i'm glad that you said that i'm glad that you said that jason i had a bunch of friends
over christmas that were shocked they were like oh and you've become such an angry hateful person
since you began working for info wars i'm like no i'm not i'm the same happy go lucky cheery guy i mean
anybody who's met me knows i'm i'm very happy i'm easy to go along with i'm not angry and mad
but here's the difference jason because you're you're actually hitting something here i get mad
when people attack the things that i love so when they want to abort children when they want to when
they want to try to divide this country on lies yeah then i get a little mad so when msnbc is
sitting here race baiting to try to incite a civil war yeah i get a little ticked off about that i
mean what that's a natural reaction climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by info

you're listening to the alex jones show
well just when you thought california couldn't get more baddie they just had to raise the bar
or i guess lower it so now lgbt q r s w y w t f 109er is history is now mandatory in california
and you cannot opt there you cannot opt your child out of it uh here's them breaking it down on fox
news historians now wrestling with how to teach lgbt history to school children as california
becomes the first date to use lgbt left out like 74 different sexual variations sir with this story
william racist fox and rick it's controversial because some publishers were not comfortable
identifying people as gay they did not help themselves or the conclusion lacked evidence
and said oh my gosh these people i just honestly for i i don't even know how to deal with these
people anymore i don't know if there's any hope for them they are so obsessed with their agenda
they are so obsessed with their identity politics that they're sitting here just looking at people
like well maybe he was gay so let's say he was gay and put him in the history class maybe she was gay
but well yeah okay let's say she was gay let's they're just now they are deciding what your sexual
orientation is all right finish the clip parents cannot opt out oh my welcome to elementary school
we're in california elementary school requires a fair accurate inclusive and respectful treatment
of lesbian gay by entrance how many kids just pause it how many kids in elementary school think that
they're gay now how many will go back to the clip i think what's going on here i is um um an effort
to uh politicize history we're not what we're not saying there's an agenda we're not saying that
these people are better than other people what we're saying is this is another group of americans
and they face certain prejudices this state required publishers like mark jared to include
the sexual preferences of prominent historical figures among others activists jane adams writers
emily dickinson and nathaniel hawthorne and people are all dead james buccannon though evidence is
inconclusive yeah we should say buccannon he never married he had a very good friend he's gay
he may have been gay on the other hand he may have been gay so let's say he's gay what is this
uh seen as something evil and wrong the state approved jared's text how many of these people
do you think are closet homosexuals coach driver charlie parker's as a woman who i did
his problem was driving this barren von stuben who helped washington at valley forge may have been
gay point wall whitman was running young men in parks and dance halls but denied his same sex
preferences in public much of this is speculation good line it's uh yeah must have though most of
this is speculation so let's make sure that this is mandatory in elementary school i mean folks this
is out of control lesbian astronaut sally ride yeah maybe he was gay how i mean seriously what are
you how do you cover this how do you cover something so insane that there's not even a foundation
there's not even a basis so we're going to be now in california forcing children in elementary
school to take lgbtq wtf9 or history but think about it first of all i don't even think i don't
even think black history is is uh is forced to be taught in elementary maybe it is maybe it isn't
but imagine imagine if someone floated the notion out there that we should make it mandatory for
children in high school to learn about white history shut it down shut it down racist racist
how dare you all right but let's get the lgbt history month in there and let's plug a bunch of
names in there well do you know they're gay no oh okay so i guess uh boy from the madness in california
to the madness in new york bill de Blasio likens himself to thomas edison henry ford and mahatma
ghandi and so now thomas edison henry ford and mahatma ghandi are spinning in their graves
probably trying to rip they're probably trying to rip their way out of the coffin right now just
to strangle de Blasio you know i don't know how de Blasio wins an election this guy is such a fop
i mean i guess just you know they flood these inner cities with people that are on welfare
tell them to vote the democrat so they can get their welfare they flood them with the immigrants
they tell them keep voting democrat so we can keep chain migration going i think that's how
they win of course we already know about the voter blocks they bring in with their open borders
and immigration policy but de Blasio so now it basically de Blasio is getting attacked from the
left and he says well you know all of these people that doubt me and my progressive policies need to
look at all the struggles that thomas edison and henry ford and mahatma ghandi had oh oh i remember
when mahatma ghandi had a uh had a staffer get arrested for for thousands and thousands of
child pornography documents on his computer that oh no no that didn't happen to ghandi
now that was de Blasio well i remember when thomas edison marched in the streets of new york
with i think his name was oscar revera uh a terrorist a known terrorist arrested charged
terrorist that was that was thomas edison that marched in the streets with the terrorist right
oh no no no oh that was de Blasio too wait a second henry ford though henry ford was the
mayor of new york city when there was like 10 terrorist attacks so that was henry oh no no
no that that was de Blasio too wow and then he gets reelected yeah i mean what's crazier new
york or california uh let's go to john who's calling in from california my goodness john
uh be sure to sign up for your lgbtq class because it's mandatory now what's up john
do we have john
guys is john there or okay let's go to mckinsey in south carolina
now you're you're actually called in about this subject talking about um
disinfo from teachers propaganda it's actually shocking what teachers will do in these classes
with their bias and then pretend that it's it's centered uh go ahead mckinsey
yeah i'm a senior right now and i've been reading all about the whole senior let's
clarify high school or college high school sorry yeah i'm reading about what i'm probably
going to end up going in the head i'm a black person i'm a lot of people are racist i don't
want that that takes me look bad i don't want to be associated with that people don't want to
be associated with that's just like what do you do with your teacher teaches you one thing and the
reality is a whole different thing all together well there was a kid in new york who had a teacher
that basically did a whole lesson on white privilege and how black people are oppressed
this individual happened to be uh of hispanic descent and the individual just stood up and was
like uh excuse me no and then cited the numbers like look at the fbi statistics on crime look at
the fbi statistics on police encounters with black and white people size statistics completely
buries the white privilege or or the you know blacks are the only ones that have it bad with
police and says look you know police incidents happen against all races all colors you know this
isn't a racist thing and then what did the teacher do kicked him out of class what did the school do
suspended him you can't make this stuff up you literally cannot deny the teacher what the teacher
says they're also gonna get kicked out even if the teacher's lying to you they're gonna say the fbi
state news next that's what they're gonna say i mean what are you saying as a high school senior
i mean is it is it is it as bad at your school i mean i live in the deep south i mean my school
i live just even the most liberal part in columbia it's not as bad as it would be in like california
but it's still have you know teachers who like literal literal anti-fuzz reporters like we have
a teacher publicans club and one of the teachers had her kid like hit one of the members with a
paper balloon during a halloween party you know it's like go hit the republic and they're like
what in the world is this well yeah and what do you expect i honestly i didn't experience this until
i got into college but i didn't really realize it at the time but when you look back you realize it
it what what is going to happen to these kids that go into college specifically white people but
black people as well when you have a teacher a white teacher that is filled with so much white
guilt she hates herself he hates himself so then they project that onto the rest of the class and
the weak minded fall for it and so then you have all these white people that feel like they're
privileged and they're and they've been oppressing black people so now they're crazy and then you
have the black people that feel like oh it's the white man's fault and everything that happens is
the white man's fault so then they never want to do something to succeed for themselves because
they've been victimized so it's it's it's a 360 rotation here and it's literally all liberal
indoctrination it's all the victim mindset it's all about i'm a victim i've got it bad so now you
have to be a victim and then if we're all victims and we all have it bad well then we'll all just
sit here and just play in our misery i mean misery loves company after all

you're listening to the alex jones show
you want answers well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
trumps been any year and this is a fair time to average all the stuff he did
as president elect with when he officially became president he's not god he can't get it all done
i'm surprised how much he's gotten done it's been miraculous and they said he'd never get the tax
cuts through on and on and on and they played all the race games you know there's new statistics out
and it's not that hispanics that make up something like 70 percent of of uh immigrants come to the
country are inherently criminal it's that there is a contingent already fleeing justice like americans
flee to mexico and vice versa that don't have real names have fake ids that the mexican consulate
will give them all these corrupt state governments and local governments will give them ids and they
are just above the law and they mainly feed if you look at the statistics on other hispanics
Mexico gets illegal aliens from latin america and gives them six months to your hard labor
and tortures them that's the one in guardian and i'm not defending that the point is acting
like america is the worst thing on earth is not true and then the democrats try to
turn hispanics particularly into a new racial group and make it race-based politics and that's
failing and that's good news for everybody so Jorge Ramos says he's now having the worst time
of his life in the u.s with donald trump there i have never been treated so badly i've never been
insulted so much we've never been attacked so much they've never tried to run us out as much as now
ramos vented in an interview with the spanish radio network ramos who proclaimed himself
is not the enemy but an opponent of trump in the interview complained about the massive blowback
he's received since deciding to use his media platform to openly oppose the choice over 62
million americans who voted last year's election then he complains about social networks the social
networks are 10 to 1 against libertarians nationalists and conservatives but we know most of them
are bots we know it's fake so we don't care if we get ridiculed we keep hammering back but
everybody knows the democrats the globalists the liberals are way more threatening way more hateful
constantly calling for violence and then when kate stanley gets shot in the back and the virtue
signaling mainly white jury lets the guy who'd been deported what five times and committed all
these crimes lets him go not even manslaughter not even accidental because they couldn't signal
that it was wrong to shoot her in the back what about kate well signs were put up at the university
there in san francisco and folks pulled them down and said this is racist all it said was she had
dreams too like she's a human too she has rights too but then nancy polosi virtue signals and says
illegal migrants embody the best of our nation not migrants not not not people coming here to work
not people coming here to be americans but migrants which means illegals and then she goes on to say
they embody the best of our nation's patriotism hard work persevering polosi said the dreamers
she added that congress shouldn't leave them to celebrate the holidays and fear oh really what
about kate stanley meanwhile so it was terrorism attacker who rammed his car into victims upset at
mistreatment of muslims and of course you've had hundreds of these attacks the last few years in
russia europe here all over and most of the time they'll never even say it's his lamasist in fact
in sweden and in other areas they won't release the name they've passed laws and regulations
saying it's racist if the guy's name is habip or hamam and or op-med or whatever it's just incredible
so we had a call or call in earlier and and the caller made a fair point like you know in in some
instances i feel like maybe you kind of do the same thing that the mainstream media does attacking
your opponents but what am i supposed to do see when horre ramos what i mean what an absolute
lying fraud horre ramos is to sit here and be like oh i've got it so bad now because bullcrap
you're still making millions of dollars you but but what does he do he says it's been harder for us
because of trump now it's been harder for us he's virtue signaling to hispanic and latino people like
trump hates you america hates you now because of trump that is an absolute lie so yes i get mad
when horre ramos consciously lies to people to try to tear this country down yeah i get a little

so james wesley-rawls joins me now survivalblog.com uh james let's start with some financial stuff
bitcoin peaked right at about 20 000 it goes back down uh gold was going down the entire time now
gold is backed up what do you see as a smart investment right now for someone looking to
invest do you think precious metals do you think bitcoin what do you think well i'm definitely
an advocate of precious metals and in particular silver and for anyone who's considering gold
i'm actually leaning more toward platinum right now presently gold is around what 1275 an ounce
platinum is down to 940 an ounce and traditionally platinum has sold at a premium above the price
of gold now it's selling at a discount to gold so logic dictates that if it's going to return to
its historic norms which i think it will that the wise place to put your money is platinum not gold
interesting yeah so so that's a safe investment you think because the way platinum normally goes
it would be a safe investment right now absolutely uh and but in general though i'm more of a
proponent of silver than i am either gold or any of the metals in the platinum group and
the reason being i'm a prepper and i'm geared toward uh barter in a financial wipeout situation
and there silver would be much much much more practical for barter than gold gold is simply
too compact a form of wealth for practical barter i guess you could do it with a cold chisel
that it's not very pretty it's better to have silver small silver coins that are much more
practical for day-to-day purchases now shifting to bitcoin obviously it saw a huge boom and it's
kind of come back down to earth you know the only thing that's kind of confusing to me about bitcoin
is how practical really is it right now and how practical would it be say a situation breaks
out where you have to go into survival mode well it wouldn't be practical at all in survival mode
because if you don't have access to the internet you don't have access to bitcoin but uh there
is some utility in bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies and i i think that it is
wise for people to at least take a small hedge position into the cryptos and uh but people
just have to do that with both eyes open not get emotional about it and be ready to sell or buy
at the drop of a hat now watch the markets closely it's definitely not a market for someone
who is faint of heart because we're going to see some huge swings in bitcoin but i think that in
another couple of years we may see bitcoin over $50,000 what about other cryptocurrencies out there
why is bitcoin seen to be the one that's taking off the most what do you have any faith in any
other cryptocurrencies i think ethereum is quite good and salt for example there's a lot of good
ones out there they all use the same essentially the same bitcoin blockchain technology and they
all have comparable levels of security bitcoin is the most popular simply because it was there
first it doesn't have any real technological superiority to any of the others and of course
there's no intrinsic value in any of them so they're all highly speculative but they do
make a good little hedge and um i think the thing to do is to watch the market very carefully
take a small position in either bitcoin or ethereum watch them very carefully
and then watch for news about the other cryptocurrencies and then on a day when
either bitcoin or ethereum are quite high you can shift some of your holdings from bitcoin
to one of the lesser known cryptos immediately following news of a minor panic within that
crypto say for example there's news that the you know the ceo of whatever cryptocurrency
corporation has been indicted or that someone or the ceo has committed suicide or or that
and shockingly that type of news comes down the pipeline about once a month actually yeah it does
so just watch very carefully and as bitcoin stair steps upward be ready to diversify out
into the other cryptos but do it on a day when bitcoin is high and the and the currency the
crypto that you want to move it into is relatively low especially following bad news and with some
of the other cryptos the swings in in market valuation for those coins are even wider than
with bitcoin so you can take advantage of some short-term bad news say for example the securities
and exchange commission or the IRS says they're going to crack down on whatever currency that
that crypto might plummet 50 60 70 percent in one day that's the day to buy in and diversify
out of bitcoin in the long-term your portfolio cryptos should be spread over at least three
crypto currencies preferably four or five and as a long-term hedge I think that's the safe place
to be it used to be you would only hear about cryptocurrencies or bitcoin on alternative news
you know here at info wars yourself or Gerald Salente or other people's you know blogs and
stuff talking about bitcoin but now for the first time I've ever seen I mean a day doesn't go by
where some mainstream news network isn't talking about bitcoin should you buy should you sell
what type of impact do you think now that it's entered the fold of mainstream news what type
of impact do you think that has on bitcoin I think it's going to make things even more volatile
and in the long term though the number of people in the world who have access to a smart phone
versus the number who have taken a hedge position in bitcoin is minuscule so I think in the long
term the cryptos are going to do fairly well but there's a number of factors that could make any of
them completely wiped out overnight all right that's James Wesley Rawls survival blog dot com
we talked some bitcoin in the next segment we're gonna talk some geopolitics heart disease is on

i'll enjoy your filling in for alex today
my guest is james wesley-rolls we were just talking bitcoin and precious metals
we're about to discuss some geopolitics but first he wanted to finish a couple key points on bitcoin
go ahead james the floor is yours thanks oh and i just wanted to stress that there's a lot of risks
with any of the bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies you know we're in a situation
where there's a kind of a rising tide of interest in the cryptos and the old saying in the financial
markets is a rising tide lifts all ships and that will i think be true of the cryptocurrencies
but just keep in mind that there's a lot of risk there never have more than five or ten percent
of of your net worth in cryptos and that's even someone who's watches the market very closely
for anyone else i wouldn't suggest more than one or two percent of their net worth and keep
in mind that we live in a society that's driven by envy and as the cryptocurrencies take off
as i think they will in the next couple of years i think we're going to see a lot of hacker interest
in the cryptos because these are going to be people who feel like they they missed out
and they're going to be envious and they're going to want to steal from others
and they're mainly i think going to go after the the crypto exchanges rather than currencies
themselves but i think there will also be concerted attacks on individual accounts
in attempts to recover passwords so people should be very very careful about the passwords they use
or past phrases they use and where they keep those past phrases it's also very important
to keep redundant copies of your bitcoin wallet but keep very close track of where those are physically
and ideally your laptop that you use for trading bitcoin should be a spare laptop that you only
connect to the internet very infrequently just for bitcoin trading otherwise that machine
that device is kept offline to minimize the vulnerability to hackers
and go ahead no i was just going to say so that's the expert's take on bitcoin and make sure if
you're going to invest you do it wisely as to not put yourself in a hole should anything bad happen
James i want to move into some geopolitics now you know there's so much there's so much craziness
going on you've got north japanese newspapers reporting north korea kim jong-un is trying
to put anthrax on a warhead you've got this story came out of fox there's a war coming
marine corps general warns us troops you've got russia accusing the united states of training
former ices fighters in syria to me that has john mccain's earmarks all over it he he he admitted
to doing that and then you have the u.s coalition saying less than a thousand ices fighters left
in iraq and syria so there seems to be positive movements but then there also seems to be
negative movements in the geopolitics of course you have israel and palestine fighting after
trump said jerusalem was a capital just like they were before trump said that but somehow it's
trumps fault but but i'm just curious with with all of the developments in specifically syria
and then russia united states and ukraine where do you see this going right now because you know
if you think that russia and the united states are colluding well then why is the united states
arming ukraine and why would the united states or members of the deep state here be trying to get
ices fighters back a foothold in syria yeah i i do think that syria is really the wild card out
there even more so than north korea there is a huge risk of syria the syrian civil war spinning
out of control and becoming a regional war or even a world war and the reason being is that
everyone's attention up till now has primarily been upon ices and the ices surrogates now that ices
is largely out of the picture i think that the syrian regime is going to focus its attention
on other dissidents inside of syria including the Kurds and once they start committing themselves
in the Kurdistan region i think there's huge potential for this to get out of control and
whether it involves you know russian and american aircraft for example or or incursions into into
into turkey into iraq there could be all sorts of things that spin out of control here that are
very difficult to predict and the ramifications of those could be enormous yeah i tend to agree
with you where i think the the real wild card here is syria and not necessarily north korea i mean
to me it's kind of widely known north korea is a cancer communism has failed there now what
relationship china has with north korea and how china uses north korea that's a totally different
story but you know you take care of north korea i don't know how much of a blowback you necessarily
get but you start trying to intervene in syria now russian is going to be pissed now russia is
going to try to ally ally with china and then of course you've got the oil pipeline that they're
trying to get through there too so that'll just tick off the world even more united states oil wars
but what is the positive i mean syria is more independent now than they've ever been christians
are allowed to celebrate christmas and walk around the streets and praise jesus without
getting slaughtered by isis now i mean who is it that try who i mean honestly is it the deep
state is the united states doing something again that we didn't want them to do expanding war in
syria under the covers but but i mean who is this that is trying to stop syria from being independent
well yeah it's one of those qui bono kind of questions and it's really it's difficult to say
what the who the real players really are and what the long-term strategy is but even in the short
term there's there's tremendous risk and a lot of unpredictability so it's wise for folks to plan on
a possibly a regional war developing in the middle east and planning accordingly i think that we
could if that were to happen we would see gas prices spike up over four dollars a gallon
so from a practical standpoint as a prepper my advice is if you live in the country and by
code you can legally install a fuel storage tank put in a big diesel tank and if you if you use
propane to heat your home replace that tank with a much larger tank perhaps a two or even three
thousand gallon tank because the price swings in the liquid fuels could be huge that's the practical
side of it on the political side of it it's uh it's very funny that uh that the liberal mass media
is still trying to point finger fingers at the trump administration and claim collusion with
the russians where whereas uh as the Mueller investigation goes on there's more and more
evidence that the real collusion actually was between the clinton's and russia yeah i mean
that's been totally blown out of the water you can't put that genie back in the bottle but but real
quick final 30 seconds here it is kim is kim jung-un really crazy enough to try to put anthrax on
the head of a warhead or is that just the japanese press kind of freaking out right now now i think
that may be more posturing than anything else what i'm really worried about is not kim jung-un's
nuclear delivery means by missile but rather him simply putting a traditional fishing bomb inside
a connex and delivering it to a major seaport like long beach harbor oh yeah i mean let's not forget
under obama we had open borders for eight years who knows who could have snuck in a sneak a suitcase
bomb thanks to president obama that's james wesley roll survival blog dot com thank you so much james

you're listening to the alex jones show
he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
jones well it doesn't matter that the united states is in a way squaring off with russia
right now funding ukraine and then perhaps you have the stories about new isis fighters or or
similar type fighters in syria with us backing should ask john mccain about that he brags about it
yet the russian probe is ongoing and while nothing has actually landed on trump
the left continues to obsess over mewler and manifold as this story robert mewler may indict
paul manifold again okay well a lot of openness about that headline to say the least but again
the cat is already out of the bag and they can't put it back in mewler probe outgrows its witch hunt
phase well it was never just a witch hunt it was a get rid of trump hunt that was the whole purpose
take trump down and by the way betsey woodruff you know she's actually not one of the worst she
goes on msnbc every once while writes for the daily beast she's kind of level headed but she buys the
whole russian inclusion thing so i kind of feel bad for because that's why she kind of uh writes
these stories then the daily mail says trump tears into garbage golden showers dossier
don't just don't not do not forget about this i'm telling you donald trump is still ticked off
about this fake dossier and while every cat and all the genies are getting let out of the bottle
from mewler's end of things with rozenstein with peter stroke with bruce or and nelly or i mean we
found it i'm telling you it's good that you can't put the genie back in the bottle this was a story
from world net daily did the fbi conspire to stop trump and now they put it as a question uh here
give me give me the dot cam guys i'm gonna fix this headline for them actually we're gonna go ahead
and just cross did out and then cross the question mark out all right new headline the fbi conspired
to stop trump that's not a conspiracy theory that is a conspiracy fact i mean do i really have to
sit here and break this down again it's like peter stroke and james comey let hillary clinton off
for her crimes then you have peter stroke saying just in case trump wins we need to have an insurance
plan well what is he saying he's saying they think they're bigger than the election he's
saying in case trump wins we have to get him out of office and in the meantime we're gonna spy on
trump and his team to look for dirt we're gonna make up a fake dossier so that we can spy on them
then using that we're gonna say he was colluding with russia to try to delegitimize his presidency
and where did all of that nonsense originate the fbi obama's doj and hillary clinton herself
so it's not did the fbi conspire to stop trump it's we already know we have it the fbi conspired
to stop trump we already know hillary clinton rigged the democrat primary so she could beat
bernie sanders you don't think she tried to rig the election too of course she did this is one of
the most wanton criminals in the history of the world hillary clinton and she has so much dirt
in her closet and all of her cronies are so deep and deeply embedded in criminal behavior
they had to get her in so that they don't end up going to jail because that's where they're all
gonna end up that's where they're all gonna end up and the cats are to the back out of the bag we
have the names we know what they did we know how comey and stroke worked together to get hillary off
we then know how hillary funded the the fake dossier that got moved about we now know how the
doj with bruce or was communicating with obama this entire time and that nelly or was communicating
with god knows who over a ham radio peter stroke says we have to have an insurance policy so now
you're seeing more of this g.o.p representative calls for purge of deep state cronies within the
fbi well again i'm fully expecting this to happen before long but it's pretty easy you you sit down
peter stroke for a hearing a testimony you do it in public you grill him and you make him sing like
a bird and then if he doesn't sing and he doesn't want to cooperate well you've got a whole investigation
going into trump colluding with russia where there's nothing i think at that time you open up an
investigation into peter stroke and how he was colluding to having quote unquote insurance policy
in case trump won there's your investigation can't wait for that to happen and i get the feeling
it's uh it's gonna happen all right let's go back out to the phone lines let's start with matthew
calling in from mrs sippy go ahead matthew hey oh and how you doing buddy good i got a couple things
i'll appreciate you taking my call you i've talked to you a couple times the deep state is in panic
mode i want to go over a couple things are you familiar with the gentleman by the name of codie
stodgers the xcia blackoff operator that's come on the common sense show he went on the rent show
youtube channels of course he was just on the another youtube channel the other day
he is exposed to deep state like no other actually the event that happened at cuba
is now happening in the united states donald rumpfield uh is now being looked at with the
911 event so it's not just on the left buddy you're gonna have deep state names being exposed
when these indictments surface and they're even talking now about election fraud
with the hillary clinton debacle in the q post well here's what it comes down to here's what it comes
down to they can indict and arrest hillary and peter stroke probably or probably even obama
they could arrest all of them right now they already have the evidence they already know
what they did they could arrest all of them right now why aren't they doing it that's a different
question go ahead i got one more thing and i know you got other collars this is if you go on my youtube
channel which is truth not fiction matters i just did an interview with the bill pierce
with the america first media group they are currently looking into the seth rich murder
okay i really want you to watch that video oh and then email me and give me your opinion
but the deep state is in deep trouble believe me and that gentleman that's called in and talked to
mr alex jones i'd really like to talk to him that guy is dead on mr zack that's in morocco
and i really think you guys need to get cody snodgrass now he was just involved everybody
should know this he was just involved involved in a head-on collision and there's a bunch of
information coming out that it was an intentional trying to take this gentleman out and that you
know that's a key thing too because you know we talk about the deep state and we know what
that is that's people embedded inside the government in very high-powered positions
in certain bureaucracies where they're either blackmailed or they're working together with
some sort of criminal conspiracy but we we sometimes forget that there's actually good people
that are in these bureaucracies too there's actually good people that are in the fbi and
the doj that don't want to see this happen that are calling it out and again we the cat is already
out of the bag they're still looking up every corner for some russian collusion that never
existed we literally have the entire story about how hillary clinton tried to steal the
election from bernie sanders and how hillary clinton tried to steal the election from donald
trump we got the whole thing we got the emails we got the text messages we got even they write
books about seth rich you know so we already know it so what so you have to ask yourself
what are they waiting for what is sessions waiting for what is president trump waiting for
are they waiting for something do they think they can hook something else with a little bit of bait
do they think they can get a bigger fish because again we already know bruce or nancy or peter
stroke james combi barack obama hillary clinton we know what y'all did you couldn't let trump get
in because hillary clinton was the final hammer to put the nails in the coffin of america and
then trump got in and he's pried the coffin open we're climbing out we're back you deserve a deep

at infowar store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show radio has changed our lives
and got to be changed our lives you gotta keep them separated
we now take you live to the central texas commence center and the heart of the resistance
welcome back to the alex jones show oh and shroyer filling in today knock out some news here
and then i'll take a couple more calls this is from the new york times paul krugman writes america
is not yet lost now the funny thing is this story would have made sense a year ago but paul krugman
decides to write it a year too late and says many of us came into 2017 expecting the worst and in many
ways the worst is what we got he's right you know it was the worst stock market ever it was the worst
unemployment numbers ever it was the worst for people uh going on welfare it was the worst for
the housing market it was the worst for christmas sales it was the worst for tax cuts wait wait a
second it was the best for all those things huh funny but isn't it amazing the new york times
publishes a story that is the polar opposite of reality so you're right america is not yet lost
you should have written this december 25th 2016 after obama tried to kill america and now in 2017
trump has actually made the best things and then paul krugman says it's actually the worst
so that's just you know a little illustration of a liberal mind or the new york times that
doesn't want you to even have a clue i mean they want you so stupid that you're so confused when
you may wake up in the morning that you take anything they tell you as fact uh you know this
was just an interesting story that caught my attention 2017 a year of disaster there actually
were a lot of floods a lot of hurricanes and apparently a record number of damages so
is that a sign of you know climate change or is that a sign of something else perhaps
a non-human element u.s police remove white nationalist memorial from four shot australian
women so see this is what they do now this is what they did to kate steinle where if you're white
you're just a white nationalist if you're white you can't have a memorial you can't have a march
because you're a white nationalist why can't someone just be a person so they do it in america
kate steinle's march antiva shows up protests with guns they have a memorial in california
the authorities remove the memorial and then they protest their memorial and then they throw away
pictures of kate steinle now compare that to what you get for mike brown or trevon martin
and there's the rift right there and why does that rift exist because that's what cnn and msnbc
and barack obama want they want the rift so that they can divide and then demonize all i mean anyone
who just thinks for themselves it doesn't matter if you're black or white or asian or hispanic if
you think for yourself in fact now if you think for yourself you're a bigot and a white nationalist
even if you're black seriously you think i'm making that up look at what black conservatives say
and then look at what liberals say they say that they're white nationalists now so black
people are now white nationalists according to liberals uh yeah just like uh new york time says
2017 was the worst even though it was the best e you planning on olympic team to weaken national
pride well you're not a country e you so i'm not sure how that's going to happen but the olympics
you know they'll probably cater to that liberal ideology now i found this a little bit ironic
and i'm gonna go to your phone calls we already knew this was going on but the story is back in the
news apple faces lawsuits after saying it slows down aging iphones so just any end user could have
already told you that that was going on it was always a theory now they've admitted it but this
is so funny the liberal a modern day liberal will protest anything and everything but oh especially
if it's a big corporation i mean did you see the tax cuts the big corporations are getting
oh how dare they the big corporations are the bad guy they're trying to screw us over and then
here's a story of the big guy apple literally screwing over its users where's the liberal outrage
where are the protests totally silent you know why because cnn and msnbc and barack obama aren't
virtue signaling them into protesting but soon they'll probably virtue signal them in protesting
like another women's march or something so an actual example of the big business that liberals
hate screwing over the end user silence a fake news story about a woman that groped someone or
got groped 40 years ago millions of people march that's how the brainwashing works that's how the
fake news media works and that's how congruently a class of people is totally dilapidated mentally
goes out into the streets to march for a cause that doesn't even exist and you say hey what are you
out here uh screw you nazi oh very intellectual let's go to rick calling in from minnesota
go ahead rick you're on the air how's it going it's going good um you're kind of talking about
a subject i'm near and dear to my heart uh especially over the holidays kind of brother in
lost season or in my case brother season um where you just kind of battle or or more
else just keep your mouth shut because it's just idiotic yeah yeah they love they're so loving
and open-minded that you need to shut your mouth because you have a different opinion yeah yeah and
he's straight from the heart of it he's san diego so you know he knows all but uh one of the things
that i find when i do actually engage people whether it be facebook or whatever is is they're
talking about uh they don't want to believe any of the any truth that exists out there and they'll
believe anything that they hear like you're just saying they're brainwashed um and i'm always looking
for examples where i can uh kind of put it in their face and have them just dump on it their
mouth drops open one of the things i saw recently um and i made a comment about and you might have
covered this and if you have i'm sorry for repeating it but um it had to do with obama care
and how uh trump being in office i think he's just going to inadvertently cause a lot of good
things to happen and in this case well he intentionally he intentionally cut the mandate
now so if you don't get obama care you don't have to pay the penalty so that's going to open up an
entirely new marketplace exactly i mean anybody has any common sense can see it but uh liberal
brainwashing it's magical but uh so he's you know in his in his uh other wisdom or are accidental
because i'm not sure he's a big fan of uh obama care um but uh in just handling it like a business
man he managed to get it done in half the time and the advertising was see but that's see that's
exactly it though you just hit it on the head where we don't even need to like pontificate on
on issues you just hit on the head trump is a successful businessman and he looks at how he
became a success and he says the free market and capitalism so he says i want to instill that
in america because that was successful to me and that's what made america successful and you look
at the other side of the coin you look at obama well what has obama done in the private sector
next to nothing he's a nothing he's a nothing he's a community organizer so trump private sector
businessman massively successful by his own efforts says i want this to be for america obama
a nothing accomplishes nothing works for the government a complete flop says well i never
did anything to earn any money via my by my own efforts so so that's how i want america to be
i want everybody to do nothing and then just have the government give them money so i mean
that's what i'm saying though which one works which one doesn't the same one that's worked
throughout human history capitalism shocking oh my gosh capitalism beats socialism every time
i wish someone would have like had a history book or something on communism it's crazy
yeah you covered so many different subjects i was like god where do i start because that's
the one i wanted to talk about but it's like you went education and you went all over the place
and you're talking about taxes and how you know what on your ramp about how um all these states with
huge uh state taxes get to write it off and we all get to foot the bill and i i kind of came up
with a panacea too i think we could solve a lot of the problems but you got other colors and so
well yeah thank you so much for the call rick in minnesota i mean again i just don't understand
i mean if you're the one getting destroyed financially by state taxes and you're the
one that hasn't been paying your fair share why is that my fault i had to pay my full state taxes
you you didn't so i mean that's ridiculous steve you got 30 seconds uh close out this hour go ahead
steve uh i just want to say about you and the holidays and they've seen you was angry and all
that uh i think of watching your platform for years you're an alex and the work that you all
have done and pointing out to evil with the petafires and the deep state and everybody just
want to destroy the faith in god and the family the nation and the world just take a big deep
breath when you get angry and upset because once you get there i think god's going to be very pleased
with the battle that you all raised well and i'll tell you what steve hits it right on the head there
i mean aside from the politics god is back in america president trump has invoked jesus christ
back in the white house we have developed with the top firms the united states powerful 50 billion
live organism probiotic floral life that is so critical to having a healthy gut and a healthy

if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
well if it's not roger stone joining us now roger stone is usually my co-host on the war room
which runs three to six p.m central roger will be hosting the war room today but rob do will be
stepping in fulfilling my host duties but roger you're about to host the fourth hour what is on
your mind as we come back from christmas vacation well what a great great christmas it was oan and
my very best christmas wishes for you will find the entire info or crew um president certainly
ended up on an extraordinary high at the end of this holiday season the tax cut uh combined with the
the systematic exposure of the partisan nature of the witch hunt against him by
robert muller i think has left the president an extraordinarily strong position uh shockingly i saw
a piece on the hill today from my old watergate nemesis carl burnstein and carl burnstein says no
no it's not the fbi that's corrupt it's donald trump that is corrupt now this is of course the
same carl burnstein who as part of the woodward burnstein uh duo at the washington post ignored
his partner's uh naval intelligence background ignored his partners uh deep ties to uh the
white house chief of staff general al haig who very much like general uh michael kelly uh is
sleepwalking the 37th president to uh the uh who sleepwalk the 37th president towards the gallows
uh sam carl burnstein who of course ignored the fact that we now know and he knew then
that the watergate special prosecutors were communicating with judge john sarika in the
watergate trial uh which was uh both illegally inappropriate and would have tainted that trial
had we known that at the time and known that the trial of the watergate burglars and their appeal
was fixed in advance well there would have been no watergate there would have been no nixon
resignation but today carl burnstein ignores the extraordinary evidence that we saw last week
owen the tweets the emails the campaign contributions from muller's uh quizlings uh to hillary clinton
and barack obama the text messages quite extraordinary burnstein was blind then he
appears to be blind today wait a second roger wait a second roger the story says guys pull the
story back up on the hill because i need to make sure that i i have this headline correct the
headline is carl burnstein fbi isn't tainted trump's presidency is i mean roger it was obviously
trump that covered up the jfk assassination so it's obviously trump that's tainted trump was the
one that covered up the truth about the jfk assassination that was trump oh wait a second
that was the fbi and trump released those documents oh i'm sorry carl burnstein you're just another
libtard well this is extraordinary the fbi uh financed and promulgated the phony uh trump dossier
which was used incredibly as the rationale for uh the fisa court warrants that authorized the
surveillance of donald j trump and his campaign apparatus this uh makes watergate pale in comparison
using the state apparatus using the taxpayer financed surveillance capabilities of the u.s
government to spy on one's political opponents um well that's what watergate was supposedly
all about but at least the nixon operation used it uh misguided outside forces in this
case we have perverted the government for an illegal operation you're on the alex joneshaw i'm with
my colleague oh and shoyer and we will be right back
i can arizona you're on the air worldwide go ahead oh alex you can rent any day of the week
thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save america
and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well um and as a
longtime info wars listener i want to say thanks for the awesome brain force anthro plex my girlfriend
would like to say thanks for the anthro plex thank you um i use the bio true selenium the super
blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans the super blue is awesome
and thank you so much alex for the info wars life products they are quality i can't wait to get some
more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy absolutely we because then we
could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women understand that there's a
bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and
ourselves we can take our country back
if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
it's simply incredible to me that people will publish stories that are 100 percent wrong and
not just the stories they publish being wrong the truth is the exact opposite of what they're saying
i mean this has always been the way with cnn and msnbc if they say one thing on that those channels
you just assume the opposite is true but it's just like this paul krugman new york time says
2017 was the worst for america even though it was like the best carl bursting says
trump is tainted not the fbi it was the fbi that covered up the assassination of of jfk
president trump was the one that released the documents so these people present to you news
and stories that is not just completely inaccurate it is in fact the exact opposite of the truth so
here is the lim tarred carl burnstein saying trump is tainted not the fbi even though we have
all the evidence to the contrary everybody else is the issue here not donald trump and his actions
are those around around him the key word in all of this that he keeps using is tainted there's only
one institution that really has been tainted through these months and that is the trump presidency
it's tainted by the president's lives by his disrespect for american institutions operating
under the law with traditional american democracy and the instruments thereof
he's contemptuous of those instruments and what we're seeing in these constant attacks
which are undermining indeed confidence in the legitimate uh institutions of our government
which are trying to do their job uh if the president is talking about his investigation
is going to end very soon and with him being exonerated he ought to welcome all this instead
of attacking constantly uh he's doing a grave disservice uh to our democracy and the really
awful thing is that republicans particularly in congress but also an awful lot of the republican
quote establishment and voters are going along and enabling him to make these claims and make
everything the issue but what really happened here and has our democracy been and our elections
been undermined with some cooperation from the trump campaign from members of his family from
the president himself the answer might be no he ought to welcome the answer if indeed things are
as he claims what an unabashed liar roger if i was on that set it would it would take every
ounce of my integrity not to sock him right in the face you know the the funny thing oh and is i
know carl bernstein and i kind of like him i mean he's actually a pretty decent guy to have a beer
with and kind of joke around he's not a bad guy but in this case i'm really disappointed because
bernstein in the past has been a guy who has been willing to go where the facts lead him he wrote a
terrific piece for rolling stone some 15 years ago about the central intelligences uh uh co-opting
and uh and getting into using mainstream media uh and paying mainstream media reporters in this
case he seems to be antithetical to the facts he she read the facts lead and the facts show that
the fbi has very very uh uh sadly been politicized and their mission has been corrupted uh so
disappointment rather than anger at carl bernstein because frankly he knows better the old carl
bernstein would have been writing about the corruption of the fbi not helping poo poo it
and cover it up you know i'm glad that you brought me back down to earth by saying that roger because
you know when we talk about these political things and people just spout out lies i mean again this is
why people like well why do you get so mad they're lying i mean this guy's just lying and then people
actually believe it i mean why do you think let me ask you you know carl he's a nice guy you guys
go out and have a good time i believe that that's true we're all human at the end of this so what
motivates him to i mean does he really believe what he's saying well it has to be a at this point in
his career a political point of view but uh one cannot look at the stunning evidence that we saw
regarding peter strach regarding uh the corruption of the fbi and just write it off as meaningless
look we saw this theme from brian stelter last week when he said trump is undermining law enforcement
and he's one undermining respect uh you know for our law enforcement institutions no what he's doing
is criticizing people who have burrowed their way into law enforcement and have corrupted that process
there's a very substantial difference they're trying to poke themselves in the credibility of the
fbi and the credibility of the cia you see john brennan the former cia director trying to do this
constantly but the sad fact is those institutions have been politicized and they no longer stand
for the rule of law they had been engaged in a massive uh corruption of our electoral process
and the cover-up of massive crimes uh it's it's very very sad in my opinion you know uh the oh
and the other thing on my mind today uh is the fact that i predicted last week on the alex jones
show and on the war room that uh the special counsel mr mulier will seek to get the upper hand
again in his epic battle to take down the president through the indictment of a member of the president's
immediate family his son-in-law jerry kushner now we know that general mike flinn who i believe is a
great patriot and who i know for a fact continues to be a hundred percent supportive of the trump
administration and this president and his mission has testified that a senior member of the presidential
transition instructed him to reach out to the russian ambassador to set up a meeting let me stress
that the action by general flinn and reaching out to the ambassador is entirely legal is within the
scope of general flinn's responsibilities as the national security advisor now if that uh was not
the president who gave that instruction but a senior member of the presidential transition
the only senior member of the transition who would have that authority would be mr kushner
now whether mr kushner has dissembled about that or whether he's been tricked into denying it
in the many hours of of interrogation that he's had from both the fbi and the senate and house
committees we don't know but i could see a scenario in which mewler seeks to get the
upper hand again by bringing a process indictment against kushner as he had against general flinn
to me this would be the perfect opportunity now while the president is on a political high
to pardon both general flinn a great patriot and his son-in-law who in this case i think has
done nothing wrong and put mewler back on his heels that is both my prediction and my wish
today earlier today the president's pardon me general flinn's brother joseph flinn called for
the president to pardon uh michael flinn again uh a great patriot so i say from joe flinn's mouth
to god's ear well and i do believe that there was a moment where trump was addressing members of the
press where he kind of floated the idea out there about thinking about pardoning mike flinney
obviously didn't want to commit to it but you know the reason why they're so upset with president
trump is the alphabet bureaucracies don't like the fact that they can't put out misinformation
and lies without trump addressing it on twitter they don't like that they like to be able to lie to
the public and not have the president set the record straight so they don't like that then on
the other end of it in the media they don't like the fact that trump is pushing back i think that
that's honestly what bothers the carl bernstein's in the media the fact that they'll say something or
report something inaccurate and then trump goes on twitter or does a presser and he says no that's
fake news no your fake news your fake news jimacosta i think that that's they don't want president
trump to push back they just want to be bullies without any pushback that's why it's absolutely
essential the president never give up his twitter feed and never be talked out of not tweeting
from the heart i'm roger stone with my co-host oh and shoyer we're on the alex joneshow and
we'll be right back

dot com you're listening to the alex jones show he's going the distance he's going for speed she's
he's going the distance he's crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
this is the fourth hour of the alex jones show oh and shroyer roger stone with you
breaking through the lies and misinformation of the mainstream media which has never been
been more apparent than it is well then it was in 2017 and that it is now all you have to do is
look at the clear bias in the media coverage of trump you can compare that to presidents in the
past oh wait no you can't because there's never been anything like it and you know that's a story
roger that kind of gets lost in translation i mean you look at the numbers there's never been a
president get as much media coverage it's not even close in fact the negative coverage of president
trump probably doubles any coverage of any prior president no you're exactly right oh and i think
these things have to be seen in in some context uh let's look at at some of the things that said
by our previous about our previous presidents uh andrew jackson he was vulgar uh he was crude
uh he was outrageous he was a brawler considered today one of our greatest presidents
theora roosevelt he was an egomaniac he was a braggart he was a lightweight he was outrageous
oops once again one of our greatest presidents see donald trump doesn't fit the mold of the uh
career politician he's not a guy with a wet finger in the wind trying to find out what to say in order
to be popular he speaks from the heart he speaks from the gut he speaks from instinct he doesn't
take polls to find out what he should and should not be saying and so far he's going to be uh one
of our most successful presidents we've already seen a record stock market unemployment at all
time lows the housing market uh in one of the greatest booms of all time the libtards don't
want to admit it but he's on his way to an easy reelection and those who are wringing their hands
about the 2018 elections uh are way premature the 2018 elections are not tomorrow they're well
over a year from now and i predict a republican triumph if the president sticks to his current
agenda oh and i'd be remiss if i didn't mention the fact that we have uh extended all of the
new year's specials at the info war store and these will run through the end of the year with
free shipping you can put your best foot forward and spend less and achieve all of your new year's
resolutions with some of these incredible products we're talking about micro zx back and stop now

colloidal product out there it's 67 percent off my all-time favorite brain force plus get a case

know about you but for me it gives me mental clarity gives me mental energy helps me work another
five six hours a day brain force plus at an extraordinary 50 off now alpha power which
i really think melds the best of the old in the new some of the most ancient and effective chinese
herbs melded with some of the very best cutting edge uh natural substances today for a formula that
gives you peak performance both physical and mental alpha force at 50 percent off so these are just
some of the extraordinary sales now alex jones has decided to extend these incredible prices
through the end of the year folks help yourself help us pay for the war room and the incredible
expansion we're having here at info wars by going to the info wars store now you can help us and you
can help the fight for freedom and truth by doing your shopping at the info wars store today
you know it's a it's a it's funny roger because i was just thinking the other day i ran out a
hand soap and i was like oh i got to go to the store and get new hands open i was like wait a
second we sell hand soap we sell household items now so when you think about hand soap and shampoo
when you run out think info wars store dot com instead of going to the grocery store that's
another way you can support us it's something that we don't talk about enough on the auto
ship function i really found to be excellent because frankly i'm so busy that i forget to
reorder and i got caught short without brain force on a long trip or had to give a couple of
speeches and frankly it was difficult so uh i really like the auto ship function that way
you're never without these products uh and frankly uh using them consistency consistently
will give you the very best result so uh i really urge folks to use the auto ship
function on the on the info wars store site oh and i gave a uh an interview to c span last
friday which ran the uh sunday in their news makers program where i reiterated the claims
that i've made here on the alex jones show that i firmly believe that the two party duopoly that
have run this country into the ground the elites of both parties uh if they are unsuccessful in
undermining and removing this president through the special counsel process of robber the executioner
muller they will move to a 25th amendment strategy now i admit that that may be hard to believe
today because the president ended the year or is ending the year on such an incredible high
having jammed through his historic tax cuts which i believe will turbocharge this economy
and with the partisanship uh and the naked uh uh mentality of muller's hit squad now revealed for
all americans to see do not underestimate the deep enmity that the ruling elite who have run this
country in the ground have for this president and his politics i believe they will be be back on his
throat like a pack of hyenas in 2018 and i do believe that the president will persevere once
again i call for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the uranium one matter far more
effective than firing muller and allowing the mainstream media to whip up a hysteria about
a cover-up the president should demand that the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor
in the matter of uranium one that would once again bring mr muller mr comey mr mccabe and
mr rozenstein under federal investigation for their own crimes in the cover-up of uranium one
and the sale of 20 of our strategic uranium reserves to a company controlled by the kremlin you
talk about russian collusion folks there it is hillary clinton and her husband and the entire
obama uh justice department up to their hips in collusion with the russians to steal that important
commodity well it's going to be interesting to see if they want to push this narrative on through
the midterms roger because what we're seeing right now is that the gop is seeing record funding so
the gop is getting all this funding so does that mean they're going to support the candidates that
aren't career politicians that want to go along with trump's agenda or are they just going to put
in a bunch of rhinos and try to bury those that want to go along with trump's agenda that's going
to be an interesting story to watch but if they continue to push the russian narrative and a new
congress gets in that's behind trump well look out hillary clinton

you're listening to the alex jones show
if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex jones
welcome back i'm your co-host roger stone here sitting in for the great alex jones uh with my
colleague oen schreuer normally you can see us both on the war room uh which uh i usually join
at five o'clock eastern today we'll go right into the war room but sitting in for oen today
will be my colleague rob do you know oen nothing i have ever done on info wars has had the reaction
that we got last week from our visit to a gun range there in austin texas where i had the privilege
of uh shooting some of the most extraordinary firearms uh that i have ever uh seen uh the
libtards brains literally exploded into a pink mist over this uh with claims falsely that we were
in some way advocating uh violence or insurrection just the opposite is true we do not advocate
either we will however defend our families we will defend our constitution it's as you know
it's antifa who advocates of violence it's antifa who wears black masks on their faces
we believe in peace we believe in law and order but we are not patsies now last night i took my
family to a local italian eatery here in the fort lauderdale area where i was confronted by punks
telling me that i was the most despicable human being on the face of the planet this happens
virtually every single day uh when libtards feel that they can invade your personal space
on my flight from austin to new york city the other day i was trying to doze only to be awoken
with somebody who had a camera right in my face uh once again insisting uh that i was a despicable
human being because i stand up for our president and for our constitution and i speak out about
about against the deep state in their efforts to convert this country uh to a a non-democratic
uh uh gulag no i'm not going to be silenced i'm not going to be threatened i'm not going
to be intimidated by your threats but once again we are not the ones who advocate violence we
renounce violence i'm proud of my friendship with this president i'm proud to stand with him and i
will continue to speak out against the illegitimate efforts to take him out either through some
illicit uh trumped up process charge by mr. muhler or by a deep state takedown under the
25th amendment roger i'm actually glad that you told that story because i want to provide
an example on the other end of the spectrum i went out for dinner last night and a group of
young gentlemen came up to me who were trump supporters and info wars fans and shockingly
unlike your experience they were polite they were kind they shook my hand we had a friendly
conversation and instead of just shoving a camera in my face they asked if they could take a picture
with me and i obliged so that's amazing the difference between the anti trumpers and the
trumpers i mean all you have to do is just look at their character look at how they treat
the fellow human being and you can see who the real scum is no you're absolutely right oh and i
find it to be about a 50 50 uh experience in other words when i went to a home slice one of
my favorite spots in austin the other day for a quick pizza in between breaks on info wars
um i was approached by a group of folks uh mixed men and women uh young people who are big info
wars fans wanted a selfie they were polite they were complimentary it was a great experience
they said tell alex jones how much we love him tell owens schreyer how much we love him
no we've got our fans out there there's no question i find it uh that it's geographic
if in your you're in new york city you're going to find more loud mouths and more scumbags if
you're in austin texas uh other parts of texas you're going to find more patriots uh but there's
no excuse for lack of manners there's no excuse for the rudeness uh in the name calling but as
i have said as one of stone's rules the only thing worse than being talked about is not being
not being talked about and it is better to be infamous than never be famous at all well you
know roger the thing that doesn't get talked about enough is just by publicly supporting
trump or publicly voicing your conservative political ideologies you're you're hated you're
scorned you're dehumanized and i don't think people understand that i didn't get into political
media so that people would hate me i didn't get into political media so that people will be looking
out for me and to try to bring me down oh i got it in it because i have political ideas and i have
conservative beliefs but just like you said when you when you run into you know conservatives or
fans of ours it's always it's always a love fest we're always getting along everyone's smiling
having a great conversation when you run into a libtard or antifa or a trump hater it's always
hate they're always cursing they're angry they're violent and so this is why i understand i was telling
this story earlier i don't know if you heard it but i was back in town in st louis over christmas
break and i had some some friends that i hadn't seen in a long long time but they know what i do now
and they're like man oh and what happened to you you used to be so happy used to be so cool used to
be smiling and friendly and nice everyone now you're just this hateful fear monger full of anger
and rage i'm like wait a second no i'm not i'm the same guy i've always been they're the ones that
are filled with hate and rage and and and this is the key that i discovered roger and this is what
they don't understand i i have such a capacity for love and i love fellow humans so much that when
i see my fellow human under attack whether it be the poison in the water whether it be with abortion
whether it be with the vaccines see now you're attacking something i love that's an instinct
to get fired up about that that doesn't mean we're hateful or angry that means we have a defense
of something we love we're not driven by hate we're driven by love they're genuinely driven by
hate of donald trump they're driven by hate of alex jones and they're driven by hate of our
political ideologies the left the democrat party has become the biggest hate group in the history
of this country now i think that's absolutely true i must tell you prior to 2016 i had many many
friends who were democrats uh many professional democrats many friends in the media who i did
not see eye to eye with and in all cases those relations were respectful and cordial i had
friends at cnn i got along pretty well with anderson cooper and brian stelter and others
there but i've seen the deterioration of that and it's not because of us it's because of them
there is a new militancy a a new outrage on the left where they just cannot accept the results
of the last election look this is really really simple the elections over you lost we put up with
eight years of barack obama i didn't like the obama presidency i didn't like uh the obama
policies but i realized the elections had been taken and were over and that we lost probably
because we nominated two extraordinarily weak candidates what you can't fathom today is their
inability to accept the results of the last election i saw hillary clinton's photo today
she looks like she's gained about 50 pounds since the election looks to me like she can't
accept the results either owen yeah and she's got you know a boot on her foot walking around
people have rumored that that might be some ankle brace uh bracelet you know because she's uh
you know on house arrest or she can't leave the country or whatever i don't know if any of that's
true but you know she was never healthy roger i mean she's been sickly ever since this for years
now i mean she's got holes in her tongue she can't stop coughing she coughs up little green goblins
into a cup she falls over and faints you know she looks like oh the balloons in the sky oh you know
so i mean yeah hillary clinton that's what it is you're always attracted to something similar to
you hillary clinton is a sick corrupt individual so of course all the sick corrupt individuals
in society would would gravitate towards hillary clinton it actually makes sense choose to take

you're listening to the alex jones show
the alex jones show just a good old boy
boy never meaning no harm
oh and welcome back we're here on the alex jones show with my colleague oan schreuer
and one thing oh and i are going to do together in the new year is to bring more and more young
a dynamic conservative congressional candidates to the public consciousness it was oan schreuer
who discovered hard-charging omar navarro challenging maxine waters in california's 39th district
we had carla spaulding challenging debora waserman schultz in the fort lauderdale district in
florida and we are going to be interviewing joy via a joy villa pardon me who is i think best known
as the singer entertainer who wore a make america great dress to the grammy's now she has emerged as
one of the most are effective and articulate proponents of this president and his reform agenda
she is announced her intention to seek a congressional seat in the state of florida
uh i expect an announcement from her early next year uh but she was in the news this past week
because she has filed a complaint with the dc metropolitan police claiming that former
campaign manager for donald trump cori luandowski sexually assaulted her specifically slapping her
on the rump at a public party at the trump hotel in washington dc as i understand the media reports
an inebriated luandowski approached her was introduced by a mutual friend
whereupon he smacked her on the bottom she asked him to stop and then he smacked her again
uh now we have a clip of mr luandowski uh in his response and in all fairness let's roll that so
that he can have his say here as well singer joy villa a trump supporter filed a sexual assault
complaint against former trump campaign manager cori luandowski villa claims that she was assaulted
at a party at the trump international hotel in washington last month joining us now is
cori luandowski and cori of course they'd like to have your response uh to to villa's accusations
well charles i think uh as someone who's been through this you understand that there is a due
process and uh there is a process which they will go through to determine a person's innocence
which i think you've been through and you understand and you respect it yeah i think everyone
understands the respect in this but a lot of people are wondering why someone who's so close to
to president trump as you are someone who's been rooting for president trump like joy has
evade her what do you think is motivating her uh with with these accusations where she says she
has at least two witnesses you know charles that's a question for her i'm not here to speak for joy
what i am here to do is to speak for me and uh what i am going to do is to let the process play
forward just as you did when you're accused of sexual harassment in your own case uh there you
have it cori luandowski's response now i think it is important to know that joy villa has uh two
witnesses and is my understanding the dc metropolitan police have obtained the security camera footage
from that night at the trump hotel so indeed let's let the process uh uh go forward i'm a believer in
due process but i must say i believe joy villa i have found her to be an articulate uh and a
vivacious uh a proponent of the president's agenda i think that her support for the president
is most valuable and we'll be covering both sides of this story oh and well i got a couple things
to say here um let me just start with the sexual assault allegations now i'm not talking about this
individual case i'm just saying in general um is slapping someone on the butt wants really sexual
assault i mean is this really something that needs to go to court i guess you can ask that uh women
that but if a woman slapped me on the butt a couple times because she was drunk uh i wouldn't be
thinking about a lawsuit you've got stories where women are saying trump asked me for my phone number
so i mean we're really skating on a thin line here i think with what is sexual assault and i think
we need to remember that there are actual victims out there that you know deal with penetration
and rape like bill clinton's victims so you know before you start throwing around sexual
assault because someone you know patted you on the butt or whatever or asked for a phone number
i think we need to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves here again i'm not necessarily
commenting on that one story just commenting overall in general but then roger oh my gosh you
want to talk about bombshell you're telling me that the dc metropolitan police are reviewing
footage of this alleged sexual assault is that what you said that that's my understanding now
okay but real quick i just got a pause right there so so so the dc metrics wow the dc metropolitan
police are reviewing footage of cor lewandowski allegedly slapping joy villas but yet nothing
on set rich i can't get any footage on set rich i can't get any investigation to set rich
we get nothing on set rich and we have police looking at footage of joy villa and cor lewandowski
boy if that doesn't show you how backwards and twisted justices right now i don't know what
does sorry roger this is just crazy well but in this case uh miss villa has filed a formal
complaint with the dc police oh and there's a huge difference between somebody smacking another
person and asking for a telephone number yes under the laws of the district of columbia
that does amount to sexual battery to sexual assault so let's let the process carry through
here what i do object to is this idea that for example because lee and tweeden was once a
playboy model she cannot be sexually harassed or or assaulted or that because there is a photo
of joy villa that is somewhat sexy that she cannot be sexually assaulted i firmly firmly
disagree let's let the process uh take it it's a course but photos of her like we're showing now
are have nothing to do with what transpired because someone is photo is depicted in a
sexy attire does not mean that they cannot be sexually assaulted they most definitely can
and i'm just glad i mean again you know my opinions are my opinions i would hope that
from now on at least you know when people are going to make these allegations if you're seriously
going to make these allegations i mean at least follow through you know i'm saying if this is
going to happen at least follow through so 30 years down the road if someone wants to you know
run for office or something all of a sudden oh he assaulted me 30 years ago he can't run for
office now so i mean at least that's one thing i mean if you're gonna if you if you think you're
sexually assaulted at least you know move forward with some charges so at least that's one thing
well and she has she has done that which is the appropriate thing to do here look i have been a
critic of kori londowski that is no secret uh this is not the first time he's been accused
of manhandling a woman inappropriately uh there was an entire period in which the campaign of
donald trump got off message because of his alleged uh uh roughing up a reporter a woman
reporter during the campaign while at a campaign appearance here in florida so um there's a pattern
here that i find disturbing let's see where the process goes oan well and again um i think it's
not i saw no stories of the dc police looking at any camera footage the night of seth rich murder
i know it's a totally different story and everything that to me is just like whoa okay so uh who knows
if if they ever saw any of that footage but apparently uh investigations into seth rich may
or may not be um getting a little more interest well we've got uh just over a couple minutes left
here or just over a minute and a half left here roger before you go over to the war room what
are you guys going to be covering over there today well i think we're going to be talking
quite a bit about the the general flinn situation uh and the fact that his brother joseph has made a
very i think strong appeal for a pardon now is the time of year that the president uh can
met out mercy and has the full authority for a pardon i think a pardon for general flinn would
be appropriate he has clearly uh been entrapped let's be very clear first they illegally surveilled him
to learn everything he was doing then i imagine they came up with a list of questions and then
they burst into his office at eight o'clock in the morning when he had no attorney present
and the good general spoke to them openly uh they probably went through a list of questions
until they found some place where he contradicted himself to me the whole process is phony his
confession is phony and he's being crucified unfairly i hope with all my heart that the president's
will consider a pardon for general flinn like you i was encouraged the other day
when asked about this and the president said well let's see to me that was leaving the door open
and at least you know he's considering it or has thought about it so i would completely agree
general flinn wasn't trapped he does not belong uh he doesn't you know what's been charged against him
it's just made up it's ludicrous they made up the entire investigation roger stone
